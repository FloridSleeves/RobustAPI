{"api": "Cipher.init", "question": "Java 256-bit AES Password-Based Encryption: I need to implement 256 bit AES encryption, but all the examples I have found online use a \"KeyGenerator\" to generate a 256 bit key, but I would like to use my own passkey.

On decryption, the SecretKey is regenerated in exactly the same way, using using the password with the same salt and iteration parameters. Initialize the cipher with this key and the initialization vector stored with the message.", "origin": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/992019/"}
