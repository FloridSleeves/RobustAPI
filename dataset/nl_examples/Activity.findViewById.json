{"api": "Activity.findViewById", "question": "How to pause / sleep thread or process in Android?: I want to make a pause between two lines of code, Let me explain a bit:\n-> the user clicks a button (a card in fact) and I show it by changing the background of this button:\nthisbutton.setBackgroundResource(R.drawable.icon);\n-> after let's say 1 second, I need to go back to the previous state of the button by changing back its background:\nthisbutton.setBackgroundResource(R.drawable.defaultcard);\n-> I've tried to pause the thread between these two lines of code with:\ntry {\n    Thread.sleep(1000);\n} catch (InterruptedException e) {\n    // TODO Auto-generated catch block\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\nHowever, this does not work. Maybe it's the process and not the Thread that I need to pause?\nI've also tried (but it doesn't work):\nnew Reminder(5);\nWith this:\npublic class Reminder {\n        Timer timer;\n        public Reminder(int seconds) {\n            timer = new Timer();\n            timer.schedule(new RemindTask(), seconds*1000);\n        }\n\n        class RemindTask extends TimerTask {\n            public void run() {\n                System.out.format(\"Time's up!%n\");\n                timer.cancel(); //Terminate the timer thread\n            }\n        }  \n    }\nHow can I pause/sleep the thread or process?", "code": "private static class MyHandler extends Handler {}\nprivate final MyHandler mHandler = new MyHandler();\npublic static class MyRunnable implements Runnable {\n    private final WeakReference<Activity> mActivity;\n    public MyRunnable(Activity activity) {\n        mActivity = new WeakReference<>(activity);\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void run() throws Exception {\n        Activity activity = mActivity.get();\n        if (activity != null) {\n            Button btn = (Button) activity.findViewById(R.id.button);\n            btn.setBackgroundResource(R.drawable.defaultcard);\n        }\n    }\n}\nprivate MyRunnable mRunnable = new MyRunnable(this);\npublic void onClick(View view) {\n    my_button.setBackgroundResource(R.drawable.icon);\n    // Execute the Runnable in 2 seconds\n    mHandler.postDelayed(mRunnable, 2000);\n}", "explanation": "A more complex solution that avoids the memory leak subclasses the Handler and Runnable with static inner classes inside the activity since static inner classes do not hold an implicit reference to their outer class.", "origin": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1520887/", "rule": "Attempt to find a View by its ID using the `findViewById` method, ensuring that it returns a valid result (true).
