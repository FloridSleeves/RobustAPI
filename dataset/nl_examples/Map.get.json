{"api": "Map.get", "question": "How to increment a Map value in Java: Say I'm creating a word frequency list, using a Map (probably a HashMap), where each key is a String with the word that's being counted and the value is an Integer that's incremented each time a token of the word is found. Can you help me with this?", "code": "import java.util.HashMap;import java.util.Map;Map<String, Integer> freq = new HashMap<String, Integer>();Integer count = freq.get(word);if (count == null) {freq.put(word, 1);}else {freq.put(word, count + 1);}", "explanation": "If you look at the API for Map, get operations usually return null when the map does not contain the requested element. Note that this will make a solution.", "origin": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/81346/", "rule": "Obtain a value from a Map based on a specified key and handle it using an IF statement.\n"}
