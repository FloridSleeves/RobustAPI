For this program, I need to define several (in fact too many ~ 200) sets. I have researched and found that I could use ArrayLists in order to store integers.In the problem I am trying to solve, there are T (T being any integer) many different ArrayLists I need to create. I need to define a unique ArrayList for every value of T. For instance, for T=3 I will need to define three different ArrayLists where I will be able to store integers for every different index:ArrayList T1 = new ArrayList();ArrayList T2 = new ArrayList();ArrayList T3 = new ArrayList();The problem here is that I am clueless on how I may define as many ArrayLists as  T. I have tried to create a \"for loop\" in order to initialize these variables but as I expected it didn't turn out well (simply because I need different names for each ArrayList and I could not vary the name of every ArrayList) I was sure it wouldn't work (or at least I was sure that I was doing it wrong even if there is a way to do it - which I could not find by searching on the internet) but just to give an idea of what I was trying to do, the code looked like this:for (int i=1; i<T; i++) {    ArrayList T+i = new ArrayList(); //I tried to vary the name of the arraylist by adding the variable \"i\" next to T.}In the code above, I could not achieve to define indexes for the ArrayLists but please note that it would be extremely convenient if we can do this by adding indexes to ArrayLists.As this is my very first attempt on Dynamic Programming I am a little lost and I appreciate all of your help!

Thanks in advance.\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Map.get\n<<<code>>>: Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();\nmap.put(\"key1\", 1);\nmap.put(\"key2\", 2);\nmap.put(\"key3\", 3);\nint value = map.get(\"key2\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The get() method of the Map interface returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or null if this map contains no mapping for the key. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the maximum value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint max = Arrays.stream(array).max().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The max() method of the IntStream class returns the maximum element of this stream according to the natural order of its elements. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the minimum value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint min = Arrays.stream(array).min().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The min() method of the IntStream class returns the minimum element of this stream according to the natural order of its elements. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the average value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\ndouble average = Arrays.stream(array).average().getAsDouble();\n<<<explanation>>>: The average() method of the IntStream class returns the arithmetic average of elements of this stream, or 0.0 if the stream is empty. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the median value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\ndouble median = Arrays.stream(array).sorted().skip(array.length / 2).findFirst().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sorted() method of the IntStream class returns a stream consisting of the elements of this stream, sorted according to natural order. This is a intermediate operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the standard deviation value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\ndouble standardDeviation = Math.sqrt(Arrays.stream(array).mapToDouble(x -> Math.pow(x - Arrays.stream(array).average().getAsDouble(), 2)).average().getAsDouble());\n<<<explanation>>>: The mapToDouble() method of the IntStream class returns an IntStream consisting of the results of applying the given function to the elements of this stream.
