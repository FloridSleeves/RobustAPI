Getting access to file lines in the currently parsing xml file: :When parsing an XML document, you can set a locator, the locator will tell you what current line and column number your are currently on when different events fire. I am wondering, how can I get the contents of the line, do I have to pass the file, read it into an array myself, isn't this already done by the sax handler, since it is giving me access to the locator, there has to be away to also access the file that the handler is currently working with.

If no byte is available because the end of the stream has been reached, the value -1 is returned. This is a blocking operation.
