This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to convert a char array to a String in Java?\nPlease using this api: String.valueOf.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: String.valueOf\n<<<code>>>: char[] chars = {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'};\nString str = String.valueOf(chars);\n<<<explanation>>>: The valueOf() method of the String class returns a string representation of the specified array of characters. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to convert a String to a byte array in Java?\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: String.getBytes\n<<<code>>>: String str = \"Hello\";\nbyte[] bytes = str.getBytes();\n<<<explanation>>>: The getBytes() method of the String class returns a new byte array containing the bytes of this string. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to convert a byte array to a String in Java?\nPlease using this api: new String.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: new String\n<<<code>>>: byte[] bytes = {72, 101, 108, 108, 111};\nString str = new String(bytes);\n<<<explanation>>>: The String(byte[] bytes) constructor of the String class creates a new String by decoding the specified array of bytes using the platform's default charset. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to convert a String to a byte array in Java?\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: String.getBytes\n<<<code>>>: String str = \"Hello\";\nbyte[] bytes = str.getBytes();\n<<<explanation>>>: The getBytes() method of the String class returns a new byte array containing the bytes of this string.
