I'm looking to make my if statement search for the delimiter - then use the apply the integers before and after to a variable. E.G. if they inputted 1-50 it would apply 1 to int a and 50 to int b. Here's the if statement i'm looking to apply it to. It would come from the input variable :     if (yes.equalsIgnoreCase(\"no\")){       if (a.equalsIgnoreCase(answer) && input.equalsIgnoreCase(\"instant\")){           Thread.sleep(1);       }       else if (a.equalsIgnoreCase(answer) && input.equalsIgnoreCase(\"generate\")){           Thread.sleep(randomInt);       }       else if (a.equalsIgnoreCase(answer) && !input.equalsIgnoreCase(\"generate\") && !input.equalsIgnoreCase(\"instant\")){       int x =Integer.parseInt(input);       x = x*60000;       Thread.sleep(x);       }       else if (a.equals(\"quit\" )){           System.exit(0);       }       else if (a.equals(\"Quit\")){           System.exit(0);       }       else if (a.equals(\"\")){       }       else{              JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null,\"Please check the answer then try again \");              i = i-2;           }Thanks for any help.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.
