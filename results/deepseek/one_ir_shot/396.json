This method may be called repeatedly to iterate through the collection, or intermixed with calls to hasNext() to check for the presence of additional elements.\nQuestion: How can I convert a string to an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.asList.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.asList\n<<<code>>>: String[] array = {\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"};\nList<String> list = Arrays.asList(array);\n<<<explanation>>>: The asList() method of the Arrays class returns a fixed-size list backed by the specified array. This method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based APIs, in combination with Collection.toArray(). The returned list is serializable and implements RandomAccess.\nQuestion: How can I convert a string to an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: String.split.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: String.split\n<<<code>>>: String str = \"a,b,c\";\nString[] array = str.split(\",\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The split() method of the String class returns a string array that is split according to the given regular expression. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I convert a string to an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: String.toCharArray.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: String.toCharArray\n<<<code>>>: String str = \"abc\";\nchar[] array = str.toCharArray();\n<<<explanation>>>: The toCharArray() method of the String class returns a newly allocated character array whose length is the length of this string and whose contents are initialized to contain the characters of this string. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I convert a string to an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: String.toCharArray.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: String.toCharArray\n<<<code>>>: String str = \"abc\";\nchar[] array = str.toCharArray();\n<<<explanation>>>: The toCharArray() method of the String class returns a newly allocated character array whose length is the length of this string and whose contents are initialized to contain the characters of this string.
