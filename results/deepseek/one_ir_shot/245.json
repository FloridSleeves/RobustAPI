Thanks to both answerers!\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\nint bytesRead = inputStream.read(buffer);\n<<<explanation>>>: The read() method of the InputStream class reads a sequence of bytes from this input stream and stores them into the buffer array b. It returns the total number of bytes read into the buffer, or -1 if there is no more data because the end of the stream has been reached. This is a blocking operation.
