This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: What Java class allows to write to a file, both in Binary and ASCII?: :I need to write files, with Headers in ASCII and values in Binary.For now, I'm using this:File file = new File(\"~/myfile\");FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(file);// Write in ASCIIout.write((\"This is a header\\n\").getBytes());// Write a byte[] is quite easybyte[] buffer = new buffer[4];out.write(buffer, 0, 4);// Write an int in binary gets complicatedout.write(ByteBuffer.allocate(4).putInt(6).array());//Write a float in binary gets even more complicatedout.write(ByteBuffer.allocate(4).order(ByteOrder.BIG_ENDIAN)        .putFloat(4.5).array());The problem is that it's very slow (in terms of performance) to write that way, way slower than writing the values in ASCII actually. But it should be shorter since in I'm writing less data.I've looked at other Java classes, and it seems to me that they are either only for ASCII writing, or only for Binary writing.Would you have any other proposition for this problem ?\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.

This is a primitive operation.\nQuestion: How can I get the current date and time in Java?\nPlease using this api: LocalDateTime.now.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: LocalDateTime.now\n<<<code>>>: LocalDateTime now = LocalDateTime.now();\n<<<explanation>>>: The now() method of the LocalDateTime class returns the current date-time. This is a static factory method.\nQuestion: How can I get the current date in Java?\nPlease using this api: LocalDate.now.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: LocalDate.now\n<<<code>>>: LocalDate now = LocalDate.now();\n<<<explanation>>>: The now() method of the LocalDate class returns the current date. This is a static factory method.\nQuestion: How can I get the current time in Java?\nPlease using this api: LocalTime.now.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: LocalTime.now\n<<<code>>>: LocalTime now = LocalTime.now();\n<<<explanation>>>: The now() method of the LocalTime class returns the current time. This is a static factory method.\nQuestion: How can I get the current date and time in Java?\nPlease using this api: Instant.now.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Instant.now\n<<<code>>>: Instant now = Instant.now();\n<<<explanation>>>: The now() method of the Instant class returns the current date-time. This is a static factory method.\nQuestion: How can I get the current date and time in Java?\nPlease using this api: Calendar.getInstance.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Calendar.getInstance\n<<<code>>>: Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();\n<<<explanation>>>: The getInstance() method of the Calendar class returns a Calendar object representing the current date and time. This is a static factory method.\nQuestion: How can I get the current date and time in Java?\nPlease using this api: System.currentTimeMillis.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: System.currentTimeMillis\n<<<code>>>: long currentTimeMillis = System.currentTimeMillis();\n<<<explanation>>>: The currentTimeMillis() method of the System class returns the current time in milliseconds. This is a static method.\nQuestion: How can I get the current date and time in Java?\nPlease using this api: System.nanoTime.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: System.nanoTime\n<<<code>>>: long nanoTime = System.nanoTime();\n<<<explanation>>>: The nanoTime() method of the System class returns the current time in nanoseconds. This is a static method.\nQuestion: How can I get the current date and time in Java?\nPlease using this api: System.currentTimeMillis.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: System.currentTimeMillis\n<<<code>>>: long currentTimeMillis = System.currentTimeMillis();\n<<<explanation>>>: The currentTimeMillis() method of the System class returns the current time in milliseconds.
