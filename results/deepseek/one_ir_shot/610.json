For example if the input data is 2, 4, 8, 9 then the function would be 2 + 4x + 8x^2 + 9x^3.Now I do know how to process the input data etc. but I don't know how to declare a variable that has no value, for example I declared a variable x = double, but I still have to initialize it but I don't want to give x a value at this point yet?So how can I write a method that for example returns 'x' to the power of something?This is what I have at the moment (it still doesn't work of course)public class Interpol {public static void main(String []args) {    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);        //get user input (polynomial coefficients and interval values x1 and x2)        ArrayList<Double> polynomialCoefficients = new ArrayList<Double>();        int amountCoefficients = 0;        while (scanner.hasNextDouble()) {            polynomialCoefficients.add(scanner.nextDouble());            amountCoefficients++;        }        String in = scanner.next();        double x1 = scanner.nextDouble();        double x2 = scanner.nextDouble();        //call method f to determine the polynomial function        double x;        double[] termsFunction = new double[amountCoefficients];        for (int i = 0; i < polynomialCoefficients.size(); i++) {            termsFunction[i] = f(i, polynomialCoefficients.get(i));        }        //call method findaroot to determine the root        //print result}//determine function of which a root is to be foundpublic static double f(int i, double polynomialCoefficient) {    if (i == 0) {        return polynomialCoefficient;    }    double x;    return polynomialCoefficient * (Math.pow(x, i));}/*  //rounds off d to 3 decimals public static double rnd(double d) {}//returns a root in this interval, recursive function public static double findaroot{double x1, double x2) {}*/}\nPlease using this api: List.get.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.
