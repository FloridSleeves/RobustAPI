This is an intermediate operation.\nQuestion: How can I get the third element of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint third = Arrays.stream(array).skip(2).findFirst().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The skip() method of the Stream interface returns a stream consisting of the remaining elements of this stream after discarding the first n elements of the stream. This is an intermediate operation.\nQuestion: How can I get the fourth element of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint fourth = Arrays.stream(array).skip(3).findFirst().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The skip() method of the Stream interface returns a stream consisting of the remaining elements of this stream after discarding the first n elements of the stream. This is an intermediate operation.\nQuestion: How can I get the fifth element of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint fifth = Arrays.stream(array).skip(4).findFirst().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The skip() method of the Stream interface returns a stream consisting of the remaining elements of this stream after discarding the first n elements of the stream.
