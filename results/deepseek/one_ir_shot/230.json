It currently handles GET requests fine. However, whilst using POST the buffered reader seems to hang. When the request is stopped the rest of the input stream is read via the buffered reader. I have found a few things on google. I have tried changing the CRLF and the protocol version from 1.1 to 1.0 (browsers automatically make requests as 1.1) Any ideas or help would be appreciated.

Thanks\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: int read = inputStream.read();\n<<<explanation>>>: The read() method of the InputStream class reads the next byte of data from the input stream. If no byte is available because the end of the stream has been reached, the value -1 is returned. This is a blocking call.
