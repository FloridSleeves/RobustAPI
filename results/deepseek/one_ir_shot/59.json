It is a save game file but I can't use java.util.Properties for this (it is under the specification). I have to read the entire file and ignore commented lines and the keys that are not relevant in some classes. These properties are unique but they may be sorted in any order. My file current file looks like this:# BioplayerOrigin=NewlandsplayerClass=Warlock# ArmorplayerHelmet=emptyplayerUpperArmor=armor900playerBottomArmor=armor457playerBoots=boot109etcThese properties are going to be written and placed according to the player's progress and the filereader would have to reach the end of file and get only the matched keys. I've tried different approaches but so far nothing came close to the results that I would had using java.util.Properties.

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I get the current date and time in Java?\nPlease using this api: Date.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Date\n<<<code>>>: Date date = new Date();\n<<<explanation>>>: The Date() constructor of the Date class creates a new Date object representing the current date and time. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I get the current date and time in Java?\nPlease using this api: System.currentTimeMillis.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: System.currentTimeMillis\n<<<code>>>: long currentTimeMillis = System.currentTimeMillis();\n<<<explanation>>>: The currentTimeMillis() method of the System class returns the current time in milliseconds. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I get the current date and time in Java?\nPlease using this api: Instant.now.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Instant.now\n<<<code>>>: Instant now = Instant.now();\n<<<explanation>>>: The now() method of the Instant class returns the current date-time using the system clock and default time-zone. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I get the current date and time in Java?\nPlease using this api: ZonedDateTime.now.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: ZonedDateTime.now\n<<<code>>>: ZonedDateTime now = ZonedDateTime.now();\n<<<explanation>>>: The now() method of the ZonedDateTime class returns the current date-time using the system clock and default time-zone. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I get the current date and time in Java?\nPlease using this api: LocalDate.now.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: LocalDate.now\n<<<code>>>: LocalDate now = LocalDate.now();\n<<<explanation>>>: The now() method of the LocalDate class returns the current date using the system clock and default time-zone. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I get the current date and time in Java?\nPlease using this api: LocalTime.now.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: LocalTime.now\n<<<code>>>: LocalTime now = LocalTime.now();\n<<<explanation>>>: The now() method of the LocalTime class returns the current time using the system clock and default time-zone.
