This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the average value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\ndouble average = Arrays.stream(array).average().getAsDouble();\n<<<explanation>>>: The average() method of the IntStream class returns the average of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the median value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\ndouble median = Arrays.stream(array).sorted().skip((array.length - 1) / 2).limit(2 - array.length % 2).average().getAsDouble();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sorted() method of the IntStream class returns a stream consisting of the elements of this stream, sorted according to natural order. This is a intermediate operation. The skip() method of the IntStream class returns a stream consisting of the remaining elements of this stream after discarding the first n elements of the stream. This is a intermediate operation. The limit() method of the IntStream class returns a stream consisting of the remaining elements of this stream after discarding the first n elements of the stream. This is a intermediate operation. The average() method of the IntStream class returns the average of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the mode value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint mode = Arrays.stream(array).collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Function.identity(), Collectors.counting())).entrySet().stream().max(Map.Entry.comparingByValue()).get().getKey();\n<<<explanation>>>: The collect() method of the IntStream class returns a Collector that accumulates elements into a new collection. This is a intermediate operation. The groupingBy() method of the Collectors class returns a Collector that groups elements according to a classification function. This is a intermediate operation. The counting() method of the Collectors class returns a Collector that counts the number of elements in each group. This is a intermediate operation. The entrySet() method of the Map class returns a Set view of the mappings contained in this map. This is a intermediate operation. The max() method of the Stream class returns an Optional describing the maximum element of this stream according to the provided Comparator. This is a intermediate operation."}
