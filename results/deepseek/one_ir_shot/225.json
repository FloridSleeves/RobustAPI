The value byte is returned as an int in the range 0 to 255. If no byte is available because the end of the stream has been reached, the value -1 is returned. This method blocks until input data is available, the end of the stream is detected, or an exception is thrown.\nQuestion: How to run a mvn command from a java program?: :I am building a Java program for automating a procedure in my server side.
