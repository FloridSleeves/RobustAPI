It gives a different score every time, which I need to save to a String (or file, but I guess a string would be easier, because I need it to be empty at every new call for the database).I want to store all the scores by going through the loop, and then adding a , after each score (to keep them seperate) but my code isn't working because a part of the code is outside the for loop. How do I fix this? Or are there better/other methods to do what I want to create?DatabaseHandler db = new DatabaseHandler(camera.this);List<Database> contacts = db.getAllContacts();for (Database contact : contacts) {    String test = contact.getMP();    StringWriter stringWriter = new StringWriter();    PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(stringWriter);    printWriter.println(test);}  printWriter.flush();printWriter.close();return stringWriter.toString();\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.
