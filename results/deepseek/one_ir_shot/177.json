As the example in the link says, when writing a struct like this:struct { char c; int i;} a;to a binary file, the compiler will usually leave an unnamed, unused hole between the char and int fields, to ensure that the int field is properly aligned. How could I to create an exact replica of the binary output file (generated in C), using a different language (in my case, Java)?Is there an automatic way to apply C padding in Java output?
