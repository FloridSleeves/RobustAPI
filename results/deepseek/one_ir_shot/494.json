If not, add the record to the masterList.For each Record in masterList, check if it's in updatedIds. If not, it is obsolete, so remove it from masterList.The straightforward code for this is as follows:for (Integer updId : updatedIds) {    boolean hasMapping = false;    for (Record rec : masterList) {        if (rec.getId() == updId) { hasMapping = true; break; }    }    if (!hasMapping) {        //TODO add updId to masterList    }}for (Record rec : masterList) {    boolean isObsolete = true;    for (Integer updId : updatedIds) {        if (rec.getId() == updId) { isObsolete = false; break; }    }    if (isObsolete) {        //TODO remove rec from masterList    }}The first loop takes care of requirement 1, the second takes care of requirement 2.

The returned array is a runtime representation of the list, and is independent of this list. The returned array's runtime type is that of the specified array. If the list fits in the specified array, it is returned therein. Otherwise, a new array is allocated with the runtime type of the specified array and the size of this list.\nQuestion: How can I convert a List to a Set in Java?\nPlease using this api: List.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: List.stream\n<<<code>>>: List<String> list = Arrays.asList(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\");\nSet<String> set = list.stream().collect(Collectors.toSet());\n<<<explanation>>>: The collect() method of the Stream interface returns a Collector that, when applied to a stream, produces the result described by this Collector.
