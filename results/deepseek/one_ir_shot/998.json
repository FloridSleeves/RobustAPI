We are about to listen!Connection Closed!where the empty line represents the non null data received over the course of the connection, ie that there is none.I expect this:Attempting to Establish ConnectionServer Online!We are about to listen!thump thumpthump thumpthump thump (and so on, every second)Connection closed!I spent time performing different tests by commenting out or changing the code slightly with the same testing format (except for the special case, which is number 6) and made these observations:ObservationsOnly when the socket is closed and the output stream is closed, does the program move past the offending line.When the readline() method starts to process (shortly before the heartbeat cuts it off) it detects nothing in the stream, not even THUMP_THUMP.When the socket is closed, but the output stream is not, the readline() method starts to process, only to detect nothing, heartbeat cuts it off. No SocketException even though it would be expected.If the socket is NOT closed, and only the output stream is closed, a SocketException is triggered, suggesting the socket is closed.I used netstat -an in command prompt, and when the server is started the port 1234 is LISTENING. When the client connects, it is still LISTENING, implying that there is no connection.I set up some python code to connect to itself over port 1234,however I made a mistake in the python code, and as such the serverdidn't close, and was still open. So I decided to connect the javaclient to the server and see what happens. I did this by runningClient(null) which is the client code for the non-host. Itresulted in the port reading ESTABLISHED, and the python server wasechoing back the \"thump thump\", and the java code was successfullyreading it. No hanging, it worked perfectly.This leads me to believe that the problem lies in the server code, as the python server was able to communicate sucessfully with the Java client, but the Java client is unable to communicate with the Java server.Before performing this testing I had been concentrating on the Client code, believing that it was at fault. All the questions I have found here with similar symptoms (see here, here and here, among others) have turned up blank for me, having written in their solutions (most were due to the output stream not flushing, or the \\n ommitted, which I have not failed to do, or the solution not fixing my problem, and so having been removed in favor of the heartbeat in this case). I originally based my code off of this article.After 4 days of trying to figure out this problem I am at a loss for what to do... What am I missing here? Why is the Server code not working as I expect it to? If anybody needs any more clarification on my code then please ask!As an after-note, the testing code is run through a simple minimalistic GUI written in javafx (not fxml though), whether that would be a problem or not I'm sure, I would think not, due to it working with the Python server.

No hanging, it worked perfectly.This leads me to believe that the problem lies in the server code, as the python server was able to communicate sucessfully with the Java client, but the Java client is unable to communicate with the Java server.Before performing this testing I had been concentrating on the Client code, believing that it was at fault. All the questions I have found here with similar symptoms (see here, here and here, among others) have turned up blank for me, having written in their solutions (most were due to the output stream not flushing, or the \\n ommitted, which I have not failed to do, or the solution not fixing my problem, and so having been removed in favor of the heartbeat in this case). I originally based my code off of this article.After 4 days of trying to figure out this problem I am at a loss for what to do... What am I missing here? Why is the Server code not working as I expect it to? If anybody needs any more clarification on my code then please ask!As an after-note, the testing code is run through a simple minimalistic GUI written in javafx (not fxml though), whether that would be a problem or not I'm sure, I would think not, due to it working with the Python server.
