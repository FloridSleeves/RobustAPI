For example: for range 1 to 100 I would like to select a random sample of 20%. This would result in 20 integers randomly selected for 100. This is to solve an extremely complex issue and I will post solutions once I get this and a few bugs worked out. I have not used many math packages in java so I appreciate your assistance.Thanks!\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.
