A field suppose 'name', which has maximum of 32 chars.  Most of the time 'name' field contains less than maximum limit.  Some unwanted chars (i think 'null') is filled with data. i used 'trim' method to remove, but nothing happened.  I need only valid data for processing, how can i solve this problem ?\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.
