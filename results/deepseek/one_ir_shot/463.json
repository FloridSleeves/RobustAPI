What would be the most efficient way of accomplishing this task?UPDATE.As you can see the desired order is not alphabetical, that includes reverse. As I mentioned the objective is to group the strings and order them by first appearance. For this example I am using letter to simplify a (lot) more complex problem I am trying to solve. The thing to concentrate with here is the order on which the letter of each string appear. Grouping in a specific order, rather than ordering.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.
