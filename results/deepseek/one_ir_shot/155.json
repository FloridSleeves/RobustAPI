If I dont call this method the command line isn't executed.I want to execute more than one command but I can't.Example:\"Call phone\" and then \"terminate\" to end the call whenever I want. But I can only insert the first command line and if I dont use the close() method the command line is not executed.Code:Start a process:ProcessBuilder builder = new ProcessBuilder(PROCESS);builder.redirectErrorStream(true);Process p = builder.start();Read the InputStream of Process:InputStream i = p.getInputStream();System.out.print((char)i.read());while(i.available() > 0){    System.out.print((char)i.read());}Insert command line into OutputStream:String command = com.nextLine();OutputStream o = p.getOutputStream();o.write(comando.getBytes());o.flush();o.close();If I delete \"o.close()\" the command line is not executed, but if I execute it I can't execute the other command lines.I tried the code on my program, but when I insert the command line I dont see the next information of the process.When I put your code :ReadyWarning: video is disabled in linphonec, use -V or -C or -D to enable.linphonec> Registration on sip:XX.XX.XX.XX successful.linphonec> call XXXExemple with my code:ReadyWarning: video is disabled in linphonec, use -V or -C or -D to enable.linphonec> Registration on sip:XX.XX.XX.XX successful.linphonec> call XXXEstablishing call id to sip:XXX@XX.XX.XX.XX, assigned id 1With \"Available > 0\" I get \"Establishing call id to sip:XXX@XX.XX.XX.XX, assigned id 1\".If I use this loop I dont see the other info of the process.I think the problem is that the outputstream does not get the command lines until I execute the Close method.Thank you.Sorry for my bad englando.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.
