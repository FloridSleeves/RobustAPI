This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to I find out the size of a GZIP section embedded in firmware?: :I am currently analyzing firmware images which contain many different sections, one of which is a GZIP section. I am able to know the location of the start of the GZIP section using magic number and the GZIPInputStream in Java. However, I need to know the compressed size of the gzip section. GZIPInputStream would return me the uncompressed file size.Is there anybody who has an idea? \nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.

It returns the total number of bytes read into the buffer, or -1 if there is no more data because the end of the stream has been reached. This is a non-blocking method. This is a potentially blocking operation.\nQuestion: How can I get the current date and time in Java?\nPlease using this api: LocalDateTime.now.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: LocalDateTime.now\n<<<code>>>: LocalDateTime currentDateTime = LocalDateTime.now();\n<<<explanation>>>: The now() method of the LocalDateTime class returns the current date-time using the system clock and the default time-zone. This is a static factory method.
