Is it possible to copy it somehow?I need to get a image from web, save it locally and then return the saved image. I just thought it would be faster to use the same stream instead of starting a new stream to the downloaded content and then read it again.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.

It returns the byte read as an int value in the range 0 to 255. If no byte is available because the end of the stream has been reached, the value -1 is returned. This is a blocking operation.\nQuestion: How to get the current date and time in Java?\nPlease using this api: LocalDateTime.now.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: LocalDateTime.now\n<<<code>>>: LocalDateTime now = LocalDateTime.now();\n<<<explanation>>>: The now() method of the LocalDateTime class returns the current date-time using the system clock and the default time-zone. This is a static factory method.\nQuestion: How to get the current date and time in Java?\nPlease using this api: LocalDateTime.now.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: LocalDateTime.now\n<<<code>>>: LocalDateTime now = LocalDateTime.now();\n<<<explanation>>>: The now() method of the LocalDateTime class returns the current date-time using the system clock and the default time-zone.
