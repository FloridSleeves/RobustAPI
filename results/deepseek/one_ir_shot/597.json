Maybe I'm going about this the wrong way, but let's see where this question goes :)I would like a Map container that contains either Strings or lists of Strings. I want to enforce this rule during construction of this object so that you can't create a map with values that aren't either of those.e.g.class Record {  public Record(String key, Map<String,Object> attrs) {    // check that attrs only contains Objects which are Strings or List<Strings>  }}Other ways I have thought of to solve the problem might be...1)class Record {  public Record(String key, Map<String,String> attrs, Map<String,List<String>> multiAttrs) {    // ...  }}2)class Record {  public Record(String key, Map<String,Value> attrs) {    // ...  }}class Value {  // Create some funky class that encapsulates lists.  // Perhaps returning the only element in the list if the size is 1,  // but returning the list otherwise}I am not immediately excited at the alternatives, but I'm just putting it there as stuff I've already considered. Really I want the distinction between Strings and List to be transparent to the user of the class.\nPlease using this api: List.get.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.
