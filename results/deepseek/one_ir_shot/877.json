The query() method takes the following parameters:\nTABLE_NAME: The name of the table to query.\nnull: The columns to return. If null, all columns are returned.\n\"id = ?\": The selection criteria. This is a WHERE clause that specifies which rows to return. In this case, it returns rows where the id column is equal to the value of the id parameter.\nnew String[]{id}: The selection arguments. This is an array of values that are used in the selection criteria. In this case, it is the value of the id parameter.\nnull: The group by clause. If null, no group by clause is used.\nnull: The having clause. If null, no having clause is used.\nnull: The order by clause. If null, no order by clause is used.\nThe Cursor object returned by the query() method can be used to iterate over the results of the query.
