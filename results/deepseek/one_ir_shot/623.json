Creating it takes about 50-55 seconds, so I decided to serialize it and save it to a file. Reading from the file takes about 16-17 seconds now.The only problem is that lookups seems to be slower this way. I always thought that the hashmap is read from the file into the memory, so the performance should be the same compared to the case when I create the hashmap myself, right? Here is the code I am using to read the hashmap into a file:File file = new File(\"omaha.ser\");FileInputStream f = new FileInputStream(file);ObjectInputStream s = new ObjectInputStream(new BufferedInputStream(f));omahaMap = (HashMap<Long, Integer>) s.readObject();s.close();300 million lookups take about 3.1 seconds when I create the hashmap myself, and about 8.5 seconds when I read the same hashmap from file.
