An attempt is made to read as many as len bytes, but a smaller number may be read. The number of bytes actually read is returned as an integer.\nQuestion: How to get the current time in milliseconds in Java?\nPlease using this api: System.currentTimeMillis.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: System.currentTimeMillis\n<<<code>>>: long currentTimeMillis = System.currentTimeMillis();\n<<<explanation>>>: The currentTimeMillis() method of the System class returns the current time in milliseconds.\nQuestion: How to get the current time in milliseconds in Java?\nPlease using this api: System.currentTimeMillis.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: System.currentTimeMillis\n<<<code>>>: long currentTimeMillis = System.currentTimeMillis();\n<<<explanation>>>: The currentTimeMillis() method of the System class returns the current time in milliseconds.\nQuestion: How to get the current time in milliseconds in Java?\nPlease using this api: System.currentTimeMillis.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: System.currentTimeMillis\n<<<code>>>: long currentTimeMillis = System.currentTimeMillis();\n<<<explanation>>>: The currentTimeMillis() method of the System class returns the current time in milliseconds.\nQuestion: How to get the current time in milliseconds in Java?\nPlease using this api: System.currentTimeMillis.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: System.currentTimeMillis\n<<<code>>>: long currentTimeMillis = System.currentTimeMillis();\n<<<explanation>>>: The currentTimeMillis() method of the System class returns the current time in milliseconds.\nQuestion: How to get the current time in milliseconds in Java?\nPlease using this api: System.currentTimeMillis.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: System.currentTimeMillis\n<<<code>>>: long currentTimeMillis = System.currentTimeMillis();\n<<<explanation>>>: The currentTimeMillis() method of the System class returns the current time in milliseconds.\nQuestion: How to get the current time in milliseconds in Java?\nPlease using this api: System.currentTimeMillis.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: System.currentTimeMillis\n<<<code>>>: long currentTimeMillis = System.currentTimeMillis();\n<<<explanation>>>: The currentTimeMillis() method of the System class returns the current time in milliseconds.\nQuestion: How to get the current time in milliseconds in Java?\nPlease using this api: System.currentTimeMillis.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: System.currentTimeMillis\n<<<code>>>: long currentTimeMillis = System.currentTimeMillis();\n<<<explanation>>>: The currentTimeMillis() method of the System class returns the current time in milliseconds.\nQuestion: How to get the current time in milliseconds in Java?\nPlease using this api: System.currentTimeMillis.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: System.currentTimeMillis\n<<<code>>>: long currentTimeMillis = System.currentTimeMillis();\n<<<explanation>>>: The currentTimeMillis() method of the System class returns the current time in milliseconds.\nQuestion: How to get the current time in milliseconds in Java?\nPlease using this api: System.currentTimeMillis.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: System.currentTimeMillis\n<<<code>>>: long currentTimeMillis = System.currentTimeMillis();\n<<<explanation>>>: The currentTimeMillis() method of the System class returns the current time in milliseconds.\nQuestion: How to get the current time in milliseconds in Java?\nPlease using this api: System.currentTimeMillis.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: System.currentTimeMillis\n<<<code>>>: long currentTimeMillis = System.currentTimeMillis();\n<<<explanation>>>: The currentTimeMillis()"}
