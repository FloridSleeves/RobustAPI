These objects graphs use Joda Time entities (DateTime, LocalTime etc).The top Google hit for \"gson joda\" is this page:https://sites.google.com/site/gson/gson-type-adapters-for-common-classesIt provides source for a type adapter for org.joda.time.DateTime.  This link is also what is referenced in the GSON User Guide.I expected to find a pre-rolled library that included joda-time serialisers that I could reference as a Maven dependency - but I can't find one.
