I'd like to take advantage of this feature.Here's the scenario.File FOO.BAR is 20 MB.  I'd split it into some arbitrary chunk size, let's say 1 MB, which means 20 chunks.   Chunks #3 and #14 fail (maybe the cellular/WiFi connection was bad).  I can now re-upload just these two chunks and everything will be good.What I'd like to know is how can I read only part of a file (like the data between 3MB and 4MB)?  The file piece should be an InputStream or File object.Thanks,Makoto\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.
