An attempt is made to read as many as len bytes, but a smaller number may be read. The number of bytes actually read is returned as an integer. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to convert a java.util.Date to a java.sql.Timestamp in java?: How can I convert a java.util.Date to a java.sql.Timestamp in java?\nPlease using this api: Timestamp.valueOf.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Timestamp.valueOf\n<<<code>>>: java.util.Date date = ...;\njava.sql.Timestamp timestamp = java.sql.Timestamp.valueOf(date.toInstant());\n<<<explanation>>>: The valueOf() method of the Timestamp class returns a Timestamp object that represents the same point on the time-line as this Timestamp object. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to convert a java.util.Date to a java.sql.Timestamp in java?: How can I convert a java.util.Date to a java.sql.Timestamp in java?\nPlease using this api: Timestamp.valueOf.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Timestamp.valueOf\n<<<code>>>: java.util.Date date = ...;\njava.sql.Timestamp timestamp = java.sql.Timestamp.valueOf(date.toInstant());\n<<<explanation>>>: The valueOf() method of the Timestamp class returns a Timestamp object that represents the same point on the time-line as this Timestamp object.
