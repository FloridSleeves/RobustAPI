The server is JBoss 5.1.0GA.This encrypted text is then sent to a JMS destination.On the receiving end of JMS there is a simple Java application which (using BouncyCastle) tries to decrypt the text. All this works like a charm on Windows.On Linux I get this:javax.crypto.IllegalBlockSizeException: last block incomplete in decryptionat org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.JCEBlockCipher.engineDoFinal(Unknown Source)at javax.crypto.Cipher.doFinal(DashoA13*..)I logged the Encrypted text when received by the Java app (encoded in Base64), and it is identical both on Linux and Windows. The key is obviously the same.I believed it could have been a charset encoding problem, but even starting both JBoss and the Java app with -Dfile.encoding=UTF8 or -Dfile.encoding=windows-1252 option didn't work.Here is the code used for encrypting (ActionScript):var keyData:ByteArray = Hex.toArray(Hex.fromString(\"jgd8f3m8ybjhwlGhr4hihbp0\"));var pinData:ByteArray = Hex.toArray(Hex.fromString(\"12341234\"));var pad:IPad = new PKCS5;var mode:ICipher = Crypto.getCipher(\"simple-3des-ecb\", keyData, pad);pad.setBlockSize(mode.getBlockSize());               mode.encrypt(pinData);var message:IMessage = new AsyncMessage();message.body = Base64.encodeByteArray(pinData);Here is the code used for decrypting (Java):String userPin3DESEncrypted = new String(Base64.decodeBase64(userPin3DESBase64Encrypted.getBytes()));byte [] keyByte = \"jgd8f3m8ybjhwlGhr4hihbp0\".getBytes();SecretKeySpec secretKeySpec = new SecretKeySpec(keyByte, \"DESEDE\");Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"DESEDE/ECB/PKCS5Padding\");cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, secretKeySpec);String userPinDecrypted = new String(cipher.doFinal(userPin3DESEncrypted.getBytes()));As previously said, the content of userPin3DESBase64Encrypted is the same (the same Base64 string) on both Linux and Windows, so the issue shouldn't be on Flex/JBoss side...Any ideas?Thanks in advance to all who are going to bang their head on the desk as I already did many times...CheersLuca\nPlease using this api: Cipher.init.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.
