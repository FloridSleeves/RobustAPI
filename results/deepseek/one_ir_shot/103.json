This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I normalize the EOL character in Java?: :I have a linux server and many clients with many operating systems. The server takes an input file from clients. Linux has end of line char LF, while Mac has end of line char CR, andWindows has end of line char CR+LFThe server needs as end of line char LF. Using java, I want to ensure that the file will always use the linux eol char LF.
