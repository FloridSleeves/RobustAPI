Perhaps storing the variables in an array? What I'd like to do, in case I'm faced with thousands of 2D arrays, is invoking the method with the value of a variable of a different data type, like this:String arrayToBeInvokedWith = \"array1\";method(arrayToBeInvokedWith){}(Yes, I do know this is too simplistic, but you can get the idea from it)Is there a similar solution?
