I currently have an iterator that starts at the head:public Iterator<E> iterator( ){    return new ListIterator();}All I have for the other one is:public Iterator<E> iterator(int x ){    return new ListIterator();}I'm not sure how to go about utilizing the given position(x) that won't affect my ListIterator constructor which starts at head. I tried using a for loop to get to \"x\" but realized that wouldn't tell the iterator to start there, so I'm quite stumped. Edit:public ListIterator()        {            current = head; // head in the enclosing list        }\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.

This method may be called repeatedly to iterate through the collection, or intermixed with calls to the remove() method to remove elements from the collection. This is a special case of a reduction.

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the minimum value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint min = Arrays.stream(array).min().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The min() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalInt describing the minimum element of this stream, or an empty OptionalInt if the stream is empty. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the average value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\ndouble average = Arrays.stream(array).average().getAsDouble();\n<<<explanation>>>: The average() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalDouble describing the arithmetic mean of elements of this stream, or an empty OptionalDouble if the stream is empty. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.
