This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I create a new array with the same elements as an existing array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.copyOf.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.copyOf\n<<<code>>>: int[] original = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint[] copy = Arrays.copyOf(original, original.length);\n<<<explanation>>>: The copyOf() method of the Arrays class returns a new array containing the same elements as the given array. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the maximum value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint max = Arrays.stream(array).max().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The max() method of the IntStream class returns the maximum value in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the minimum value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint min = Arrays.stream(array).min().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The min() method of the IntStream class returns the minimum value in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the average value of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\ndouble average = Arrays.stream(array).average().getAsDouble();\n<<<explanation>>>: The average() method of the IntStream class returns the average value of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the sum of the elements in an array that are greater than a given value in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).filter(x -> x > 3).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The filter() method of the IntStream class returns a stream consisting of the elements of this stream that match the given predicate. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the sum of the elements in an array that are less than a given value in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).filter(x -> x < 3).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The filter() method of the IntStream class returns a stream consisting of the elements of this stream that match the given predicate. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the sum of the elements in an array that are greater than a given value and less than a given value in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).filter(x -> x > 3 && x < 5).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>"}
