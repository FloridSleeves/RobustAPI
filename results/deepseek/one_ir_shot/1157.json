This returns data split by \u00a7. In eclipse, when run as an application, the code works fine. The issue is when I bring it to Android. I have done some research on this but haven't been able to find a working solution.

This is what happens in eclipse. In android, I get a 1-long String[] with the value \"Look like this\u00a70\u00a725\".
