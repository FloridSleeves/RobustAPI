Because you can't have two methods with the same signature (Our compiler thinks Integer sum(Iterable<Integer>) has the same signature as Double sum(Iterable<Double>).)

What can I do here? I know in C++ you can overload operators, but not in Java. But every class which extends Number does overload the += operator.
