Thanks in advance.Here is the sending server-thread codetry{       out.println(\"AcceptFile,\");    FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(fn);    byte[] buffer = new byte[fis.available()];    fis.read(buffer);    ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream()) ;    oos.writeObject(buffer);    oos.flush();}catch(Exception c){    System.err.println(\"exc\" + c);}Here is the Client-thread receivingtry{    ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(socket.getInputStream());                    byte[] buffer = (byte[])ois.readObject();                    String pic=\"copy\"+studId+\".pdf\";                    System.out.println(pic);                    FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(pic);                    fos.write(buffer);                      fos.flush();                    fos.close();    }catch(Exception e){    System.out.println(\"Exception writing\");}\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.
