It returns the number of bytes actually read. If the end of the stream is reached, it returns -1. This is a blocking operation. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to get the current date and time in Java?\nPlease using this api: Calendar.getInstance.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Calendar.getInstance\n<<<code>>>: Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();\nint year = calendar.get(Calendar.YEAR);\nint month = calendar.get(Calendar.MONTH);\nint day = calendar.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH);\nint hour = calendar.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY);\nint minute = calendar.get(Calendar.MINUTE);\nint second = calendar.get(Calendar.SECOND);\n<<<explanation>>>: The getInstance() method of the Calendar class returns a Calendar object representing the current date and time. This is a static factory method. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to get the current date and time in Java?\nPlease using this api: System.currentTimeMillis.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: System.currentTimeMillis\n<<<code>>>: long currentTimeMillis = System.currentTimeMillis();\n<<<explanation>>>: The currentTimeMillis() method of the System class returns the current time in milliseconds. This is a static factory method. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to get the current date and time in Java?\nPlease using this api: java.time.LocalDateTime.now.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: java.time.LocalDateTime.now\n<<<code>>>: LocalDateTime now = LocalDateTime.now();\n<<<explanation>>>: The now() method of the LocalDateTime class returns the current date and time. This is a static factory method. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to get the current date and time in Java?\nPlease using this api: java.time.ZonedDateTime.now.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: java.time.ZonedDateTime.now\n<<<code>>>: ZonedDateTime now = ZonedDateTime.now();\n<<<explanation>>>: The now() method of the ZonedDateTime class returns the current date and time. This is a static factory method. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to get the current date and time in Java?\nPlease using this api: java.time.OffsetDateTime.now.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: java.time.OffsetDateTime.now\n<<<code>>>: OffsetDateTime now = OffsetDateTime.now();\n<<<explanation>>>: The now() method of the OffsetDateTime class returns the current date and time. This is a static factory method. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to get the current date and time in Java?\nPlease using this api: java.time.Instant.now.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: java.time.Instant.now\n<<<code>>>: Instant now = Instant.now();\n<<<explanation>>>: The now() method of the Instant class returns the current date and time. This is a static factory method. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to get the current date and time in Java?\nPlease using this api: java.time.OffsetTime.now.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: java.time.OffsetTime.now\n<<<code>>>: OffsetTime now = OffsetTime.now();\n<<<explanation>>>: The now() method of the OffsetTime class returns the current date and time. This is a static factory method. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to get the current date and time in Java?\nPlease using this api: java.time.LocalTime.now.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: java.time.LocalTime.now\n<<<code>>>: LocalTime now = LocalTime.now();\n<<<explanation>>>: The now() method of the LocalTime class returns the"}
