This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I convert a List to a Map in Java?\nPlease using this api: Collectors.toMap.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Collectors.toMap\n<<<code>>>: List<A> list = ...;\nMap<A,B> map = list.stream().collect(Collectors.toMap(A::getKey, A::getValue));\n<<<explanation>>>: The toMap() method of the Collectors class returns a Collector that accumulates elements into a Map whose keys and values are the result of applying the provided mapping functions to the input elements. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I convert a Map to a List in Java?\nPlease using this api: Map.entrySet.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Map.entrySet\n<<<code>>>: Map<A,B> map = ...;\nList<A> list = map.entrySet().stream().map(Map.Entry::getKey).collect(Collectors.toList());\n<<<explanation>>>: The entrySet() method of the Map interface returns a Set view of the mappings contained in this map. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I convert a List to a Set in Java?\nPlease using this api: Collectors.toSet.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Collectors.toSet\n<<<code>>>: List<A> list = ...;\nSet<A> set = list.stream().collect(Collectors.toSet());\n<<<explanation>>>: The toSet() method of the Collectors class returns a Collector that accumulates elements into a Set. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I convert a Set to a List in Java?\nPlease using this api: ArrayList.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: ArrayList\n<<<code>>>: Set<A> set = ...;\nList<A> list = new ArrayList<>(set);\n<<<explanation>>>: The ArrayList(Collection<? extends E> c) constructor of the ArrayList class creates a list backed by the specified collection, in the order that it iterates over that collection. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I convert a Set to a Map in Java?\nPlease using this api: Collectors.toMap.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Collectors.toMap\n<<<code>>>: Set<A> set = ...;\nMap<A,B> map = set.stream().collect(Collectors.toMap(A::getKey, A::getValue));\n<<<explanation>>>: The toMap() method of the Collectors class returns a Collector that accumulates elements into a Map whose keys and values are the result of applying the provided mapping functions to the input elements.
