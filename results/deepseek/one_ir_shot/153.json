{"api": "InputStream.read", "prompt": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Progressbar of a bin file loading: :how can I show a JProgressBar component like on the loading of a bin file?I can only found solutions for iterative bin read and I'm using an object reading like:CustomObj test = (CustomObj) in.readObject();Cheers\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.

The number of bytes read is returned. If the end of the stream is reached, -1 is returned. This is a blocking operation. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I get the current time in Java?\nPlease using this api: Instant.now.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Instant.now\n<<<code>>>: Instant now = Instant.now();\n<<<explanation>>>: The now() method of the Instant class returns the current time as an Instant. This is a non-blocking operation. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I get the current date in Java?\nPlease using this api: LocalDate.now.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: LocalDate.now\n<<<code>>>: LocalDate today = LocalDate.now();\n<<<explanation>>>: The now() method of the LocalDate class returns the current date as a LocalDate. This is a non-blocking operation. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I get the current time in Java?\nPlease using this api: LocalTime.now.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: LocalTime.now\n<<<code>>>: LocalTime now = LocalTime.now();\n<<<explanation>>>: The now() method of the LocalTime class returns the current time as a LocalTime. This is a non-blocking operation. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I get the current date and time in Java?\nPlease using this api: LocalDateTime.now.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: LocalDateTime.now\n<<<code>>>: LocalDateTime now = LocalDateTime.now();\n<<<explanation>>>: The now() method of the LocalDateTime class returns the current date and time as a LocalDateTime. This is a non-blocking operation. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I get the current date and time in Java?\nPlease using this api: ZonedDateTime.now.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: ZonedDateTime.now\n<<<code>>>: ZonedDateTime now = ZonedDateTime.now();\n<<<explanation>>>: The now() method of the ZonedDateTime class returns the current date and time as a ZonedDateTime. This is a non-blocking operation. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I get the current date and time in Java?\nPlease using this api: OffsetDateTime.now.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: OffsetDateTime.now\n<<<code>>>: OffsetDateTime now = OffsetDateTime.now();\n<<<explanation>>>: The now() method of the OffsetDateTime class returns the current date and time as an OffsetDateTime. This is a non-blocking operation. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I get the current date and time in Java?\nPlease using this api: OffsetTime.now.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: OffsetTime.now\n<<<code>>>: OffsetTime now = OffsetTime.now();\n<<<explanation>>>: The now() method of the OffsetTime class returns the current time as an OffsetTime. This is a non-blocking operation. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I get the current date and time in Java?\nPlease using this api: Instant.now.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Instant.now\n<<<code>>>: Instant now = Instant.now();\n<<<explanation>>>: The now() method of the Instant class returns the current time as an Instant.
