The problem with this implementation would be, that handleInput() is called with every byte read from in.read(). I know, that i could use BufferedReader.readLine(), but that would require every incomming command to have \"\\n\" appended to it, which is NOT the case and can't be changed. I know that         while (!isInterrupted()) {            while ((data = in.read()) != -1 && !isInterrupted()) { is kind of nuisance, but basically it want the Thread to read until nothing new is read, then handle that input and then read again...EDIT:So basically, what i need is a non-blocking read().EDIT2:How can incoming commands and commandchains look like:Select Command: \"s\"ReadLine Command: \"rlXX\" whereby X is a Hex DigitWriteLine Command: \"wlXXSSSSSSSS\" whereby X and S are Hex DigitsSo a commandschain may look like one of the following:\"s\"\"srlff\" = \"s\" + \"rlff\"\"rlffwlbb2e2e2e2erlbb\" = \"s\" + \"rlff\" + \"wlbb2e2e2e2e\" + \"rlbb\"\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.
