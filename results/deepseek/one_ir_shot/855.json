The format has a Header comprised of a three-char description, a dummy byte, plus a byte indicating the number of files. Then each file has an entry consisting of a dummy byte, a twelve-char string describing the file name, a dummy byte, and an offset declared in a three-byte array. What would be the proper class for reading this kind of structure? I have tried RandomAccessFile but it does not allow to read arrays of data, e.g. I can only read three chars by calling readChar() three times, etc.Of course I can extend RandomAccessFile to do what I want but there's got to be a proper out-of-the-box class to do this kind of processing isn't it?This is my reader for the header in C#:protected override void ReadHeader(){    Header = new string(this.BinaryReader.ReadChars(3));    byte dummy = this.BinaryReader.ReadByte();    NFiles = this.BinaryReader.ReadByte();}\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.

An attempt is made to read len bytes, but a smaller number may be read, possibly zero. The file pointer is advanced by the number of bytes actually read. This is a potentially blocking operation.
