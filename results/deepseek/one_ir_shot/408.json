This method may be called repeatedly to iterate through the set of elements returned by the iterator, or to access the current element after it has already been returned by a call to next(). This method may be called only once per call to next(), the first time it is called and after a call to remove(), or may be called to access the element that will be returned by a subsequent call to next() if it exists. This method may be called only if hasNext() returns true.\nQuestion: How can I find the maximum value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint max = Arrays.stream(array).max().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The max() method of the IntStream class returns the maximum element in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the minimum value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint min = Arrays.stream(array).min().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The min() method of the IntStream class returns the minimum element in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the average value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\ndouble avg = Arrays.stream(array).average().getAsDouble();\n<<<explanation>>>: The average() method of the IntStream class returns the average of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the sum of the squares of the elements in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).map(x -> x * x).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The map() method of the IntStream class returns a stream consisting of the results of applying the given function to the elements of this stream. This is an intermediate operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the product of the elements in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint product = Arrays.stream(array).reduce(1, (x, y) -> x * y);\n<<<explanation>>>: The reduce() method of the IntStream class returns the reduced value of this stream according to the provided identity value and an associative accumulation function. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the sum of the elements in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.
