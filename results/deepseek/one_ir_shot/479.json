Here is my current (not so good) way of doing it (just so you know what I am trying to do).    List<Double> list1 = ... // init here    List<Double> list2 = ... // init here    Function<Double, Double, Double> myFunc = ... // init here    List<Double> ret = new ArrayList<Double>(size);    for (int n = 0; n < size; ++n)    {        ret.add(func.apply(list1.get(n),                           list2.get(n)));    }    return ret;interface Function <X, Y, Z>{    Z apply(X arg1, Y arg2);}Is there some existing helpers that would allow me to do something like:Lists.combine(list1, list2, myFunction);For instance, suppose I have two list of integers, and I have the function f(x, y) = x * y)I want the resulting list to be a list of  (x[i] * y[i])Concretely, list1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}list2 = {2, 3, 4, 4}result = {2, 6, 12, 15}Thanks\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.
