This method may be called repeatedly to iterate through the collection, or intermixed with calls to the remove() method to remove elements from the collection. (If the collection object implements the remove() method, it must support element removal.) \n\nA: The problem is that the iterator returned by entrySet() is not a fail-fast iterator.\nFrom the documentation:\n\nNote that the set returned by this method is backed by the map, so\n  changes to the map are reflected in the set, and vice-versa. If the\n  map is modified while an iteration over the set is in progress\n  (except through the iterator's own remove operation), the results of\n  the iteration are undefined. The set supports element removal, which\n  removes the corresponding mapping from the map, via the Iterator.remove,\n  Set.remove, removeAll, retainAll and clear operations. It does not\n  support the add or addAll operations.\n\nSo, if you call addAll() on the returned set, you're going to get a ConcurrentModificationException.\n"}
