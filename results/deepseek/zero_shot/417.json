The code snippet is not complete and does not include the necessary import statements for the classes used.\nThe code snippet is missing the following import statements:\nimport lotus.domino.Database;\nimport lotus.domino.Document;\nimport lotus.domino.DocumentCollection;\nimport lotus.domino.RichTextItem;\n\nThe code snippet is also missing the necessary code to open the Lotus Notes database and retrieve the document collection containing the attachments.\nThe code snippet is also missing the necessary code to retrieve the attachments from the document.\nThe code snippet is also missing the necessary code to iterate through the attachments and print the names of the attachments.\nThe code snippet is also missing the necessary code to close the Lotus Notes database.\nPlease provide the necessary import statements and code to open the Lotus Notes database, retrieve the document collection containing the attachments, retrieve the attachments from the document, iterate through the attachments and print the names of the attachments, and close the Lotus Notes database.\nPlease provide the necessary import statements and code to open the Lotus Notes
