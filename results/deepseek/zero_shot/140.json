If multiple threads call write method at the same time, the output will be mixed.\nTo make it thread safe, you can synchronize the write method:\npublic synchronized void write(String message) {\n    bb.clear();\n    bb.put(message.getBytes());\n    bb.flip();\n    try {\n        fc.write(bb);\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    }\n}\n"}
