The best way to get a random element from a Collection is to use the Collection.toArray() method. This method returns an array containing all of the elements in the Collection. Then, you can use the Random.nextInt() method to get a random index into the array. Finally, you can use the array index operator ([]) to get the element at that index.\nHere's an example of how you could use the Collection.toArray() method to get a random element from a Collection:\nCollection<Integer> c = new HashSet<Integer>();\nRandom r = new Random();\nfor (int i = 0; i < 100000; i++){\n    c.add(r.nextInt());\n}\nObject[] arr = c.toArray();\nint randomIndex = r.nextInt(arr.length);\nint randomElement = (int) arr[randomIndex];\nSystem.out.println(randomElement);\nThis code will get a random element from the Collection c and print it to the console.\n"}
