It takes an integer argument b which is the byte to be written. The method first checks if the argument is a valid byte (i.e., between 0 and 255) and throws an IllegalArgumentException if it is not. It then calls the ensureOpen method to ensure that the output stream is open. If the output stream is open, the write method writes the byte to the output stream using the write method of the underlying OutputStream object. The count variable is incremented by 1 to keep track of the number of bytes written to the output stream.\nQuestion: How to generate ssh compatible id_rsa(.pub) from Java: :I'm looking for a way to programmatically create ssh compatible id_rsa and id_rsa.pub files in Java.
