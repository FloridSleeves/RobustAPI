It will return -1 if there is no data to read.\nSo the while loop will run until the InputStream is closed.\nThe handleInput() method will be called with every byte read from the InputStream.\nThe sleep() method will sleep for 500 milliseconds.\nThe isInterrupted() method will return true if the Thread is interrupted.\nThe socket.close() method will close the socket.\nThe main.log() method will log the message to the console.\nThe main.stopBTCommunication() method will stop the Bluetooth communication.\nThe main.startBTServer() method will start the Bluetooth server.\n\nA: I think you are looking for the readLine() method of the BufferedReader class.\n"}
