It takes two parameters, the string to be tokenized and the delimiter. The delimiter is the character or string that separates the tokens. In this case, the delimiter is the comma.\nThe nextToken() method is used to get the next token from the string. In this case, the first token is \"A\". The hasMoreTokens() method is used to check if there are more tokens in the string. In this case, there are two more tokens, so the loop continues. The next token is \"B\". The loop continues until there are no more tokens.\nThe lastToken variable is used to store the last token. In this case, the last token is \"C\".\n<<<code>>>:\nStringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(\"A,B,C\", \",\");\nString lastToken = st.nextToken();\nwhile (st.hasMoreTokens()) {\n    lastToken = st.nextToken();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>:\nThe StringTokenizer class is used to break a string into tokens.
