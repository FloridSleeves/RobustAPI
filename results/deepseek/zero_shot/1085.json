It is a legacy class that is not recommended for new development. Instead, consider using the split method of the String class or the java.util.regex package.\nQuestion: How to get the current date and time in Java? :I am looking for a java library which can inline an external CSS file with a HTML document based on its ID/class attributes.I've found jStyleParser but I am not sure if this is the right library for me.

The documentation and examples is not what I expected.Is there anyone who can answer that question or does there exist another library for this?Thanks\nAnswer: You can use the java.time package to get the current date and time in Java. Here is an example:\nimport java.time.LocalDateTime;\n\npublic class CurrentDateTime {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        LocalDateTime currentDateTime = LocalDateTime.now();\n        System.out.println(\"Current date and time: \" + currentDateTime);\n    }\n}\n\nQuestion: How to get the current date and time in Java? :I am looking for a java library which can inline an external CSS file with a HTML document based on its ID/class attributes.I've found jStyleParser but I am not sure if this is the right library for me.
