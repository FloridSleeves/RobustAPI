A token is a sequence of characters that are delimited by a delimiter. The StringTokenizer class provides methods to iterate through the tokens and to retrieve them.\nThe StringTokenizer class has two constructors:\nStringTokenizer(String str)\nStringTokenizer(String str, String delim)\nThe first constructor takes a string as input and uses the default delimiter, which is a space character. The second constructor takes a string and a delimiter as input. The delimiter is used to determine where the tokens are.\nThe StringTokenizer class has the following methods:\nboolean hasMoreTokens()\nReturns true if there are more tokens in the string.\nString nextToken()\nReturns the next token in the string.\nThe StringTokenizer class is used in a while loop to iterate through the tokens. The hasMoreTokens() method is used to check if there are more tokens in the string. The nextToken() method is used to retrieve the next token in the string.\nThe code above uses a StringTokenizer to iterate through the tokens in the string. The tokens are stored in the token variable. The do something with token is a placeholder for the code that you want to execute on each token.\n"}
