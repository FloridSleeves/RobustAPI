If you want to get the first element of a list, you can use List.get(int index) or List.get(int index).  If you want to get the first element of a set, you can use Set.iterator().next().\n\nA: You can use List.get(int index) to get the first element of a list.\nYou can use Set.iterator().next() to get the first element of a set.\n"}
