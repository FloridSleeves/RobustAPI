The DoublyLinkedList class has three private fields: head, tail, and size. The head field is a reference to the first node in the list, the tail field is a reference to the last node in the list, and the size field is an integer that keeps track of the number of nodes in the list.\nThe DoublyLinkedList class has a constructor that initializes the head, tail, and size fields to null and 0, respectively.\nThe DoublyLinkedList class has a public method called add that takes an element of type E as a parameter and adds a new node to the end of the list. The new node is created using the Node class, which has three fields: data, prev, and next. The data field is set to the value of the parameter, the prev field is set to null, and the next field is set to null. If the list is empty, the new node is set as both the head and tail of the list. Otherwise, the new node is added to the end of the list by setting its prev field to the current tail of the list, and its next field to null. The tail field is then updated to point to the new node. The size field is incremented by 1.\nThe DoublyLinkedList class has a public method called get that takes an integer index as a parameter and returns the element at the specified index in the list. If the index is less than 0 or greater than or equal to the size of the list, an IndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown. Otherwise, the method traverses the list from the head to the tail, and returns the data field of the node at the specified index.\nThe DoublyLinkedList class has a public method called remove that takes an integer index as a parameter and removes the node at the specified index from the list. If the index is less than 0 or greater than or equal to the size of the list, an IndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown. Otherwise, the method traverses the list"}
