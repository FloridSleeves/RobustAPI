Actual efficiency of the string matching algorithm is secondary but obviously, it would be nice to find a solution that used one of the more efficient of those algorithms.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Efficient way to search a stream for a string: :Let's suppose that have a stream of text (or Reader in Java) that I'd like to check for a particular string.

It then iterates over the buffer and checks each character against the search string. If the character matches the next character in the search string, the search string index is incremented. If the search string index reaches the length of the search string, the search string has been found and the method returns true. If the character does not match the next character in the search string, the search string index is reset to 0. The method continues to read data from the input stream into the buffer until the end of the stream is reached or the search string is found.\n"}
