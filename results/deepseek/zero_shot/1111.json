A token is a sequence of characters that are delimited by the delimiters. The StringTokenizer class is a legacy class that is retained for compatibility reasons although its use is discouraged in new code. It is recommended that anyone seeking this functionality use the split method of String or the java.util.regex package instead.\n\nA: I think you are looking for the split method of the String class.\nString str = \"123|apple|apple|apple|dog$\";\nString[] tokens = str.split(\"\\\\|\");\n\n"}
