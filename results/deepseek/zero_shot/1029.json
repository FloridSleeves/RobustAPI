If they don't match, the web service will return an error.\nIf you mean that you want to make your web service secure such that only your application and your application's users can call it, then you can do that by using a token in the URL.\nFor example, if you have a web service at http://www.example.com/api/getdata, you can make it secure by adding a token to the URL, like this: http://www.example.com/api/getdata?token=abc123.\nThen, when your application calls the web service, it will include the token in the URL, and the web service will check that the token matches the one you specified. If it doesn't match, the web service will return an error.\nIf you mean that you want to make your web service secure such that only your application and your application's users can call it, and you want to make it so that your application can call the web service without having to include the token in the URL, then you can do that by using a token in the URL and a header in the request.\nFor example, if you have a web service at http://www.example.com/api/getdata, you can make it secure by adding a token to the URL and a header to the request, like this:\nURL: http://www.example.com/api/getdata?token=abc123\nRequest:\nGET /api/getdata?token=abc123 HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.example.com\nAuthorization: Bearer abc123\n\nThen, when your application calls the web service, it will include the token in the URL and the header in the request, and the web service will check that the token matches the one you specified and that the header matches the one you specified. If either of these checks fail, the web service will return an error.\n"}
