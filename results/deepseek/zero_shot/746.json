String abc here in the code is coming from a textarea in html and I have the above code in my servlet. I am not able to understand why it won't write the string with spaces to file. I think it should. I have also checked by printing the String abc and it does print the string \"a b c\" (with spaces). But it won't print that to file. Is there a problem with my code? Any help would be appreciated.Thanks in advance.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Unusual outcome while writing to file: :I am having trouble while writing to file using the PrintWriter.

You should use PrintWriter.write(abc) instead.\n"}
