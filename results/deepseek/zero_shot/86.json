The class provides methods for writing primitive data types to the output stream.\n\nThe writeUTF(String str) method writes a string to the output stream. The string is encoded into a sequence of bytes using the modified UTF-8 encoding. The length of the string is written as a 16-bit integer.\n\nThe flush() method flushes the output stream.\n\nThe close() method closes the output stream.\n\nThe Socket class represents a socket connection to a remote host. The constructor takes the host name and the port number as arguments.\n\nThe getOutputStream() method returns an OutputStream object that can be used to write data to the socket.\n\nThe writeUTF(String str) method writes a string to the output stream.
