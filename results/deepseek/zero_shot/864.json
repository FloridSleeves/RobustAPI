Unfortunately, cryptography is not my strong side. Now I can write to file several messages and then close file. Then i can open it, append some messages, close again and after decryption I see padding bytes in the middle of file. Is there any way to work with encrypted file without having to decrypt it every time I want to append some messages?EDIT: little more details. Current implementation utlizes CipherOutputStream. As i understand there's no way to seek using it.Can i use 'NoPadding' option if i will control that output data size is divisible by block size?\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to append to AES encrypted file: :I'm writing some kind of logger that produces encrypted log-file.

You can't seek in a CipherOutputStream.  You can only read from it.  If you want to write to it, you have to write to a byte array, then encrypt the byte array, then write the encrypted bytes to the stream.\n"}
