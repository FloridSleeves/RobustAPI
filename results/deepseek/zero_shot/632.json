The comparator is a class that implements the Comparator interface. The compare method takes two objects and returns an integer. The integer is negative if the first object is less than the second object, positive if the first object is greater than the second object, and zero if the objects are equal.\n\n\nA: You can use the following code to sort the list based on the number:\nCollections.sort(list, new Comparator<HashMap<String, String>>() {\n\n    @Override\n    public int compare(HashMap<String, String> lhs,\n            HashMap<String, String> rhs) {\n        return Integer.parseInt(lhs.get(\"number\")) - Integer.parseInt(rhs.get(\"number\"));\n    }\n});\n\n\nA: You can use the following code to sort the list based on the number:\nCollections.sort(list, new Comparator<HashMap<String, String>>() {\n\n    @Override\n    public int compare(HashMap<String, String> lhs,\n            HashMap<String, String> rhs) {\n        return Integer.parseInt(lhs.get(\"number\")) - Integer.parseInt(rhs.get(\"number\"));\n    }\n});\n\n"}
