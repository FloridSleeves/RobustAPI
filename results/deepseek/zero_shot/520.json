The method uses an Iterator<?> to iterate over the elements of the Set<?>. The Iterator<?> is obtained from the Set<?> using the iterator() method. The method then uses a StringBuilder to build the string representation of the Set<?>. The method appends each element of the Set<?> to the StringBuilder, separated by the delimiter. The method returns the String representation of the Set<?>.\n\n\nA: You can use a StringJoiner to do this.\npublic static String setToString(Set<?> set, String delimiter) {\n    StringJoiner joiner = new StringJoiner(delimiter);\n    for (Object o : set) {\n        joiner.add(o.toString());\n    }\n    return joiner.toString();\n}\n\n"}
