The constructor of the StringTokenizer class takes two parameters: the string to be tokenized and the delimiter. The delimiter is the character or string that separates the tokens. In this case, the delimiter is \"|\". The nextToken() method returns the next token in the string. In this case, the first token is \"0\".\n"}
