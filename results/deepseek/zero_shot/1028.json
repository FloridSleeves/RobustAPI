The tokens go to an ArrayList, and the delimiters go to another.

Now, I need to store the original indices of these as well, so that the tokens would have indices 0, 2, 4 and 6 and the deliminators would have indices 1, 3 and 5. The normal solution would be to put them into the same array, but I need to keep them separated for performance reasons (e.g. to quickly check through the delimiters).How could this indexing be done so that when I have a token index 'i', I could easily get the deliminator from index 'i+1' without looping through all the delimiters?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Using the same indices between two arrays to get relevant information?: :I have a data reader that tokenizes input strings by given delimiters.

We can use this method to iterate through the tokens and delimiters in the string. We can use a while loop to iterate through the tokens and delimiters and store them in the corresponding arrays. We can use the countTokens() method to get the number of tokens in the string. We can use the hasMoreTokens() method to check if there are more tokens in the string.\n"}
