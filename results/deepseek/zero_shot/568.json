The RandomIterator class implements the Iterator interface and provides the next() method to return a random element from the collection. The hasNext() method returns true if there are still elements in the collection to be iterated over, and the remove() method is not supported.\n\nQuestion: Collection for fast add, get and remove random element: :Not a big question really.
