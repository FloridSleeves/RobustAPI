The iterator is not aware of the changes you are making to the array.\n\nA: The first example is not working because you are using the iterator to iterate over the array and you are trying to change the value of the array. The iterator is not aware of the changes you are making to the array.\nThe second example is working because you are using the index of the array to change the value of the array. The index is aware of the changes you are making to the array.\n"}
