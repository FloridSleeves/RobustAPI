Then, read the first file line by line and check if the ID is in the HashSet. If the ID is not in the HashSet, write it to the output file.\nHere is some sample code:\nimport java.io.BufferedReader;\nimport java.io.FileReader;\nimport java.io.FileWriter;\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.util.HashSet;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Read the IDs from the second file into a HashSet\n        HashSet<Long> ids = new HashSet<>();\n        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"C://DIDs.txt\"))) {\n            String line;\n            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n                ids.add(Long.parseLong(line));\n            }\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n\n        // Read the first file line by line and write the IDs that are not in the HashSet to the output file\n        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"C://AllIDs.txt\"));\n             FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(\"C://MBD.txt\")) {\n            String line;\n            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n                long id = Long.parseLong(line);\n                if (!ids.contains(id)) {\n                    fw.write(line + \"\\n\");\n                }\n            }\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n"}
