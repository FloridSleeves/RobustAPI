If this code is ok, how could I check if the executable indeed return values? \nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: int read() throws IOException\n<<<explanation>>>: Reads the next byte of data from the input stream. The value byte is returned as an int in the range 0 to 255. If no byte is available because the end of the stream has been reached, the value -1 is returned. This method blocks until input data is available, the end of the stream is detected, or an exception is thrown.\n\nA: I think you are not reading the output of the process.\nYou need to read the output of the process.\nInputStream in = process.getInputStream();\n\nwhile (in.available() > 0) {\n    System.out.print((char)in.read());\n}\n\n"}
