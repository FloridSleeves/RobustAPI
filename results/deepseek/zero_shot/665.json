Behavior of Java sockets when closing output stream: :Can someone explain the following behavior in Java sockets:The general idea is this:Open socket, Obtain I/O streams.Write request, Close out

miserably.Instead if I directly use the socket's shutdownOutput() method, it correctly closes the output stream channel, while keeping the socket alive.Why would closing the PrintWriter object take the whole socket down with it?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>:
