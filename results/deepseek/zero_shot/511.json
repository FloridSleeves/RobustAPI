Here's a quick sketch of the situation.I have a class Backpack that has a Hashmap content with as keys a variable of type long, and as value an ArrayList with Items. I have to write an Enumeration that iterates over the content of a Backpack. But here's the catch: in a Backpack, there can also be another Backpack. And the Enumeration should also be able to iterate over the content of a backpack that is in the backpack. (I hope you can follow, I'm not really good at explaining..)Here is the code I have:public Enumeration<Object> getEnumeration() {    return new Enumeration<Object>() {        private int itemsDone = 0;        //I make a new array with all the values of the HashMap, so I can use        //them in nextElement()        Collection<Long> keysCollection = getContent().keySet();                    Long [] keys = keysCollection.toArray(new Long[keysCollection.size()]);        public boolean hasMoreElements() {            if(itemsDone < getContent().size()) {                return true;            }else {                return false;            }        }        public Object nextElement() {                           ArrayList<Item> temporaryList= getContent().get(keys[itemsDone]);            for(int i = 0; i < temporaryList.size(); i++) {                if(temporaryList.get(i) instanceof Backpack) {                    return temporaryList.get(i).getEnumeration();                                       }else {                    return getContent().get(keys[itemsDone++]);                }            }        }    };Will this code work decently? It's just the \"return temporaryList.get(i).getEnumeration();\" I'm worried about. Will the users still be able to use just the hasMoreElemens() and nextElement() like he would normally do?Any help is appreciated,Harm De Weirdt\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Recursive Enumeration in Java: :I still have a question about Enumerations.

The hasMoreElements() method should return true if there are more elements to iterate over, and the nextElement() method should return the next element.\nIf you mean you have to write an Enumeration that iterates over the content of a Backpack, and the content of the Backpack can also be a Backpack, then you can do that by implementing the Enumeration interface and providing implementations for the hasMoreElements() and nextElement() methods.  The hasMoreElements() method should return true if there are more elements to iterate over, and the nextElement() method should return the next element.  If the next element is a Backpack, then you can call the getEnumeration() method on the Backpack to get an Enumeration for the content of the Backpack.  You can then use the hasMoreElements() and nextElement() methods of the Enumeration returned by the getEnumeration() method to iterate over the content of the Backpack.\n"}
