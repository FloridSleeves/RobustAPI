using StringTokenizer class to find the total number of white spaces in the given string.\nStringTokenizer class is used to break the string into tokens.\nThe constructor of StringTokenizer class takes two arguments, the first argument is the string to be tokenized and the second argument is the delimiter.\nThe delimiter is used to determine where the string should be broken into tokens.\nThe delimiter can be a single character or a string of characters.\nThe delimiter is used to determine where the string should be broken into tokens.\nThe delimiter can be a single character or a string of characters.\nThe delimiter is used to determine where the string should be broken into tokens.\nThe delimiter can be a single character or a string of characters.\nThe delimiter is used to
