The tokens are used to parse the string. The tokens may be separated by whitespace, or by any delimiter specified.\nThe nextToken() method returns the next token from the string.\nThe hasMoreTokens() method returns true if there are more tokens in the string.\nThe countTokens() method returns the number of tokens in the string.\nThe StringTokenizer class is a legacy class that is not recommended for new development. It is recommended to use the java.util.StringTokenizer class instead.\n"}
