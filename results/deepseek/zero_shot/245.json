The DataInputStream class provides methods to read primitive data and Strings in a machine-independent way.\n\n\nA: I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but you can use the following code to convert a boolean array to a string and vice versa:\npublic static String booleanArrayToString(boolean[] array) {\n    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n    for (boolean b : array) {\n        sb.append(b ? \"1\" : \"0\");\n    }\n    return sb.toString();\n}\n\npublic static boolean[] stringToBooleanArray(String str) {\n    boolean[] array = new boolean[str.length()];\n    for (int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++) {\n        array[i] = str.charAt(i) == '1';\n    }\n    return array;\n}\n\n"}
