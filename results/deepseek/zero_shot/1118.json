In this case, we are splitting the textarea element's text into lines. The \"\\n\" argument is used to specify the delimiter, which is the newline character.\nThe while loop iterates through the tokens, and the line variable is assigned the current token. We can then do something with the line variable, such as adding it to a list or printing it to the console.\n"}
