I have a problem how I read file and save elements to array and how implement this loop. This is my try with reading txt file and saving elements to array:    List<String[]> rows = new ArrayList<String[]>();    while ((line = bfr.readLine()) != null) {        String[] row = line.split(\" \");         rows.add(row);       }    System.out.println(rows.toString());  But I get [Ljava.lang.String;@525483cd as result.
