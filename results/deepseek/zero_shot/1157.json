This returns data split by \u00a7. In eclipse, when run as an application, the code works fine. The issue is when I bring it to Android. I have done some research on this but haven't been able to find a working solution.

This is what happens in eclipse. In android, I get a 1-long String[] with the value \"Look like this\u00a70\u00a725\".

In this case, the delimiter is \"\u00a7\". The countTokens() method returns the number of tokens in the string, which is 3 in this case. The nextToken() method returns the next token in the string, which is \"Look like this\". The loop continues until all tokens have been processed.\n\nA: I'm not sure what you're asking, but I'll try to answer it.\n\nDoes anyone know if this is an issue with android or am I doing something wrong?\n\nIt's not an issue with Android. It's an issue with your code.\n\nI have done some research on this but haven't been able to find a working solution. (Have tried Pattern.quote(\"\u00a7\"))\n\nYou're not doing anything wrong. You're just not using the right tool for the job.\n\nHere is an example of what I'm running:\nString input = \"Look like this\u00a70\u00a725\";\nString[] data = input.split(\"\u00a7\");\n\nThe expected data would be a 3-long String[] with the values \"Look like this\", \"0\", and \"25\".\n\nThat's not how split() works. It doesn't split on \"\u00a7\". It splits on the character \"\u00a7\".\n\nIn eclipse, when run as an application, the code works fine.\n\nThat's because you're using a different version of Java. In Eclipse, you're using Java 1.7. In Android, you're using Java 1.6.\n\nIn android, I get a 1-long String[] with the value \"Look like this\u00a70\u00a725\".\n\nThat's because you're using a different version of Java.
