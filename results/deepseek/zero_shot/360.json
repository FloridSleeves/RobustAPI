Why can't I have just Map.Entry m = i.next();?Sorry. It is a HashMap.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Because i.next() returns an Object, and Map.Entry is not an Object.\n\n*You can't have just Map.Entry m = i.next(); because i.next() returns an Object, and Map.Entry is not an Object.\n\n\nQuestion:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the difference between the two methods?\n\n*What is the difference between the two methods?\n\n\nAnswer:\n\n\n*\n\n*The first method returns a Map.Entry object, and the second method returns an Object.\n\n*The first method returns a Map.Entry object, and the second method returns an Object.\n\n\nQuestion:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the difference between the two methods?\n\n*What is the difference between the two methods?\n\n\nAnswer:\n\n\n*\n\n*The first method returns a Map.Entry object, and the second method returns an Object.\n\n*The first method returns a Map.Entry object, and the second method returns an Object.\n\n\nQuestion:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the difference between the two methods?\n\n*What is the difference between the two methods?\n\n\nAnswer:\n\n\n*\n\n*The first method returns a Map.Entry object, and the second method returns an Object.\n\n*The first method returns a Map.Entry object, and the second method returns an Object.\n\n\nQuestion:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the difference between the two methods?\n\n*What is the difference between the two methods?\n\n\nAnswer:\n\n\n*\n\n*The first method returns a Map.Entry object, and the second method returns an Object.\n\n*The first method returns a Map.Entry object, and the second method returns an Object.\n\n\nQuestion:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the difference between the two methods?\n\n*What is the difference between the two methods?\n\n\nAnswer:\n\n\n*\n\n*The first method returns a Map.Entry object, and the second method returns an Object.\n\n*The first method returns a Map.Entry object, and the second method returns an Object.\n\n\nQuestion:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the difference between the two methods?\n\n*What is the difference between the two methods?\n\n\nAnswer:\n\n\n*\n\n*The first method returns a Map.Entry object, and the second method returns an Object.\n\n*The first method returns a Map.Entry object, and the second method returns an Object.\n\n\nQuestion:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the difference between the two methods?\n\n*What is the difference between the two methods?\n\n\nAnswer:\n\n\n*\n\n*The first method returns a Map.Entry object, and the second method returns an Object.\n\n*The first method returns a Map.Entry object, and the second method returns an Object.\n\n\nQuestion:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the difference between the two methods?\n\n*What is the difference between the two methods?\n\n\nAnswer:\n\n\n*\n\n*The first method returns a Map.Entry object, and the second method returns an Object.\n\n*The first method returns a Map.Entry object, and the second method returns an Object.\n\n\nQuestion:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the difference between the two methods?\n\n*What is the difference between the two methods?\n\n\nAnswer:\n\n\n*\n\n*The first method returns a Map.Entry object, and the second method returns an Object.\n\n*The first method returns a Map.Entry object, and the second method returns an Object.\n\n\nQuestion:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the difference between the two methods?\n\n*What is the difference between the two methods?\n\n\nAnswer:\n\n\n*\n\n*The first method returns a Map.Entry object, and the second method returns an Object.\n\n*The first method returns a Map.Entry object, and the second method returns an Object.\n\n\nQuestion:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the difference between the two methods?\n\n*What is the difference between the two methods?\n\n\nAnswer:\n\n\n*\n\n*The first method returns a Map.Entry object, and the second method returns an Object.\n\n*The first method returns a Map.Entry object, and the second method returns an Object.\n\n\nQuestion"}
