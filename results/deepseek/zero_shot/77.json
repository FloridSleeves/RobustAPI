I can't do it in one time so I can't put my arrays in a container. Also the size of my arrays is variable.Secondly, the file is very huge, so I have to split it, in order to read it array by array.How can I do that ? I tried to write line by line my byte arrays  but I haven't been able. How can I put a separator between my arrays and after split it over this separator ?EDIT : I tried this :ByteArrayOutputStream bos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();ObjectOutput out = new ObjectOutputStream(bos);out.writeObject(byteArray);But, I execute this code several times, so the ObjectOutputStream adds each time a new header which corrupt the file.I also try : out.write(byteArray);but I couldn't separate my arrays. So I tried to append a '\\n', which didn't work. After I was looking for library like FileUtils in order to write byte[] line by line but I didn't find.\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Write and read multiple byte[] in file with Java: :I have to write byte arrays in a file.
