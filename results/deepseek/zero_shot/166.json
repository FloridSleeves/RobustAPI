This object can be used to read the contents of a file.  The ImageIcon constructor can take an InputStream as a parameter.  This allows you to read the contents of a file and display it as an image.\n\nA: You need to use getResourceAsStream() to get the InputStream for the image.\nImageIcon i = new ImageIcon(getClass().getResourceAsStream(\"test.bmp\"));\n\n\nA: You need to use getResourceAsStream() to get the InputStream for the image.\nImageIcon i = new ImageIcon(getClass().getResourceAsStream(\"test.bmp\"));\n\n\nA: You need to use getResourceAsStream() to get the InputStream for the image.\nImageIcon i = new ImageIcon(getClass().getResourceAsStream(\"test.bmp\"));\n\n"}
