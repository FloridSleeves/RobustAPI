At the end of the session (ie, user \"logout\"), I need to remove the temporary file, and then redirect the user to the initial (\"login\") page. The redirection works fine, but the temporary file remains intact.I presume it has something to do with the path to the file, but I am not quite sure as to what. I create the file when the session initiates: String path = request.getSession().getServletContext().getRealPath(\"/\");File file = File.createTempFile(\"getter\", \".html\", new File(path + \"/tmp/\"));Then, when closing the session, I do:file.delete();I know about file.deleteOnExit(), but... when do I exit a servlet? Perhaps I am confused, but I would surely appreciate any help! :)Thank you in advance!EDITSo, here come some details:I am using a servlet, as I said, for the time being without handling sessions. I agree with @Joop that I will need to implement sessions, but for the time being just wanted to do some simple testing.So, my servlet hagles GET and POST requests. I use a flag in the POST request to call an internal function which instantiates the file (declared in the class as private File file;) to a new temp file. On consecutive calls, the file gets populated and saved. In the page the user sees, I have an anchor referring to the servlet (to 'this', that is), passing a flag as a parameter, a flag that indicates the 'logout'. Then I call another internal function which deletes the file previously instantiated. If it is a matter of sesions, I will implement the manager and post my findings.EDIT 2I implemented an HttpSessionListener, and all seems to work fine. Now, on creating the session, I instantiate a file in my previously declared directory (note that it is not a temp file, I use File file = new File(path + \"/tmp/\" + req.getSession().getId() + \".html\"); so the name of the file equals the session ID). Then I add an attribute to the session, whose value is the full path to the file. I proceed to populate my file as always, and when the user selects to log out, I invalidate the session. Then, inside the listener, I retrieve the path to the file, hence I can acquire the pointer to it:String fname = ev.getSession().getAttribute(\"filename\").toString();File f = new File(fname);f.delete();So, now the messages I am getting are positive, I mean f.delete() returns true, and after this I do f.exists() and I get false. So it should be OK. However, the files physically exist, that is they are still present on the disk. I can try the example so kindly provided by @A4L.
