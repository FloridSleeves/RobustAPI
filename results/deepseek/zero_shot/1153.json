The first line of input is read using the readLine() method of the BufferedReader class. The StringTokenizer class is used to split the input string into tokens. The nextToken() method is used to retrieve the next token from the StringTokenizer object. The tokens are then converted to integers using the parseInt() method.\nQuestion: Can someone post a program template for submitting a solution in Java in Codeforces programming competitions?: :Yes I want to start programming competitions so I dont know how to submit in Java?Answers very apreciatedbye\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\nint n = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\nint m = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\n<<<explanation>>>: This code is used to read input from the user.
