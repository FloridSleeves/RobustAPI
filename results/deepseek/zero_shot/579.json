I require the following output:pdfjavac++cperlCan you please suggest a way to get this?\nPlease using this api: JsonElement.getAsString.\nAnswer:\n\n\n*\n\n*First, you need to convert the JSON string to a JSON object using the JsonParser class.\n\n*Then, you can use the JsonElement.getAsString method to get the string value of the JSON object.\n\n*Finally, you can use the String.split method to split the string into an array of words.\n\n\nHere is an example of how you can use these methods to split the JSON string:\nString jsonString = \"{\\\"Tags\\\": [\\\"pdf\\\", \\\"java\\\", \\\"c++\\\", \\\"perl\\\", \\\"pdf\\\", \\\"c\\\", \\\"java\\\", \\\"c++\\\"]}\";\nJsonParser parser = new JsonParser();\nJsonObject jsonObject = parser.parse(jsonString).getAsJsonObject();\nString tags = jsonObject.get(\"Tags\").getAsString();\nString[] words = tags.split(\"\\\\s+\");\n\nThis will split the string into an array of words, which you can then use to remove duplicates.\n"}
