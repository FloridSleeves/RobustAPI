The correct syntax is:\nparams.put(\"key\", \"value\");\n\nIn this case, you are trying to put a value into a HashMap with a key of \"test\", but you are not using the correct syntax. The correct syntax is:\nparams.put(\"test\", \"test\");\n\nThis will add a key-value pair to the HashMap with a key of \"test\" and a value of \"test\".\n"}
