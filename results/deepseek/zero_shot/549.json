I went through this way: Preferences -> Java -> Compiler -> Errors / Warnings -> Deprecated and Restricted API. Then i changed errors to warnings. But now i can not use that library efficient, cause eclipse suggest me nothing about that library.My first question is; if there is a better way to do that? Or maybe another way to use this library efficient in eclipse?EDIT: I found out it was a complication of 32 and 64 bit versions. After installing 32bit JDK and reference the jai_imageio.jar it worked fine.And second; Can anybody give a plain example to me about converting .bmp image to jpeg2000 image. That would help a lot to me about undesrtanding the context.Thank you\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Converting images from .bmp to jpeg2000 on java and eclipse error: :I have seen some examples here and installed Java Advanced Imaging Image I/O Tools on my computer, because obviously it is a requirement of processing JPEG2000 images.After install this i am able to import librariese.g. import com.sun.media.imageio.plugins.*;after importing, i should be able to use constructors or methods of that library but i am getting this error: \"Access restriction: The type 'J2KImageWriteParam' is not API (restriction on required library 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Java\\jre1.8.0_77\\lib\\ext\\jai_imageio.jar')\" After a litle bit research, i found out that i can change eclipse preferences and ignore that error.

This method may be called repeatedly to iterate through the list, or intermixed with calls to hasNext() to check for the presence of more elements.\n\nA: I'm not sure what you mean by \"better way to do that\".  The only way to use a library is to import it.  If you don't want to import it, then you can't use it.\nThe error you're getting is because you're trying to use a class that is not part of the public API.  The JAI Image I/O Tools are part of the Java Advanced Imaging (JAI) project, and are not part of the public API.  You can't use them.\nIf you want to convert BMP to JPEG2000, you can use the JAI Image I/O Tools to read the BMP file, and then use the JAI Image I/O Tools to write the JPEG2000 file.  You can use the JAI Image I/O Tools to read the BMP file because the BMP file format is part of the public API.  You can use the JAI Image I/O Tools to write the JPEG2000 file because the JPEG2000 file format is part of the public API.\n"}
