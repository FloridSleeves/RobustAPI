It returns an int value which contains the byte read, or -1 if the end of the stream has been reached.\nThe code reads the contents of the file \"C:\\\\Users\\\\user\\\\Desktop\\\\test.txt\" and prints it to the console.\nThe code uses a try-catch-finally block to open the file, read its contents, and close the file.\nThe code uses a while loop to read the contents of the file until the end of the stream is reached.\nThe code uses the (char) data cast to convert the int value returned by InputStream.read() to a char value.\nThe code uses the System.out.print() method to print the char value to the console.\nThe code uses the finally block to close the file.\n"}
