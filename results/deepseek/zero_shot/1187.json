In this case, the string is broken into two tokens using the comma as the delimiter. The first token is assigned to the firstName variable, and the second token is assigned to the lastName variable. The trim() method is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the tokens. Finally, the method returns the lastName and firstName variables in the desired format.\n\n"}
