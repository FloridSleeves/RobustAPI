The msg variable is a byte array that contains the handshake message that you want to send to the server.\n\nA: You are using the wrong method.\nThe method you are using is DataOutputStream.writeByte(int b) which writes a single byte to the output stream.\nYou should use DataOutputStream.write(byte[] b) which writes a byte array to the output stream.\n"}
