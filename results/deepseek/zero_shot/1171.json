Improve this question                    How to read the CSV file in Java?I assume I need to use an InputStream.How do I continue after the InputStream declaration?InputStream file = item.getInputStream();\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:\n\n\n*\n\n*The API is StringTokenizer.nextToken().\n\n*The code is:\n\n\nStringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(line, \",\");\nString name = st.nextToken();\nString age = st.nextToken();\nString gender = st.nextToken();\n\n\n*The explanation is:\n\n\nThe StringTokenizer class is used to break a string into tokens. The tokens are obtained by a call to the nextToken() method. The nextToken() method returns the next token from this string tokenizer.\n\nA: I'm not sure what you mean by \"I need to use an InputStream\".  You can use a FileInputStream, or a BufferedReader.  I'm not sure what you mean by \"How do I continue after the InputStream declaration?\"  You'll need to read the file line by line, and then tokenize each line.  Something like this:\nBufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"file.csv\"));\nString line = null;\nwhile ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {\n    StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(line, \",\");\n    String name = st.nextToken();\n    String age = st.nextToken();\n    String gender = st.nextToken();\n}\n\n"}
