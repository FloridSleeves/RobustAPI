An attempt is made to read as many as len bytes, but a smaller number may be read. The byte at index off in the array b is the first byte read into the array. If no byte is available because the end of the file has been reached, the method returns -1.\nQuestion: Resource file format processing in Java: :I am trying to implement a processor for a specific resource archive file format in Java.
