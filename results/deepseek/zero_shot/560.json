If you want to remove the first k elements from a map, then you can do that by iterating over the map's keyset, and removing the first k elements.  That will be O(k) time, since it will take O(k) time to iterate over the first k elements, and O(1) time to remove each element.  If you want to remove a random element from the map, then you can do that by iterating over the map's keyset, and removing a random element.  That will be O(n) time, since it will take O(n) time to iterate over all of the elements, and O(1) time to remove each element.  If you want to remove a random element from the map, then you can do that by iterating over the map's keyset, and removing a random element.  That will be O(n) time, since it will take O(n) time to iterate over all of the elements, and O(1) time to remove each element.
