However, there is a de facto standard interface, which is the Iterable interface.  This interface has a method called iterator, which returns an Iterator.  This is the interface you want.\nQuestion: What is the difference between the Iterator and Iterable interfaces?: :The Iterator interface is used to iterate over a collection.
