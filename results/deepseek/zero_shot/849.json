An attempt is made to read as many as len bytes, but a smaller number may be read. The number of bytes actually read is returned as an integer.\n\n*If len is zero, then no bytes are read and 0 is returned; otherwise, there is an attempt to read at least one byte. If no byte is available because the stream is at end of file, the value -1 is returned; otherwise, at least one byte is read and stored into b[off].\n\n*The read method of InputStream is an abstract method, so you need to override it in your class.\n\n\nQuestion: How to get the size of a file in Java?: :I want to get the size of a file in Java.
