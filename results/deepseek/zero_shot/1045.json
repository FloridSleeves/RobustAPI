I think it is not better to use String firstname = values.indexOf(10);because I don't know how many characters would the username contain so I could go for lastname an so, I was wondering if there is a better way for getting the values of each parameter and assign it to a new string.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:\nStringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(values, \"&\");\nString firstname = st.nextToken();\nString lastname = st.nextToken();\nString email = st.nextToken();\nString telephone = st.nextToken();\n\nExplanation:\nThe StringTokenizer class is used to break a string into tokens. It is a legacy class that is retained for compatibility reasons although its use is discouraged in new code. It is recommended that anyone seeking this functionality use the split method of String or the java.util.regex package instead.\nThe StringTokenizer class has two constructors:\nStringTokenizer(String str)\nStringTokenizer(String str, String delim)\nThe first constructor creates a StringTokenizer with the specified string. The string is then parsed using the default delimiter set, which is \" \\t\\n\\r\\f\": the space character, the tab character, the newline character, the carriage-return character, and the form-feed character.\nThe second constructor creates a StringTokenizer that parses the specified string using the specified delimiter set.\nThe StringTokenizer class provides three methods for tokenizing strings:\nboolean hasMoreTokens()\nReturns true if there are more tokens.\nString nextToken()\nReturns the next token from this string tokenizer.\nString nextToken(String delim)\nReturns the next token from this string tokenizer.\n\nA: I think you are looking for something like this:\nString values = \"firstname=john&lastname=fob&email=something@something.com&Telephone=3874813781\";\nString[] tokens = values.split(\"&\");\nString firstname = tokens[0].split(\"=\")[1];\nString lastname = tokens[1].split(\"=\")[1];\nString email = tokens[2].split(\"=\")[1];\nString telephone = tokens[3].split(\"=\")[1];\n\n\nA: I think you are looking for something like this:\nString values = \"firstname=john&lastname=fob&email=something@something.com&Telephone=3874813781\";\nString[] tokens = values.split(\"&\");\nString firstname = tokens[0].split(\"=\")[1];\nString lastname = tokens[1].split(\"=\")[1];\nString email = tokens[2].split(\"=\")[1];\nString telephone = tokens[3].split(\"=\")[1];\n\n"}
