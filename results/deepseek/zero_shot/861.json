and how does the code above knows to move on to the next value for lastName.So simply put, byte b1[] = new byte[ 15 ];      file.readFully( b1 );      firstName = new String( b1, 0 );      firstName = firstName.trim();VS      byte b2[] = new byte[ 15 ];      file.readFully( b2 );      lastName = new String( b2, 0 );      lastName = lastName.trim();      balance = file.readDouble();Why doesnt it give the same value?
