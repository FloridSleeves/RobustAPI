So I guess this is kind of \"risky\". I tried using another overload of toArray:V[] array = new V[values.size()];array = values.toArray (array);And I guess this is not how you would use the overload because there's a compiler error saying that I cannot initialize V.So I think maybe I should use the first method. But how do I \"check\" a cast to cancel the warning?Or, you can tell me how to use the toArray(T[] array) overload correctly.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to \"check\" a cast?: :I wrote a method that gets a random value from a Map.

This method may be called repeatedly to iterate through the set of values, or intermixed with calls to hasNext to check if the iteration has more elements.\n\nA: The warning is telling you that you are casting an Object[] to a V[] which is not safe.\nYou can use the following code to avoid the warning:\nV[] array = (V[]) values.toArray(new V[0]);\n\nThe new V[0] is a dummy array to avoid the warning.\n"}
