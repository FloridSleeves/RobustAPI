I have tried with runtime.exec and with processBuilder.pb: String cmd = \"ffmpeg -i input.vob output.mp4\" Runtime rt = Runtime.getRuntime();Process proc = rt.exec(cmd); proc.waitFor();This works fine with small input file (say less than 10 Mb). If I give larger input file then program will be hanged. Output file will be partially created and file creation will be hanged and control will not return. Even proc.join(10000); did not give any useful result.

It will not return until the stream is closed or an exception is thrown.\n\n\nA: You can use ProcessBuilder.redirectErrorStream(true) to redirect the error stream to the input stream.\n"}
