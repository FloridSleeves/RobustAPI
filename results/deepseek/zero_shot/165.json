I understand that we use read() to read byte to byte. but how do we do the comparison? \nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:\n<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: \nint read()\n<<<explanation>>>: Reads the next byte of data from the input stream. The value byte is returned as an int in the range 0 to 255. If no byte is available because the end of the stream has been reached, the value -1 is returned. This method blocks until input data is available, the end of the stream is detected, or an exception is thrown.\n\nA: I'm not sure what you mean by \"compare byte to byte in Java using FileInputStream\".\nIf you want to compare two files, you can use the following code:\nFileInputStream fis1 = new FileInputStream(\"file1.txt\");\nFileInputStream fis2 = new FileInputStream(\"file2.txt\");\n\nint ch1, ch2;\n\nwhile ((ch1 = fis1.read()) != -1 && (ch2 = fis2.read()) != -1) {\n    if (ch1 != ch2) {\n        // files are not equal\n    }\n}\n\n// if one file is longer than the other, they are not equal\nif (ch1 != -1 || ch2 != -1) {\n    // files are not equal\n}\n\nfis1.close();\nfis2.close();\n\n"}
