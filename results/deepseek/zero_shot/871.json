The static factory method ensures that there exists only one DatabaseHelper instance at any time.I create in each activity a SQLiteOpenHelper that uses the method getWritableDatabase() but I don't know where to use the close() method.

The query is specified using the parameters. The result is returned as a Cursor object.\n\nA: I'm not sure what you mean by \"I read here that building SQLiteOpenHelper as static data member could be a good practice so I did this\".\nYou don't need to do that. You can just create a new SQLiteOpenHelper in each activity.\n"}
