I have following type of HashMapMap<Integer,ArrayList<String> > trainDataSet = new HashMap<Integer, ArrayList<String>>();I would like to shuffle the values in the Map. How would i do it? Following is my attempt:    collections.shuffle(trainDataSet.values());Got an error:    Values cannot be cast to java.util.ListYes this make sense, because my values are in Arraylist not in List. Would it be possible to shuffle collections of arraylist?EDITIf i have following order::key1  [aa,bb,cd]key2  [xx,xy,sfr]Into something likekey1  [xx,xy,sfr]key2  [aa,bb,cd]\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Shuffling values in HashMap: :I would like to shuffle values in an HashMap.
