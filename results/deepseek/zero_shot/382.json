I then used the hasNext method to check if there is another item in the arraylist. I then used the contains method to check if the item in the arraylist contains the name of the item that the player wants to drop. I then used the hasItem method to check if the room has an item. I then used the addItem method to add the item to the room. I then used the remove method to remove the item from the arraylist. I then used the currentMessage variable to set the message to the player.\n\nA: You can use a for loop instead of the while loop.\nfor(Item count : myArray){\n    if(count.getName().contains(name) && currentRoom.hasItem() == false){\n        currentRoom.addItem(count);\n        currentMessage = \"you have successfully dropped the item in the room\";\n        myArray.remove(count);\n    }\n    else if(count.getName().contains(name) && currentRoom.hasItem() == true){\n        currentMessage = \"the room already has an item\";\n    }\n    else{\n        currentMessage = \"you do not have that item\";\n    }\n}\n\n"}
