As the example in the link says, when writing a struct like this:struct { char c; int i;} a;to a binary file, the compiler will usually leave an unnamed, unused hole between the char and int fields, to ensure that the int field is properly aligned. How could I to create an exact replica of the binary output file (generated in C), using a different language (in my case, Java)?Is there an automatic way to apply C padding in Java output? Or do I have to go through compiler documentation to see how it works (the compiler is g++ by the way).\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Replicating C struct padding in Java: :According to here, the C compiler will pad out values when writing a structure to a binary file.

The value byte is returned as an int in the range 0 to 255. If no byte is available because the end of the stream has been reached, the value -1 is returned. This method blocks until input data is available, the end of the stream is detected, or an exception is thrown.\n\nA: \nHow could I to create an exact replica of the binary output file (generated in C), using a different language (in my case, Java)?\n\nYou can't.\n\nIs there an automatic way to apply C padding in Java output?\n\nNo.\n\nOr do I have to go through compiler documentation to see how it works (the compiler is g++ by the way).\n\nYes.\n"}
