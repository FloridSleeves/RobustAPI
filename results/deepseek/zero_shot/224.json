The read method reads the data from the input stream and stores it in the byte array. The read method returns the number of bytes read from the input stream.\n\nA: I'm not sure what you mean by \"i need to bring out inputstream B from A of Hundred and fiftieth byte to end\".\nIf you mean you want to read a certain number of bytes from the input stream, you can use the read(byte[] b, int off, int len) method.\nFor example, if you want to read 100 bytes from the input stream, you can use the following code:\nbyte[] b = new byte[100];\nint bytesRead = inputStream.read(b, 0, 100);\n\nIf you want to read the rest of the input stream, you can use the following code:\nbyte[] b = new byte[inputStream.available()];\nint bytesRead = inputStream.read(b, 0, inputStream.available());\n\n"}
