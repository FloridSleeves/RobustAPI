It is used to break a string into tokens. The tokens are used for various purposes such as parsing, splitting, etc.\nThe StringTokenizer class has two constructors:\nStringTokenizer(String str)\nStringTokenizer(String str, String delim)\nThe first constructor takes a string as an argument. The second constructor takes two arguments, first is the string and second is the delimiter. The delimiter is used to separate the string.\nThe StringTokenizer class has three methods:\nboolean hasMoreTokens()\nString nextToken()\nString nextToken(String delim)\nThe hasMoreTokens() method returns true if there are more tokens. The nextToken() method returns the next token. The nextToken(String delim) method returns the next token delimited by the specified delimiter.\nThe StringTokenizer class has two fields:\nint count\nString delim\nThe count field is used to count the number of tokens.
