The opmode is the mode of operation, which can be either Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE or Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE. The key is the key to use for the encryption or decryption, and the iv is the initialization vector to use for the encryption or decryption.\nQuestion: Decrypt Rijndael 256 (from PhP) encoded text in java with little information: :I have some data from a external party which is encrypted according to them in: 'Rijndeal 256 with the private key'Alongside these records there are a public and private key certificate which look like RSA certificates.From what i've learned so far it seems the common way to use encryption with certifcates is to generate a 'secret key' or some kind in initialization vector and use this to encrypted text.
