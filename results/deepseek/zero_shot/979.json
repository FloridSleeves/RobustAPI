The \"UTF8\" parameter is the encoding of the byte array. The encoding is important because it tells the cipher how to interpret the byte array. If the encoding is not correct, the cipher will not be able to decrypt the data.\nQuestion: Encrypting and Decrypting Using Java: Unable to get same output: :I am trying to learn and test the java 1.6 encryption/decryption API.
