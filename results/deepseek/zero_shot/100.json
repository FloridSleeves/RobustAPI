The screenshot data is first converted to a byte array using the Bitmap.getByteArray() method. The byte array is then sent to the client using the OutputStream.write() method. The first byte of the byte array is the length of the byte array + 1. The second byte is a 0. The remaining bytes are the actual screenshot data. The OutputStream.flush() method is used to ensure that all the data is sent to the client.\n"}
