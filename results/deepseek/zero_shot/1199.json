If I wanted to find the positions of each 1 and add them to an array, how would I go about doing that? I tried to use indexOf('1'), but it keeps returning 0 or 1 as the index.

I just wanted to keep someone from jumping in and telling me exactly how to convert from binary to dec rather than answering my current question...Edit2: Okay, I'll be more specific. Basically, I'm trying to take a binary number(s), flip them around and get the positions of the ones and add them to an array. Then I'm going to try to iterate through the array, taking 2 to the power of each position and adding them up. Maybe not the most efficient way to convert from binary to decimal, but it's what I came up with. \nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Finding the position of every one of a certain repeated char/substring in a string: :While it's painfully obvious what I'm trying to do, I'd prefer not to be told how to come up with the end result even if the way I'm going about it is wrong (Hints will be appreciated though).

Maybe not the most efficient way to convert from binary to decimal, but it's what I came up with. \nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:\nStringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(binary, \"1\");\nwhile(st.hasMoreTokens()) {\n    int index = st.nextToken().length();\n    System.out.println(index);\n}\n\nExplanation:\nThe StringTokenizer class is used to break a string into tokens. The first argument is the string to be broken into tokens, and the second argument is the delimiter. In this case, the delimiter is \"1\", which means that the string will be broken into tokens whenever a \"1\" is found.\nThe while loop is used to iterate through the tokens. The hasMoreTokens() method is used to check if there are more tokens to be iterated through. The nextToken() method is used to get the next token. The length() method is used to get the length of the token. The length of the token is the position of the \"1\" in the binary number.\n\nA: I'm not sure what you mean by \"flip them around\", but if you want to get the positions of the ones in a binary number, you can use the following code:\nString binary = \"01110101\";\nint[] positions = new int[binary.length()];\nint index = 0;\nfor (int i = 0; i < binary.length(); i++) {\n    if (binary.charAt(i) == '1') {\n        positions[index++] = i;\n    }\n}\n\nThis will create an array of integers that contains the positions of the ones in the binary number.\n\nA: I'm not sure what you mean by \"flip them around\", but if you want to get the positions of the ones in a binary number, you can use the following code:\nString binary = \"01110101\";\nint[] positions = new int[binary.length()];\nint index = 0;\nfor (int i = 0; i < binary.length(); i++) {\n    if (binary.charAt(i) == '1') {\n        positions[index++] = i;\n    }\n}\n\nThis will create an array of integers that contains the positions of the ones in the binary number.\n\nA: I'm not sure what you mean by \"flip them around\", but if you want to get the positions of the ones in a binary number, you can use the following code:\nString binary = \"01110101\";\nint[] positions = new int[binary.length()];\nint index = 0;\nfor (int i = 0; i < binary.length(); i++) {\n    if (binary.charAt(i) == '1') {\n        positions[index++] = i;\n    }\n}\n\nThis will create an array of integers that contains the positions of the ones in the binary number.\n\nA: I'm not sure what you mean by \"flip them around\", but if you want to get the positions of the ones in a binary number, you can use the following code:\nString binary = \"01110101\";\nint[] positions = new int[binary.length()];\nint index = 0;\nfor (int i = 0; i < binary.length(); i++) {\n    if (binary.charAt(i) == '1') {\n        positions[index++] = i;\n    }\n}\n\nThis will create an array of integers that contains the positions of the ones in the binary number.\n\nA: I'm not sure what you mean by \"flip them around\", but if you want to get the positions of the ones in a binary number, you can use the following code:\nString binary = \"01110101\";\nint[] positions = new int[binary.length()];\nint index = 0;\nfor (int i = 0; i < binary.length(); i++) {\n    if (binary.charAt(i) == '1') {\n        positions[index++] = i;\n    }\n}\n\nThis will create an array of integers that contains the positions of the ones in the binary number.\n\nA: I'm not sure what you mean by \"flip them around\", but if you want to get the positions of the ones in a binary number, you can use the following code:\nString binary = \"01110101\";\nint[] positions = new int[binary.length()];\nint"}
