If the client sends me a byte of value 0, it is not received by the server. The second issue is, if the byte value is 128 or more, I keep receiving a value of 65533 or a binary value of 11111101.

This is because the server is reading the input stream using the read() method, which returns an integer value representing the next byte of data from the input stream. If the client sends a byte of value 0, the server will not receive it because the read() method will return 0.\nThe second issue is that the server is receiving a value of 65533 or a binary value of 11111101.

This is because the read() method returns an integer value representing the next byte of data from the input stream.\nTo solve these issues, you can use the read(byte[] b) method of the InputStream class to read the input stream into a byte array. This method returns the number of bytes read, which you can use to determine if the client has sent a byte of value 0 or a byte of value 128 or more. You can then use the byte array to construct a string representation of the data received from the client.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:\n<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>:\nwhile (!Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) {\n    try {\n        int r;\n        String response = \"\";\n        byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\n        int bytesRead = input.read(buffer);\n        for (int i = 0; i < bytesRead; i++) {\n            if (buffer[i] == 0) {\n                // do something\n            }\n            if (buffer[i] >= 128) {\n                // do something\n            }\n            response += (char) buffer[i];\n        }\n        ...\n    }\n    ...\n}\n<<<explanation>>>:\nThe first issue is that the client is sending a byte of value 0, which is not received by the server.
