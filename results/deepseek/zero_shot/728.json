The constructor takes a FileWriter object as an argument, which is used to write the text to the file. The true argument passed to the FileWriter constructor specifies that the text should be appended to the file, rather than overwriting it.\nThe println method is used to write a line of text to the file. The text is passed as an argument to the method.\nThe close method is used to close the PrintWriter object. This is important to do, as it ensures that the file is properly closed and that all data is written to the file.\n"}
