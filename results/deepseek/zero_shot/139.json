This is a memory-mapped file. This means that the data is not written to the file immediately. Instead, it is written to memory, and then written to the file when the memory is full.\nThis is a good thing, because it allows you to write large amounts of data to the file without having to worry about the performance of the write operation.\nHowever, it also means that the data is not guaranteed to be written to the file immediately. If the program crashes or is terminated, the data may not be written to the file.\nTo write the data to the file immediately, you can use the FileChannel.write() method instead of the map() method. This will write the data to the file immediately, and will not require any memory-mapped files.\n"}
