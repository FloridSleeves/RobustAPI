(I don't know if this makes a difference since as I mentioned in the other question my arrays are small -50 elements-). If this does not make a difference point it out though.I am not interested in the value per se, only the indices.My question is whether there is a faster approach to go with it?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Getting the indices of an unsorted double array after sorting: :This question comes as a companion of this one that regarded fastest sorting of a double array.Now I want to get the top-k indices corresponding to the unsorted array.I have implemented this version which (unfortunately) uses autoboxing and HashMap as proposed in some answers including this one:HashMap<Double, Integer> map = new HashMap<Double, Integer>();for(int i = 0; i < numClusters; i++) {    map.put(scores[i], i);}Arrays.sort(scores);HashSet<Integer> topPossibleClusters = new HashSet<Integer>();for(int i = 0; i < numClusters; i++) {    topPossibleClusters.add(map.get(scores[numClusters - (i+1)]));}As you can see this uses a HashMap with keys the Double values of the original array and as values the indices of the original array.So, after sorting the original array I just retrieve it from the map.I also use HashSet as I am interested in deciding if an int is included in this set, using .contains() method.
