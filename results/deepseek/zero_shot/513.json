I have an add method where if you add an object the object will be the key, and its value will be 1 if the object is not currently in the list.

I understand in practice when I iterate through the map, there is actually only one object to iterate, however, I am trying to create a inner class that will define an iterator that will iterate the same object however many times its value is. I can do this by simply using for loops to construct an appropriate ArrayList and just create an iterator for that, but that is too inefficient.

The add method adds a key to the map and increments its value by 1 if the key already exists in the map. If the key does not exist, it is added to the map with a value of 1.\nThe CustomMapIterator class implements the Iterator interface and is used to iterate over the keys of the map. The iterator is initialized with an ArrayList that contains the keys of the map in the order they were added to the map. The hasNext method returns true if there are more keys to iterate over, and the next method returns the next key in the iteration.\nThis implementation of the CustomMap class and CustomMapIterator class is efficient because it uses a hash map to store the key-value pairs, and the CustomMapIterator class uses an ArrayList to iterate over the keys in the order they were added to the map. This approach is also easy to implement and understand.\n"}
