The value byte is returned as an int in the range 0 to 255. If no byte is available because the end of the stream has been reached, the value -1 is returned. This method blocks until input data is available, the end of the stream is detected, or an exception is thrown.\nQuestion: Java protocol design: :Im planning to deploy a version for some IETF drafts and need some code references or guidance.
