The value byte is returned as an int in the range 0 to 255. If no byte is available because the end of the stream has been reached, the value -1 is returned. This method blocks until input data is available, the end of the stream is detected, or an exception is thrown.\n<<<explanation>>>:\nThis method reads the next byte of data from the input stream.

If you're reading a binary file, you're going to have to read it in chunks.  You can do this with a loop.  For example:\nint bytesRead = 0;\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\nwhile ((bytesRead = in.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n    // do something with the buffer\n}\n\nThe buffer will contain the bytes read from the file.  You can then do whatever you want with them.  For example, you could write them to a file, or you could write them to a JProgressBar.\n"}
