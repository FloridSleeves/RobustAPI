The new operator is used to create a new instance of a class, but E is a type parameter, so it can be any type. Therefore, the new operator cannot be used to create a new instance of E.\nTo fix this, you can use a different approach. For example, you can create a method that takes an E and a Bar as parameters, and returns a new instance of E. This method can then be used to create a new instance of E from a Bar.\nFor example:\npublic E createNewE(E e, Bar bar) {\n    return new E(bar);\n}\n\nThen, you can use this method to create a new instance of E from a Bar:\nBar bar = innerIterator.next();\nE e = createNewE(e, bar);\n\n\nA: You can use the following code:\npublic class FooIterator<E> implements Iterator<E> {\n    public FooIterator(Collection<Bar> bars) {\n        innerIterator = bars.iterator();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public boolean hasNext() {\n        return innerIterator.hasNext();\n    }\n\n    @SuppressWarnings(\"unchecked\")\n    @Override\n    public E next() {\n        Bar bar = innerIterator.next();\n        return (E) new E(bar);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void remove() {\n        throw new UnsupportedOperationException(\"Don't remove from FooIterator!\");\n    }\n\n    private Iterator<Bar> innerIterator;\n}\n\n"}
