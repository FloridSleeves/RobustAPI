I have tried passing different data types to the function, a simple File, and an InputStream, but both returned null also. The documentation says that if no suitable ImageInputStreamSpi is found then the function will return null, but the file is a bog-standard JPEG, and surely Java comes with a service provider for such a format out of the box?Thanks for your time./** * Reads in an image from a file and returns the image in a * {@code BufferedImage} object. * * @param source the file to create the {@code BufferedImage} * from. * @return the {@code BufferedImage} object representing the image * in {@code source}. */private BufferedImage readImage( File source ) {    // There is only one image in this file    final int imageIndex = 0;    BufferedImage image = null;    try {        // Get the ImageReader object for this filetype        Iterator readers =            ImageIO.getImageReaders( source );        ImageReader reader = (ImageReader) readers.next();        // Create an ImageInputStream object from the source image file        ImageInputStream iis = ImageIO.createImageInputStream( source );        // Raises IllegalArgumentException, because iis is null        reader.setInput( iis, true );        // Read the image file        image = reader.read( imageIndex );    } catch ( Exception exception ) {        exception.printStackTrace();        System.exit( -1 );    }    return image;}\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: ImageIO.createImageInputStream Keeps Returning null: :Hey all,Whenever I try to get an ImageInputStream object using ImageIO.createImageInputStream it simply returns null with no exceptions, warnings or errors.

It throws a NoSuchElementException if the iteration has no more elements.\nExplanation: The Iterator interface defines a method called next() that returns the next element in the iteration. If the iteration has no more elements, the next() method throws a NoSuchElementException.\nQuestion: ImageIO.createImageInputStream Keeps Returning null: :Hey all,Whenever I try to get an ImageInputStream object using ImageIO.createImageInputStream it simply returns null with no exceptions, warnings or errors.

The ImageReader objects are obtained from the ImageIO service provider registry, which is populated with service providers that can read specific image file formats. The getImageReaders() method takes a File object as input and returns an iterator of ImageReader objects that can read the specified image file.\nQuestion: ImageIO.createImageInputStream Keeps Returning null: :Hey all,Whenever I try to get an ImageInputStream object using ImageIO.createImageInputStream it simply returns null with no exceptions, warnings or errors.
