Is there any other way I can do this with FileReader? I know that there is the BOMInputStream that should work, but I'd rather find a solution using FileReader.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Removing the BOM character with Java: :This question already has answers here:                                                            Byte order mark screws up file reading in Java                                (11 answers)                            Closed 8 years ago.I am trying to read files using FileReader and write them into a separate file.These files are UTF-8 encoded, but unfortuantely some of them still contain a BOM.The relevant code I tried is this:private final String UTF8_BOM = \"\\uFEFF\"; private String removeUTF8BOM(String s)    {        if (s.startsWith(UTF8_BOM))        {            s=s.replace(UTF8_BOM, \"\");        }        return s;    }    line=removeUTF8BOM(line);But for some reason the BOM is not removed.
