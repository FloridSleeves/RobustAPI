In the game there is a grid that is populated by cells. Each cell has a partner (same type of cell). There should be 24 total cells which would mean 12 different pairs of cells. For example a cell can be type 1, there will be two type 1 cells on the grid.All the way until type 12.What I'm trying to achieve with my code is to randomly generate a row and column and then place a cell of type 1 on it. AGAIN, generate random row and column and place type 1 cell on it.Then increment type.Now what I am struggling with is the condition that will make sure my entire grid is fully populated with cells.Further more a condition that makes sure that once a cell has been placed at a spot on the grid, it cannot be replaced by another cell.Here is the code that I've come up with for now.     int type =1;    int row=0;    int column=0;    board[row][column] = new Cell(this, type, row, column);    while(board[row][column] != null){      if(type <=12){      row = generator.nextInt(4);      column = generator.nextInt(6);            board[row][column] = new Cell(this, type, row, column);      type++;        if (type < 13){      row = generator.nextInt(4);            column = generator.nextInt(6);            board[row][column] = new Cell(this, type, row, column);      row = generator.nextInt(4);      column = generator.nextInt(6);      board[row][column] = new Cell(this, type, row, column);      add(board[row][column]);} //Adding a Cell object **board is a 2d array of type Cell**      }  }  }Tried my best to explain the problem in the most simple terms\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: JAVA Need a condition to check whether the entire 2D array is full: :I'm making a game.
