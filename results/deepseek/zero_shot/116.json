Thank You\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:\n<<<api>>>: DataOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>:\nDataOutputStream.write(int b);\nDataOutputStream.write(byte[] b);\nDataOutputStream.write(byte[] b, int off, int len);\n<<<explanation>>>:\nThe write(int b) method writes the specified byte to the output stream.\nThe write(byte[] b) method writes the specified byte array to the output stream.\nThe write(byte[] b, int off, int len) method writes len bytes from the specified byte array starting at offset off to the output stream.\n\nA: I'm not sure what you mean by \"stuck\".  I'm assuming you're having trouble with the length field.  The length field is a 4-byte unsigned long in network order (big endian).  You can convert a long to a byte array using the following code:\nlong l = 5022L;\nbyte[] bytes = new byte[4];\nbytes[0] = (byte) (l >> 24);\nbytes[1] = (byte) (l >> 16);\nbytes[2] = (byte) (l >> 8);\nbytes[3] = (byte) l;\n\nYou can then write the byte array to the output stream using the write(byte[] b) method.\n"}
