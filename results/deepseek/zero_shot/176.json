This will allow you to read the body data starting from the correct position in the input stream.\nExplanation: The InputStream.mark() method marks the current position in the input stream, and the InputStream.reset() method resets the position to the marked position. This allows you to read the body data starting from the correct position in the input stream.\nQuestion: I'm trying to implement a simple http server in java.
