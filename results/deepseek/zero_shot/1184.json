The next token is defined as the first non-whitespace character after the last token. The method returns null if there are no more tokens.\nQuestion: How do I get the sum of two numbers from a file?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:\n<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(f.readLine());\n<<<explanation>>>: The readLine() method reads a line of text. A line is considered to be terminated by any one of a line feed ('\\n'), a carriage return ('\\r'), or a carriage return followed immediately by a line feed.\nQuestion: How do I get the sum of two numbers from a file?\nPlease using this api: Integer.parseInt.\nAnswer:\n<<<api>>>: Integer.parseInt\n<<<code>>>: int i1 = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\n<<<explanation>>>: The parseInt() method parses a string argument as a signed decimal integer. The characters in the string must all be decimal digits, except that the first character may be an ASCII minus sign '-' ('\\u002D') to indicate a negative value or an ASCII plus sign '+' ('\\u002B') to indicate a positive value. The resulting integer value is returned.\nQuestion: How do I get the sum of two numbers from a file?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.println.\nAnswer:\n<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.println\n<<<code>>>: out.println(i1+i2);\n<<<explanation>>>: The println() method prints a line of text. The line is terminated by a line separator. The line separator string is defined by the system property line.separator, and is not necessarily a single newline ('\\n') character.\nQuestion: How do I get the sum of two numbers from a file?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.close.\nAnswer:\n<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.close\n<<<code>>>: out.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The close() method closes the stream, flushing it first. Once the stream has been closed, further write() or print() calls will cause an IOException to be thrown. Closing a previously-closed stream has no effect.\nQuestion: How do I get the sum of two numbers from a file?\nPlease using this api: BufferedWriter.close.\nAnswer:\n<<<api>>>: BufferedWriter.close\n<<<code>>>: out.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The close() method closes the stream, flushing it first. Once the stream has been closed, further write() or print() calls will cause an IOException to be thrown. Closing a previously-closed stream has no effect.\nQuestion: How do I get the sum of two numbers from a file?\nPlease using this api: FileReader.\nAnswer:\n<<<api>>>: FileReader\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader f = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"test.in.txt\"));\n<<<explanation>>>: The FileReader class is a subclass of the InputStreamReader class. It reads bytes from a file and decodes them into characters using the platform's default character encoding.\nQuestion: How do I get the sum of two numbers from a file?\nPlease using this api: FileWriter.\nAnswer:\n<<<api>>>: FileWriter\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(\"test.out.txt\")));\n<<<explanation>>>: The FileWriter class is a character-output stream that writes characters to a file.\nQuestion: How do I get the sum of two numbers from a file?\nPlease using this api: BufferedWriter.\nAnswer:\n<<<api>>>: BufferedWriter\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(\"test.out.txt\")));\n<<<explanation>>>: The BufferedWriter class is a filter writer on top of an existing writer, that buffers characters so as to provide for the efficient writing of single characters,"}
