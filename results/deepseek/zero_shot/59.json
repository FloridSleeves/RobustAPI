It then checks if the line starts with a \"#\" character, which indicates a comment line. If it does, it skips the line and continues to the next one. If the line does not start with a \"#\" character, it splits the line into two parts using the \"=\" character as the delimiter. If the line does not contain an \"=\" character, it skips the line and continues to the next one. If the line contains an \"=\" character, it extracts the key and value from the line and does something with them.\n"}
