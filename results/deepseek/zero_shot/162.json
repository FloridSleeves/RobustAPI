Also is it better to just read up the input stream into an array or string and then create input streams for each use ?EDIT 2:Sorry to reopen the question, but the conditions are somewhat different when working inside desktop and web application. First of all, the InputStream i get from the org.apache.commons.fileupload.FileItem in my tomcat web app doesn't support markings thus cannot reset. Second, I'd like to be able to keep the file in memory for faster acces and less io problems when dealing with files.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to Cache InputStream for Multiple Use: :I have an InputStream of a file and i use apache poi components to read from it like this:POIFSFileSystem fileSystem = new POIFSFileSystem(inputStream);The problem is that i need to use the same stream multiple times and the POIFSFileSystem closes the stream after use.What is the best way to cache the data from the input stream and then serve more input streams to different POIFSFileSystem ?EDIT 1:By cache i meant store for later use, not as a way to speedup the application.

The method returns the number of bytes read, or -1 if the end of the stream has been reached.\n\nA: I'm not sure what you mean by \"caching the data from the input stream and then serve more input streams to different POIFSFileSystem\".\nIf you want to read the same data multiple times, you can use a BufferedInputStream.\nIf you want to read the same data multiple times, but don't want to read it from the beginning each time, you can use a PushbackInputStream.\nIf you want to read the same data multiple times, but don't want to read it from the beginning each time, and you don't want to read it into memory, you can use a PipedInputStream.\n"}
