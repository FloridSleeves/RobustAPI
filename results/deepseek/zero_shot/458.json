The type parameter E is not constrained to a class that has a constructor that takes a Bar. This means that the code can be used with any type of E, which could include a class that does not have a constructor that takes a Bar.\nTo make the code type-safe, you can constrain the type parameter E to a class that has a constructor that takes a Bar. For example:\npublic class FooIterator<E extends Bar> implements Iterator<E> {\n  public FooIterator(Collection<Bar> bars) {\n    innerIterator = bars.iterator();\n  }\n  @Override\n  public boolean hasNext() {\n    return innerIterator.hasNext();\n  }\n  @Override\n  public E next() {\n    Bar bar = innerIterator.next();\n    return (E) bar;\n  }\n  @Override\n  public void remove() {\n    throw new UnsupportedOperationException(\"Don't remove from FooIterator!\");\n  }\n  private Iterator<Bar> innerIterator;\n}\nThis code will only compile if E is a subtype of Bar, which means that it will only work with classes that have a constructor that takes a Bar.\n"}
