A central component of the original program is a Perl module that does string prefix lookups in a +500 GB sorted text file using binary search (essentially, \"seek\" to a byte offset in the middle of the file, backtrack to nearest newline, compare line prefix with the search string, \"seek\" to half/double that byte offset, repeat until found...)I have experimented with several database solutions but found that nothing beats this in sheer lookup speed with data sets of this size. Do you know of any existing Java library that implements such functionality? Failing that, could you point me to some idiomatic example code that does random access reads in text files?Alternatively, I am not familiar with the new (?) Java I/O libraries but would it be an option to memory-map the 500 GB text file (I'm on a 64-bit machine with memory to spare) and do binary search on the memory-mapped byte array? I would be very interested to hear any experiences you have to share about this and similar problems.\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Binary search in a sorted (memory-mapped ?) file in Java: :I am struggling to port a Perl program to Java, and learning Java as I go.

The RandomAccessFile class provides a seek method to move the file pointer to a specific position in the file. The readLine method reads a line of text from the file. The startsWith method checks if the line starts with the search string. The compareTo method compares the line with the search string. The code uses a while loop to search for the search string in the file. The code uses the start and end variables to keep track of the search range. The code uses the mid variable to calculate the middle position of the search range. The code uses the seek method to move the file pointer to the middle position. The code uses the readLine method to read a line of text from the file. The code uses the startsWith method to check if the line starts with the search string. The code uses the compareTo method to compare the line with the search string. The code uses the if statement to check if the line starts with the search string. If the line starts with the search string, the code prints the line number and breaks the loop. If the line does not start with the search string, the code moves the file pointer to the middle position and repeats the search. The code uses the close method to close the file.\n\n"}
