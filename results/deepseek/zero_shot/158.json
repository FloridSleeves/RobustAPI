To have access to images the client should provide a valid token and sometimes server can return \"expired crsf token\" error. In order to handle this behavior a custom ImageDownloader should be defined. Below is the base implementation of method that should be overrrided in my implementation.protected InputStream getStreamFromNetwork(String imageUri, Object extra) throws IOException {    HttpURLConnection conn = createConnection(imageUri, extra);    int redirectCount = 0;    while (conn.getResponseCode() / 100 == 3 && redirectCount < MAX_REDIRECT_COUNT) {         conn = createConnection(conn.getHeaderField(\"Location\"), extra);         redirectCount++;    }    InputStream imageStream;    try {         imageStream = conn.getInputStream();    } catch (IOException e) {         // Read all data to allow reuse connection (http://bit.ly/1ad35PY)         IoUtils.readAndCloseStream(conn.getErrorStream());         throw e;    }    if (!shouldBeProcessed(conn)) {         IoUtils.closeSilently(imageStream);         throw new IOException(\"Image request failed with response code \" + conn.getResponseCode());    }    return new ContentLengthInputStream(new BufferedInputStream(imageStream, BUFFER_SIZE), conn.getContentLength());}I want to rewrite it to handle invalid token errors. For example, if the server returns such error it should be recognized, token should be regenerated and request repeated. The only solution I come up with is like this (shortened code):imageStream = conn.getInputStream();byte[] body = org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils.toByteArray(imageStream);if (body.length < 300  // high probability to contain err message             && isInvalidToken(body)) {              // handle error}return new ByteArrayInputStream(body);Is is safe to use such kind of solution, considering I use it only for thumbnails of max 80kb size? Are there any other solutions?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Ways to proxy an InputStream: :I am using Android-Universal-Image-Loader to load images from remote server over HTTPS on my Android application.

Are there any other solutions?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:\n<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>:\nInputStream.read\n<<<explanation>>>:\nInputStream.read is a method that reads a single byte from the input stream. It returns the byte as an int value in the range 0 to 255. If no byte is available because the end of the stream has been reached, the value -1 is returned. This method blocks until input data is available, the end of the stream is detected, or an exception is thrown.\n"}
