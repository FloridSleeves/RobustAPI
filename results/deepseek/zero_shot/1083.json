In this case, the string is the value of the Text object passed as the value parameter to the map method. The StringTokenizer constructor takes a string as an argument, and the nextToken() method returns the next token in the string. In this case, the first call to nextToken() skips over the first line, which has just one element. The while loop then iterates over the remaining tokens in the string, skipping over the word and saving the count as the key. The count is set as a Text object, and the one is an IntWritable object with a value of 1. The context.write() method writes the key-value pair to the output file.\n\nA: The StringTokenizer class is used to break a string into tokens.
