I am able to know the location of the start of the GZIP section using magic number and the GZIPInputStream in Java. However, I need to know the compressed size of the gzip section. GZIPInputStream would return me the uncompressed file size.Is there anybody who has an idea? \nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to I find out the size of a GZIP section embedded in firmware?: :I am currently analyzing firmware images which contain many different sections, one of which is a GZIP section.

The number of bytes actually read is returned as an integer. This method blocks until input data is available, end of file is detected, or an exception is thrown.\nread(byte[] b, int off, int len)\nReads up to len bytes of data from the input stream into an array of bytes. An attempt is made to read as many as len bytes, but a smaller number may be read. The number of bytes actually read is returned as an integer.\nread()\nReads the next byte of data from the input stream. The value byte is returned as an int in the range 0 to 255. If no byte is available because the end of the stream has been reached, the value -1 is returned. This method blocks until input data is available, end of file is detected, or an exception is thrown.\n\nA: You can use the GZIPInputStream.getCompressedSize() method.\n"}
