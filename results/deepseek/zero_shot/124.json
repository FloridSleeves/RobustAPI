It then converts the enccmd string to a byte array and appends it to the byte array. Finally, it creates a DatagramPacket object with the byte array as the data, the length of the byte array as the length, and the IP address and port of the destination.\n\nQuestion: Translate Python into Java: :I'm trying to translate a little Python script into Java.
