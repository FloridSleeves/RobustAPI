I am building a word counter in Java using Map<String, Integer> where a word is the String and the amount of times that word was said in a .txt document is Integer. This is all working great...but I am trying to develop a part where it will display at the bottom what the top 5 results are ---> what the top 5 map.values() are.The problem I have run into is after I find the value, I can't get the String with it.Any suggestions would be very helpful to me.\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Finding the Key from Value in Map: :So I am having a bit of trouble understanding how to do this.
