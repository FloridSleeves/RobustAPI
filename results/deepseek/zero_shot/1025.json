The tokens are obtained by a call to nextToken. The StringTokenizer class allows an application to break a string into tokens. The tokens may be delimited by characters or by regular expressions.\n\n\nA: I'm not sure what you mean by \"at a single time\".  If you want to split the string into 3 parts, you can do this:\nString[] parts = number.split(\"[()]\");\n\nIf you want to split the string into 3 parts, but you want to keep the parentheses, you can do this:\nString[] parts = number.split(\"(\\\\()|(\\\\))\");\n\n"}
