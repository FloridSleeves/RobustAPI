The key is the OAuth Consumer Secret.  The base string is the concatenation of the HTTP method, the URL, and the parameters.  The parameters are the OAuth parameters (oauth_consumer_key, oauth_nonce, oauth_signature_method, oauth_timestamp, oauth_version, and oauth_signature).  The parameters are sorted by name, and then concatenated into a string.  The string is then hashed using the HMAC-SHA1 algorithm and the key.  The result is the oauth_signature parameter.\nThe oauth_signature parameter is then added to the request.  The request is then sent to the server.  The server then verifies the signature by hashing the base string with the key and comparing the result to the oauth_signature parameter.  If the two signatures match, the request is accepted.  If the two signatures do not match, the request is rejected.\nThe oauth_signature parameter is not stored anywhere.  It is generated on the client and sent with the request.  The server does not store the oauth_signature parameter.  The server only stores the OAuth Consumer Secret.  The OAuth Consumer Secret is used to generate the oauth_signature parameter on the client.  The oauth_signature parameter is then sent with the request to the server.
