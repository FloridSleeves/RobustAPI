I know the structure from some documentation and would like to use that stream as an ObjectInputStream, but before I can call any self made readObject methods, this approach fails, due to java.io.StreamCorruptedException: invalid stream header. What's the best way to populate java objects from such a byte stream?BTW: Data is coming in as LittleEndian, texts as 16bit chars preceeded by 4 byte size info, e.g.   03 00 00 00 41 00 62 00 63 00   (hex)would result in \"Abc\"\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to access data from a foreign stream: :A web service is providing a binary chunked application/octet-stream.I have to build a reading client in java.

The number of bytes actually read is returned as an integer.\n\nA: I'm not sure what you mean by \"best way\".  You can use the read(byte[]) method of InputStream to read a chunk of data into a byte array.  You can then use the ObjectInputStream class to read the data into an object.\n"}
