Thank you!\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(new FileOutputStream(new File(savestr), true));\n<<<explanation>>>: The PrintWriter constructor takes a FileOutputStream as an argument. The FileOutputStream constructor takes a File and a boolean as arguments. The boolean argument is used to append data to the file.\n"}
