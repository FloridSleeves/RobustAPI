Suppose there are 6 clients connected to the server at the same time and each of the clients are sending some commands to server at the same time. If these clients sending the message to server for every 1 second how can I handle the those messages from the 6 clients on the server side to store it in the table and the acknowledgement to each client. How can i handle these input from from the client. Whether I have to create 6 threads to handle these inputs from the client. Please give me a idea to approach this issue.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Socket Server with multiple client in java: :I have to create a socket server which will listen to multiple client.

It returns an int value with the byte value wrapped in an int in the range 0 to 255. If no byte is available because the end of the stream has been reached, the value -1 is returned.\nThe read(byte[] b) method reads some number of bytes from the input stream and stores them into the byte array b. It returns the total number of bytes read into the array, or -1 if there is no more data because the end of the stream has been reached.\nThe read(byte[] b, int off, int len) method reads up to len bytes of data from the input stream into an array of bytes. It returns the total number of bytes read into the array, or -1 if there is no more data because the end of the stream has been reached.\n\nA: I think you are looking for a multithreaded server.\nYou can use the following code to create a multithreaded server:\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.net.*;\n\npublic class Server {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(1234);\n        while (true) {\n            Socket socket = serverSocket.accept();\n            new Thread(new ClientHandler(socket)).start();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nclass ClientHandler implements Runnable {\n    private Socket socket;\n    public ClientHandler(Socket socket) {\n        this.socket = socket;\n    }\n    public void run() {\n        try {\n            InputStream inputStream = socket.getInputStream();\n            OutputStream outputStream = socket.getOutputStream();\n            byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\n            int bytesRead;\n            while ((bytesRead = inputStream.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n                outputStream.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);\n            }\n            socket.close();\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n"}
