Argh![/code]\n\nA: I'm not sure what you're asking, but I'll try to answer it.\nYou're asking about the syntax of a multi-dimensional array.\nThe syntax is:\nint[][] array = new int[10][10];\n\nThis creates a 10x10 array of ints.\nYou can access the elements of the array using the following syntax:\narray[0][0] = 1;\n\nThis sets the first element of the array to 1.\nYou can also create a multi-dimensional array of objects:\nObject[][] array = new Object[10][10];\n\nThis creates a 10x10 array of objects.\nYou can access the elements of the array using the following syntax:\narray[0][0] = new Object();\n\nThis sets the first element of the array to a new Object.\nYou can also create a multi-dimensional array of arrays:\nint[][][] array = new int[10][10][10];\n\nThis creates a 1"}
