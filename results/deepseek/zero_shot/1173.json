You can then submit your tasks to the pool using the execute method. The pool will then execute the tasks in the order they are submitted.\nHere is an example of how to use a ThreadPoolExecutor to create a pool of threads that will execute your tasks:\nimport java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;\nimport java.util.concurrent.Executors;\n\npublic class ThreadPoolExample {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Create a pool of threads\n        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);\n\n        // Submit tasks to the pool\n        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n            Runnable worker = new WorkerThread(\"\" + i);\n            executor.execute(worker);\n        }\n\n        // Shut down the pool\n        executor.shutdown();\n        while (!executor.isTerminated()) {\n        }\n\n        System.out.println(\"Finished all threads\");\n    }\n\n}\n\nclass WorkerThread implements Runnable {\n\n    private String command;\n\n    public WorkerThread(String s) {\n        this.command = s;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void run() {\n        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + \" Start. Command = \" + command);\n        processCommand();\n        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + \" End.\");\n    }\n\n    private void processCommand() {\n        try {\n            Thread.sleep(5000);\n        } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String toString() {\n        return this.command;\n    }\n}\n\nIn this example, we create a pool of 5 threads using the Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5) method. We then submit 10 tasks to the pool using the execute method. The tasks will be executed in the order they are submitted.\nThe pool will then shut down when all the tasks have been executed. You can use the isTerminated method to check if the pool has shut down.\n"}
