A token is a piece of a string that satisfies a specified condition. The StringTokenizer class has two constructors. The first constructor takes a string and a delimiter as parameters. The second constructor takes a string, a delimiter, and a flag as parameters. The flag is used to specify whether the delimiter is to be included in the tokens or not.\n\n"}
