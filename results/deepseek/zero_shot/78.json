The XML parser will not be able to parse the XML if you send a null character.  If you want to send a null character, you need to encode it as a character entity.  For example, if you want to send a null character as the string \"&amp;#0;\" you would need to use the following code:\nString tosend = \"&amp;#0;\";\n\nIf you want to send a null character as the string \"&amp;#0;\" you would need to use the following code:\nString tosend = \"&amp;#0;\";\n\nIf you want to send a null character as the string \"&amp;#0;\" you would need to use the following code:\nString tosend = \"&amp;#0;\";\n\nIf you want to send a null character as the string \"&amp;#0;\" you would need to use the following code:\nString tosend = \"&amp;#0;\";\n\nIf you want to send a null character as the string \"&amp;#0;\" you would need to use the following code:\nString tosend = \"&amp;#0;\";\n\nIf you want to send a null character as the string \"&amp;#0;\" you would need to use the following code:\nString tosend = \"&amp;#0;\";\n\nIf you want to send a null character as the string \"&amp;#0;\" you would need to use the following code:\nString tosend = \"&amp;#0;\";\n\nIf you want to send a null character as the string \"&amp;#0;\" you would need to use the following code:\nString tosend = \"&amp;#0;\";\n\nIf you want to send a null character as the string \"&amp;#0;\" you would need to use the following code:\nString tosend = \"&amp;#0;\";\n\nIf you want to send a null character as the string \"&amp;#0;\" you would need to use the following code:\nString tosend = \"&amp;#0;\";\n\nIf you want to send a null character as the string \"&amp;#0;\" you would need to use the following code:\nString tosend = \"&amp;#0;\";\n\nIf you want to send a null character as the string \"&amp;#0;\" you would need to use the following code:\nString tosend = \"&amp;#0;\";\n\nIf you want to send a null character as the string \"&amp;#0;\" you would need to use the following code:\nString tosend = \"&amp;#0;\";\n\nIf you want to send a null character as the string \"&amp;#0;\" you would need to use the following code:\nString tosend = \"&amp;#0;\";\n\nIf you want to send a null character as the string \"&amp;#0;\" you would need to use the following code:\nString tosend = \"&amp;#0;\";\n\nIf you want to send a null character as the string \"&amp;#0;\" you would need to use the following code:\nString tosend = \"&amp;#0;\";\n\nIf you want to send a null character as the string \"&amp;#0;\" you would need to use the following code:\nString tosend = \"&amp;#0;\";\n\nIf you want to send a null character as the string \"&amp;#0;\" you would need to use the following code:\nString tosend = \"&amp;#0;\";\n\nIf you want to send a null character as the string \"&amp;#0;\" you would need to use the following code:\nString tosend = \"&amp;#0;\";\n\nIf you want to send a null character as the string \"&amp;#0;\" you would need to use the following code:\nString tosend = \"&amp;#0;\";\n\nIf you want"}
