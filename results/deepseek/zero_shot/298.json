A naive approach is this:List<String> strings = Arrays.asList(\"s0\", \"s1\", \"s2\", \"s3\", \"s4\");Consumer<String> c0 = s -> System.out.println(\"c0.accept(\" + s + \")\");Consumer<String> c1 = s -> System.out.println(\"c1.accept(\" + s + \")\");strings.stream().skip(0).peek(c0).skip(1).peek(c1).findAny();This produces the following output:c0.accept(s0)c0.accept(s1)c1.accept(s1)I understand that it's because s0 will enter the stream, encounter skip(0), then peek(c0) (which gives the the first line) and then skip(1), which will skip this element and then apparently continue with the next element from the beginning of the stream.I thought I could use these consumers to extract the strings, but c0 would be overwritten by the second element:String[] extracted = new String[2];c0 = s -> extracted[0];c1 = s -> extracted[1];EDIT:These are the characteristics of the stream:There's a stream only, not a list or an arrayThe stream is possibly infiniteThe stream can be made sequential\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Collect certain elements from stream: :How can I extract two elements from a Stream by their positions?
