A token is a part of a string that satisfies some criteria. The StringTokenizer class allows an application to break a string into tokens.\nThe StringTokenizer class has two constructors. The first constructor takes a string and a delimiter. The second constructor takes a string, a delimiter, and a flag. The flag is used to specify whether the delimiter should be included in the resulting tokens.\nThe nextToken() method returns the next token from this string tokenizer.\nThe hasMoreTokens() method returns true if there are more tokens in this string tokenizer.\nThe countTokens() method returns the number of tokens in this string tokenizer.\nThe StringTokenizer class is useful for breaking a string into tokens.
