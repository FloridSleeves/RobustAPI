The Timer class is used to schedule the TimerTask to run every second (1000 milliseconds). The TimerTask is responsible for writing the last modified time to the text file.\n\nA: I think you should use File.lastModified() to get the last modified time of the file.\nFile file = new File(\"C:\\\\Users\\\\user\\\\Desktop\\\\test.txt\");\nlong lastModified = file.lastModified();\n\n"}
