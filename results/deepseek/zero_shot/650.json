I've created a hashtable. Hashtable <String, Objects> ht;Could someone show how you'd write a comparator for a Hashtable? the examples i've seen overide equals and everything but i simply dont have a clue. The code below is not mine but an example i found, the key thing in hashtables means i cant do it like this i guess.    public class Comparator implements Comparable<Name> {        private final String firstName, lastName;        public void Name(String firstName, String lastName) {            if (firstName == null || lastName == null)                throw new NullPointerException();        this.firstName = firstName;            this.lastName = lastName;        }        public String firstName() { return firstName; }        public String lastName()  { return lastName;  }        public boolean equals(Object o) {            if (!(o instanceof Name))                return false;            Name n = (Name)o;            return n.firstName.equals(firstName) &&                   n.lastName.equals(lastName);        }        public int hashCode() {            return 31*firstName.hashCode() + lastName.hashCode();        }        public String toString() {        return firstName + \" \" + lastName;        }        public int compareTo(Name n) {            int lastCmp = lastName.compareTo(n.lastName);            return (lastCmp != 0 ? lastCmp :                    firstName.compareTo(n.firstName));        }    }\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Hashtable comparator problem: :Hi guys i've never written a comparator b4 and im having a real problem.
