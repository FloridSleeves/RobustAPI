A token is a sequence of characters that are delimited by a specified set of delimiters. In this case, the delimiters are the commas. The StringTokenizer class has a method called nextToken() that returns the next token in the string. The while loop iterates through the tokens and stores each one in a variable called word. The code then does something with the word, such as adding it to an array or printing it to the console.\n\n"}
