I have a method called endOfTurn which is called when the player wants to finish their turn, It sets the 'currentPlayerTurn' field to the next player in the Map. However once I reach the end of my map i want it to go back to the first player in the map and go round again and again. Is there a way of doing this? Also yes the players data structure does need to be a map!public class Game {private Map<String,Player> players;private Player currentPlayerTurn;public boolean EndOfTurn(Player currentPlayerTurn) {    //need to set this.currentPlayerTurn to the next player in the Map}I have looked into using an iterator but this doesnt seem to have a reset function or a 'loop around' mode. Any ideas?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Need a way of continuously looping/iterating around a Map: :I am building a game in java and I have a 'Map' of Player objects.

In this case, it returns the next Player object in the Map.\nThe while loop checks if there is a next element in the iteration using the hasNext() method. If there is a next element, the next element is retrieved using the next() method and stored in the player variable.\nThe if statement checks if the currentPlayerTurn variable is equal to the player variable. If they are equal, the if statement checks if there is a next element in the iteration using the hasNext() method. If there is a next element, the next element is retrieved using the next() method and stored in the currentPlayerTurn variable. If there is no next element, the first element in the iteration is retrieved using the iterator.next() method and stored in the currentPlayerTurn variable.\nThe break statement is used to exit the while loop once the currentPlayerTurn variable has been set.\n"}
