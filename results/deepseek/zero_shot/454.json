I currently have it filed with random numbers within the correct range, but I just cant think of a solution to have non duplicates. How could i do this using very basic java methods? I have not yet learned anything such as arraylists, or anything like that, only the very basic methods. \nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to fill a 2D array with random non duplicate numbers in Java: :I'm having a hard time figuring out how to fill my 2D array with random numbers without duplicates.
