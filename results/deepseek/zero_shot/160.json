However, often i find writing partial mocks time consuming, and it does not feel 'right'.I'd say its a design fault as my class I try to mock has multiple concerns into one, therefore I should create seperate classes in order to seperate concerns.What do you think? Is partially mocking a good or bad thing? And, if good/bad, why?
