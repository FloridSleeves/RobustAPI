The tokenization process is the process of breaking a string into smaller units called tokens. The StringTokenizer class is used to tokenize a string.

The tokenization process is the process of breaking a string into smaller units called tokens.\n\nA: I think you are looking for the String.split() method.\nString[] parts = str.split(\";\");\n\nThis will split the string on the ; character.\n"}
