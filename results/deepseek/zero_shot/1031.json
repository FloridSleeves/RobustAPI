The tokens are used to parse the string. The StringTokenizer class is found in the java.util package. The StringTokenizer class has two constructors. The first constructor takes a string and a delimiter. The second constructor takes a string, a delimiter, and a flag. The flag is used to specify whether the delimiter is to be included in the tokens or not. The delimiter is the character or string that is used to break the string into tokens. The delimiter is specified as a string. The delimiter can be a single character or a string. The delimiter can be a single character or a string. The delimiter can be a single character or a string.
