Any advice on the best way to do this is appreciated.\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer: Yes, you can change the type of stream you're using without closing and reopening the socket in Java.\nHere's an example of how you can do it:\nimport java.io.DataOutputStream;\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.net.Socket;\n\npublic class SocketExample {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        try {\n            // Create a socket and connect to the server\n            Socket socket = new Socket(\"localhost\", 12345);\n\n            // Create a DataOutputStream to send data to the server\n            DataOutputStream out = new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());\n\n            // Send a text command to the server\n            out.writeUTF(\"INFO\");\n\n            // Send an object to the server\n            out.writeObject(new MyObject());\n\n            // Close the socket\n            socket.close();\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nIn this example, we create a socket and connect to the server. We then create a DataOutputStream to send data to the server. We send a text command \"INFO\" to the server using the writeUTF method of the DataOutputStream. We then send an object to the server using the writeObject method of the DataOutputStream. Finally, we close the socket.\nNote that you can also use the PrintWriter class to send text commands to the server, and the ObjectOutputStream class to send objects to the server.\n"}
