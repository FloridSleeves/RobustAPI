In your code, you are calling the next() method on the CStickChart Iterator, which returns the next CStick in the iteration. However, you are not doing anything with the returned CStick, so it is not being used in your code.\nTo get the next CStick in the iteration, you need to call the next() method on the Iterator returned by the CStickChart.iterator() method. You can then use the returned CStick to access its EPIC value.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.hasNext.\nAnswer: The Iterator.hasNext() method returns true if the iteration has more elements. In your code, you are using the Iterator.hasNext() method to check if there are more CSticks in the iteration. However, you are not doing anything with the returned boolean value.\nTo check if there are more CSticks in the iteration, you need to call the hasNext() method on the Iterator returned by the CStickChart.iterator() method. You can then use the returned boolean value to determine if there are more CSticks in the iteration.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.remove.\nAnswer: The Iterator.remove() method removes from the underlying collection the last element returned by the iterator (optional operation). In your code, you are using the Iterator.remove() method to remove the last CStick returned by the Iterator. However, you are not doing anything with the returned boolean value.\nTo remove the last CStick returned by the Iterator, you need to call the remove() method on the Iterator returned by the CStickChart.iterator() method. You can then use the returned boolean value to determine if the CStick was successfully removed.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.forEachRemaining.\nAnswer: The Iterator.forEachRemaining() method performs the given action for each remaining element until all elements have been processed or the action throws an exception. In your code, you are using the Iterator.forEachRemaining() method to iterate through the CSticks in the iteration. However, you are not doing anything with the CSticks.\nTo iterate through the CSticks in the iteration, you need to call the forEachRemaining() method on the Iterator returned by the CStickChart.iterator() method. You can then use the CSticks to access their EPIC values.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.forEachRemaining.\nAnswer: The Iterator.forEachRemaining() method performs the given action for each remaining element until all elements have been processed or the action throws an exception. In your code, you are using the Iterator.forEachRemaining() method to iterate through the CSticks in the iteration. However, you are not doing anything with the CSticks.\nTo iterate through the CSticks in the iteration, you need to call the forEachRemaining() method on the Iterator returned by the CStickChart.iterator() method. You can then use the CSticks to access their EPIC values.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.forEachRemaining.\nAnswer: The Iterator.forEachRemaining() method performs the given action for each remaining element until all elements have been processed or the action throws an exception.
