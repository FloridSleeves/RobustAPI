It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Content-Disposition file extension not properly working on Firefox: :I have the following code on Spring Controller @RequestMapping(value = \"/download\", method = RequestMethod.POST) public void downloadActive(@RequestParam(value = \"type\") String offerType, HttpServletResponse response,            HttpSession session) throws Exception { StringBuilder b = new StringBuilder();...response.addHeader(\"Content-Disposition: \", \"attachment; filename=my\" + offerType + \"Offers.csv\");response.getWriter().write(b.toString());..}This code get executed when a download button from EXt Js is clicked. On chrome, it directly downloads the file as a *.csv format and when the user opens it, it will use Excel automatically to open the file, if they already have installed and this is the right behavior I wanted to have.However, on firefox, it prompts a save as window with open with and save options. If I use open with option, it tells me the filename is filename.csv but the type is chrome htm file. I haven't mentioned htm anywhere in my code and I dont know why its trying  to open it as htm instead of csv file. Once it tries to open it, it brings excel application and the contents are in a bad format.Is there a way to avoid this problem on firefox ?Thanks\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem.
