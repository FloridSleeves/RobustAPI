It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Removing the BOM character with Java: :This question already has answers here:                                                            Byte order mark screws up file reading in Java                                (11 answers)                            Closed 8 years ago.I am trying to read files using FileReader and write them into a separate file.These files are UTF-8 encoded, but unfortuantely some of them still contain a BOM.The relevant code I tried is this:private final String UTF8_BOM = \"\\uFEFF\"; private String removeUTF8BOM(String s)    {        if (s.startsWith(UTF8_BOM))        {            s=s.replace(UTF8_BOM, \"\");        }        return s;    }    line=removeUTF8BOM(line);But for some reason the BOM is not removed. Is there any other way I can do this with FileReader? I know that there is the BOMInputStream that should work, but I'd rather find a solution using FileReader.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Android InputStream.read() horribly slow:I'm working on an Android app that needs to communicate with a server (running on my PC) which is also written by me.

It is meant for reading streams of characters, such as FileReader, InputStreamReader, and StringReader. It reads text from a character-input stream, buffering characters so as to provide for the efficient reading of characters, arrays, and lines.\nQuestion: How to get the current time in milliseconds in Java: :This question already has answers here:                                                            How to get current time in milliseconds in Java                                (10 answers)                            Closed 1 year ago.I need to get the current time in milliseconds in Java.
