I wrote objects at various locations in the file. The objects were of variable sizes but all of the same class.Now I want to read from such a file. I dont want to have to specify the number of bytes to read. I want to be able to read the object directly using Object Input Stream. How to achieve this ? I have to use Random Access Files because I need to write to different positions in file. I am also recording in a separate data structure, the locations where objects have been written.\nPlease using this api: FileChannel.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileChannel.write\n<<<code>>>: while(rbb.hasRemaining()) {\n        try{\n            fileChannel.writeLong(recordBytes.length);\n            fileChannel.write(rbb);\n        } catch {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");}\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The simplest solution that comes to mind is to write out the length of the array before writing out the array itself. When reading the object, you first read the length. This'll tell you how many further bytes to read to get your object. Similarly to what you are already doing on the writing side, you could read the data into a byte[] and then use ByteArrayInputputStream and ObjectInputStream.\nQuestion: How to send file name and file content using socket channel: :i want to send file name and file content together using socketchannel.i have tried to convert file name to bytes, wrap those bytes in a bytebuffer, then send those buffer contents to the client (this is on the server side).on the client side, i have tried to loop through the contents in the buffer, convert the bytes to characters and check the presence of a special character to note the end of the file name. when that character is identified, i call the buffer method compact() so that i can now start reading the contents. but this isn't working! my client side first while loop while(bb.hasRemaining()) isn't breaking and no character is printed  from this loop!!Server sideFileChannel sbc;    ServerSocketChannel ssc=null;    SocketChannel clientchannel=null;try {  ssc=ServerSocketChannel.open(); ssc.bind(new InetSocketAddress(5002)); clientchannel=ssc.accept();String filename=f.getName()+\"?\";  byte[] nameinbytes=filename.getBytes(\"UTF-8\");System.out.println(\"name of file to send: \"+filename);ByteBuffer namebuffer=ByteBuffer.wrap(nameinbytes);clientchannel.write(namebuffer);                sbc=FileChannel.open(f.toPath());                 ByteBuffer buff=ByteBuffer.allocate(10000000);                 int bytesread=sbc.read(buff);                 double read=(double)bytesread;                 while(bytesread != -1){                read+=(double) bytesread;                buff.flip();               clientchannel.write(buff);                buff.clear();                System.out.println(\"current position: \"+sbc.position());                bytesread=sbc.read(buff);                 }  System.out.println(\"file data written\");client sideSocketAddress address=new InetSocketAddress(InetAddress.getLocalHost(),5002);     clientChannel=SocketChannel.open(address);     ByteBuffer bb=ByteBuffer.allocate(10000000);     int bytesRead=clientChannel.read(bb);     String filename=\"\";     while(bb.hasRemaining()){         byte bm=bb.get();         char c=(char)(bm & 0xFF);         System.out.println(c);         if(c != '?'){             filename+=Character.toString(c);         }else{             bb.compact();             break;         }     }      File file=new File(\"C:\\\\Users\\\\C-I-C\\\\Desktop\\\\fromclient\\\\\"+filename);     bout =new FileOutputStream(file);      sbc=bout.getChannel();     while(bytesRead != -1){       bb.flip();       sbc.write(bb);       bb.clear();      bytesRead=clientChannel.read(bb);     }     System.out.println(\"received: \"+filename);QHow can i send both filename and file contents using the same channel?\nPlease using this api: FileChannel.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Reading Objects from Random Access File: I wrote a file using Java's FileChannel class that uses RandomAccessFiles.
