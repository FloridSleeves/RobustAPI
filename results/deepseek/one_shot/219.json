It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: How can I copy a wav file from one directory to another in java?: :In my program, I have used an adaptation of an example in the documentation for the JSch package that describes how to copy files from a remote server to the local machine.
