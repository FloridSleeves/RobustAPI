It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Reading and Handling Streams: :I want to read and handle a stream of String containing single OR multiple commands in one line.I am currently using InputStream in = socket.getInputStream(); for my inputstream.Also for handling the input a typical Thread:public void run() {    String input = \"\";    try {        int data = 0;        while (!isInterrupted()) {            while ((data = in.read()) != -1 && !isInterrupted()) {                input += Integer.toHexString(data);                handleInput(input);            }            try {                sleep(500);            } catch (InterruptedException e) {                break;            }        }        socket.close();        return;    } catch (IOException e) {        main.log(\"Connection lost...\");        main.log(e.toString());        main.stopBTCommunication();        main.startBTServer();    }}handleInput() is designed to handle any String given to it and response correctly. The problem with this implementation would be, that handleInput() is called with every byte read from in.read().
