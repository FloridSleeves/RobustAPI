But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: How to make a save button: :I am trying to make a save button but I don't know how to do it. I will explain a little bit about my program. When someone start the program it shows a JOptionPane and the user need to write a nickname and then when he clicks on OK button it saves his nickname in a text.file.
