I am confused how does it work? why doesn't it give error just like we get in java code? and most importantly, how does environment decide to which component it needs to invoke? I understand the process of id generation is automated, which gets added to R.java For instance, if we have same IDs, say \"image1\" in two XMLs, say \"layout1\" & \"layout2\". but in R.java it won't have 2 IDs. that means at a time it will reference only 1 component. In case we have to use 2 XMLs in an Activity, one as activity.setcontentview(layout1) and another as a PopupWindow.setContentView(layout2).
