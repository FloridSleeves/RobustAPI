Yes, I am a dolt. Please don't answer with a reference to that document. What I am specifically interested in is how to dynamically add rows and columns to my Jtable via the Netbeans IDE. I already have an object that contains a hashmap with my data. I can't figure out where or what object I should be passing that object to. Thanks for your time! I have a vector that contains a series (of length l) of objects (each one corresponding to a row).
