Can you help me with this?\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Map.get\n<<<code>>>: import java.util.HashMap;import java.util.Map;Map<String, Integer> freq = new HashMap<String, Integer>();Integer count = freq.get(word);if (count == null) {freq.put(word, 1);}else {freq.put(word, count + 1);}\n<<<explanation>>>: If you look at the API for Map, get operations usually return null when the map does not contain the requested element. Note that this will make a solution.\nQuestion: Bug casting String, Integer, Double using HashMap: :I have some strange bug on Android 2.3 and lower.I have following code:HashMap<Somekey, Object> data = new HashMap<Somekey, Object>();data.put(somekey, \"asdfdsafdsf\");String value = (String) data.get(somekey);on the last line I have ClassCastException: get(somekey) returns Boolean value instead of String. This error appears not only with String type, with Integer and Double too.I don't understand why, because this code correctly works on android 4.0.3 and higher.\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to increment a Map value in Java: Say I'm creating a word frequency list, using a Map (probably a HashMap), where each key is a String with the word that's being counted and the value is an Integer that's incremented each time a token of the word is found.
