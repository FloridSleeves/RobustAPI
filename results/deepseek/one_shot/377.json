The OrientDB contains one unique node with the property \"SPECIAL-NODE\". I want to query the database for this node and print it out. I have one line of code that works using an iterator (see below) and one that does not (below at bottom). It seems like both should work yet only the first does, the second does not. Why is this the case?Thanks!// create Orient graph object and connect to database, works successfullyOrientGraph ograph = new OrientGraph(\"remote:localhost/test\", \"username\", \"password\");// this WORKS - finds the one special node and prints it outIterator<Vertex> i =ograph.getVertices(\"SPECIAL-NODE\", \"SPECIAL\").iterator();System.out.println(i.next());// this DOES NOT WORK.
