I am confused how does it work? why doesn't it give error just like we get in java code? and most importantly, how does environment decide to which component it needs to invoke? I understand the process of id generation is automated, which gets added to R.java For instance, if we have same IDs, say \"image1\" in two XMLs, say \"layout1\" & \"layout2\". but in R.java it won't have 2 IDs. that means at a time it will reference only 1 component. In case we have to use 2 XMLs in an Activity, one as activity.setcontentview(layout1) and another as a PopupWindow.setContentView(layout2). What will happen in such case?\nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Activity.setContentView\n<<<code>>>: @Override\npublic void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n    Button myButton = (Button) findViewById(R.id.my_button);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You can findViewById of the current view hierarchy set to the activity. You cannot have same id for the view's in the same view tree. (must be unique).\nQuestion: How to create in Android Java a random number between min and max excluding some numbers that fall between min and max.?: :How to create in Android Java a random number between min and max excluding some numbers that fall between min and max.?I have three vars, each is a random number between 1-100. I was able to do the random number using the math.rand() but I am trying to make sure that the three numbers do not match. I did a work around using while and if statements, but I was looking to see if there is a one line of command to do this, so that I can put it right under th activity class so that it's public var. and in that area (activity) I can't use while and if statements, I only can in onCreate due to the void or something. Thank you in advance for your help, and will vote for any help or idea that will lead to finding any info about this. \nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: I have defined several layouts, where few id's are multiple defined.
