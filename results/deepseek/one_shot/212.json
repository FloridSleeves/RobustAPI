It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Any byte >= 128 is received as 65533: :I am implementing a server on Android and I am using:while (!Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) {    try {        int r;        String response = \"\";        while ((r = input.read()) > 0) {        ...        }    ...}I have two issues. If the client sends me a byte of value 0, it is not received by the server. The second issue is, if the byte value is 128 or more, I keep receiving a value of 65533 or a binary value of 11111101. Anyone knows how to solve these issues.
