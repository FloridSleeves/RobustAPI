It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Replicating C struct padding in Java: :According to here, the C compiler will pad out values when writing a structure to a binary file. As the example in the link says, when writing a struct like this:struct { char c; int i;} a;to a binary file, the compiler will usually leave an unnamed, unused hole between the char and int fields, to ensure that the int field is properly aligned. How could I to create an exact replica of the binary output file (generated in C), using a different language (in my case, Java)?Is there an automatic way to apply C padding in Java output? Or do I have to go through compiler documentation to see how it works (the compiler is g++ by the way).\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Android InputStream.read() horribly slow:I'm working on an Android app that needs to communicate with a server (running on my PC) which is also written by me.
