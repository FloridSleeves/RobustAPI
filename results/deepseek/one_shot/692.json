It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Reading a File versus Writing One: :This question is not specific question, but more a general question. For reading a file I know you can use Scanner and read it and then print it. However reading a file and then printing it in a new format, like double space, indents, basically any spacing issues, is that also considered reading it or is it writing it? From my understanding of what my teacher has taught me, is that writing overwrites the original document and replaces it. Also how does one use the PrintWriter command? I have never seen this before in my class nor have read about it in my textbook but its on my test according to my teacher. Could someone give an explanation and an example about it? I read this site http://www.caveofprogramming.com/frontpage/articles/java/java-file-reading-and-writing-files-in-java/ on writing files, but it uses FileWriter, which I'm assuming takes the place of scanner?
