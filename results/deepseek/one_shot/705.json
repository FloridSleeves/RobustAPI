One is a username and the other a password. to \"login\", the program will search through a file --> accounts.txt  and will search first for \"usrnm:\", once it finds it, it takes the word right after the :the same goes for the password but it searches for \"pswrd:\".Here's what iv'e got so far:    public void checkCredentials() {    try {        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(new File(\"accounts.txt\")));        String text = br.readLine();        text = text.toLowerCase();        text.split(\"usrnm:\");        System.out.println(\"username: \" + userInput);    } catch (Exception ex) {        ex.printStackTrace();    }}any help is appreciated!\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem.
