The initial test codes worked like a charm, but wasn't flexible enought to send messages from different parts of my application. So I've rewrite the code in a way that all objects that has a reference to Servlet object could send a message to the clients:public class PushServlet extends HttpServlet {    private Thread threadServlet;    private boolean processando=true;    private MensagemSSEBean mensagem;    @Override    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {        threadServlet=Thread.currentThread();        response.setContentType(\"text/event-stream; charset=utf-8\");        while (processando){            if(!pausarThread())                break;            enviarMensagemParaOCliente(response.getWriter());        }        enviarMensagemDeFechamento(response.getWriter());    }    private void enviarMensagemParaOCliente(PrintWriter saida) {        ConversorMensagemSSE conversor = new ConversorMensagemSSE();        saida.print(conversor.converter(mensagem));        saida.flush();    }    private synchronized void enviarMensagemDeFechamento(PrintWriter saida) {        mensagem.setMensagem(\"#FECHAR_CONEXAO#\");        enviarMensagemParaOCliente(saida);        saida.close();    }    public synchronized void enviarMensagem(MensagemSSEBean mensagem) throws IOException {        this.mensagem=mensagem;        threadServlet.notifyAll();    }    public synchronized void finalizar(){        processando=false;    }    private boolean pausarThread() {        try {            threadServlet.wait();            return true;        } catch (InterruptedException e) {            e.printStackTrace();          }        return false;    }}As you can see, I pause the Servlet Thread until something call \"enviarMensagem\".
