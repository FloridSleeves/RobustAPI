File displayed with all options can you suggest how to make the temp file as not modified and even it is not able to save to another location. I need this file only displayed at run time of the program. During that time user does not change any content and it could not be save as  another location.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n\nThe problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though. To fix this, you need to add a line break character at the end of the string you are writing. In this case, it should be a newline character \"\\n\".\n\nFor your second question, you cannot set a file as read-only after it has been created. When a file is created, it is not read-only by default. If you want to make the file read-only, you need to delete the original file and create a new read-only file. However, you cannot create a new file with the same name as the original file, as it will be overwritten.\n\nTo achieve what you want, you can create a new file with a unique name and set its read-only attribute. Here's an updated version of your code that creates a new file with a unique name and sets its read-only attribute:\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.Random;\n\npublic class GreetingServiceImpl implements GreetingService {\n    @Override\n    public String getGreeting(String name) {\n        return \"Hello \" + name + \"!\";\n    }\n\n    public String getText() {\n        ApplicationContext appContext = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(new String[]{\"spring-config-server.xml\"});\n        Resource resource = appContext.getResource(\"file:D:\\\\text\\\\test.txt\");\n        StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();\n        try {\n            InputStream is = resource.getInputStream();\n            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(is));\n            File temp = File.createTempFile(\"output\", \".txt\");\n            String filePath = temp.getAbsolutePath();\n            System.out.println(\"\" + filePath);\n            String tempName = temp.getName();\n            String line;\n            PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(temp));\n            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n                out.println(line);\n            }\n            temp.setReadOnly();\n            String[] cmd = {\"notepad\", temp.getAbsolutePath()};\n            Runtime runtime = Runtime.getRuntime();\n            Process proc = runtime.exec(cmd);\n            out.close();\n            br.close();\n            temp.delete();\n            return builder.toString();\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n        return builder.toString();\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this updated code, we create a new file with a unique name using `File.createTempFile(\"output\", \".txt\")`. We then set the read-only attribute of the file using `temp.setReadOnly()`. Finally, we execute the `notepad` command to open the file in Notepad and display it at runtime."}
