USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem. That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: PrintWriter not appending content in the right order: :I have a list that contains objects (whose constructor contains another inner object). When I'm trying to print the list to a file, I go through each object and call the object's respective writer methods.public void writer(String file, boolean append) {    File path = new File(\"../Opdracht6_2/src/\" + file);    try {        PrintWriter write = new PrintWriter(new FileOutputStream(path,                append));        for (SuperObject o : this.list) {            if (o instanceof Object1) {                ((subObject1) w).writer1(file);            }            if (o instanceof Object2) {                ((subObject3) w).writer2(file);                            }if (o instanceof Object3) {                ((subObject3) w).writer3(file);                            }        }        write.close();    } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {        // TODO Auto-generated catch block        e.printStackTrace();    }}In the object's writer method I try to first print a line which says what type it is and then call the writer method for the innerobject. After that I want current object's arguments to be printed and than it goes back to the lists writer methodpublic void writer1(String file) {    File path = new File(\"../Opdracht6_2/src/\" + file);    try {        PrintWriter write = new PrintWriter(                new FileOutputStream(path, true));        //below is the string I want to print before the innerobject appends         //its own arguments to the file        write.append(\"String\\r\\n\");        this.innerobject.innerwriter();        write.append(this objects arg);        write.close();    } catch (IOException e) {        // TODO Auto-generated catch block        e.printStackTrace();    }}The innerobject's writerpublic void innerwriter(String file) {    File path = new File(\"../Opdracht6_2/src/\" + file);    try {        PrintWriter write = new PrintWriter(                new FileOutputStream(path, true));        write.append(this objects arg);        write.close();    } catch (IOException e) {        // TODO Auto-generated catch block        e.printStackTrace();    }}Now the thing that is actually happening is that the line that I'm trying to append first gets appended after the innerobject's arguments even though I have put it before the method that calls the innerobject's writer.It looks like this then in the file:inner objects argstringouter objects argCan someone explain why?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\\r\\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n\nThe issue with your code is that you are not adding a line break character (`\\r\\n`) after the string \"1\" when you write it to the file. This is causing the inner object's writer method to be called before the line that you want to appear before it in the file. To fix this, you should add a line break character after the string \"1\" when you write it to the file.\n\nHere is an updated version of your code that should work as expected:\n```scss\ntry {\n    printWriter.write(\"1\\r\\n\");\n    printWriter.write(\"2\\r\\n\");\n    printWriter.write(\"3\\r\\n\");\n} catch (Exception e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n```\nThis will write the strings \"1\", \"2\", and \"3\" to the file, each on a separate line. When you read the file with BufferedReader, you should see the lines \"1\", \"2\", and \"3\" in the order that they were written to the file."}
