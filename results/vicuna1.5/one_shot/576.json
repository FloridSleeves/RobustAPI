Try to just use the value of the foreach inside the loop.\nQuestion: Iteration through data structures(queue, stacks, bags): :Queue<Transaction> collection = new Queue<Transaction>andfor(Transaction t: collection){ StdOut.println(t); }From my understanding of objects, it looks like we just created an object, the queue, of datatype transaction(type parameter) and collection is the reference to that object. Correct? Then the second bit of code is what confuses me. We are looping to print whats in the queue but i'm not sure i understand how this works. collection points to the Queue of type Transaction. It looks like we are creating a reference t to the object Transaction and doing something with it to the reference collection. Pretty confused.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: for(Iterator<Transaction> it = collection.iterator(); it.hasNext(); ){\ni = i + 1;\nnames.add(it.next().getValue(String.class));\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: Yes, that's correct. You're creating a new iterator for the queue every time the loop iterates, which means you're creating a new reference to the first element of the queue every time. Instead, you should use the iterator's next() method to get the next element in the queue in each iteration of the loop."}
