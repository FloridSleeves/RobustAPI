It's worked great until we recently realized that some of the commands I send are getting cut off at 1955 characters. The way everything is set up is that I send the server 1 line commands and it sends back 1 line responses. I can't figure out a way to send longer commands via DataOutputStream through the TelnetClient.

You can't send a single string longer than 1955 characters in a single write operation. Instead, you need to split the string into smaller chunks and write each chunk separately.\n\nIn your code, you can modify the write method to split the command string into smaller chunks and write each chunk separately using the DataOutputStream.write method. You can use a loop to write the chunks until the entire command string has been written.\n\nHere's an example of how you can modify the write method to split the command string into smaller chunks:\n```java\nprivate void write(String command) throws IOException {\n    int chunkSize = 1955;\n    int chunkIndex = 0;\n    while (chunkIndex < command.length()) {\n        int endIndex = chunkIndex + chunkSize;\n        if (endIndex > command.length()) {\n            endIndex = command.length();\n        }\n        String chunk = command.substring(chunkIndex, endIndex);\n        dataOutputStream.writeBytes(twoHyphens + boundary + lineEnd);\n        dataOutputStream.writeBytes(\"Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"command\\\"\\\"; filename=\\\"\\\"\\\"; content-type=\\\"text/plain\\\"\\n\" + lineEnd);\n        dataOutputStream.writeBytes(chunk);\n        dataOutputStream.writeBytes(lineEnd);\n        chunkIndex = endIndex;\n    }\n}\n```\nThis modified write method will split the command string into smaller chunks of size 1955 characters and write each chunk separately to the output stream. This should allow you to send longer commands without being cut off."}
