I went through this way: Preferences -> Java -> Compiler -> Errors / Warnings -> Deprecated and Restricted API. Then i changed errors to warnings. But now i can not use that library efficient, cause eclipse suggest me nothing about that library.My first question is; if there is a better way to do that? Or maybe another way to use this library efficient in eclipse?EDIT: I found out it was a complication of 32 and 64 bit versions. After installing 32bit JDK and reference the jai_imageio.jar it worked fine.And second; Can anybody give a plain example to me about converting .bmp image to jpeg2000 image. That would help a lot to me about undesrtanding the context.Thank you\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: for(Iterator<DataSnapshot> it = dataSnapshot.getChildren().iterator(); it.hasNext(); ){\ni = i + 1;\nnames.add(it.next().getValue(String.class));\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You're creating a new dataSnapshot.getChildren().iterator() in every iteration of your loop. Try to just use the value of the foreach inside the loop.\n\nRegarding your second question, converting a .bmp image to a .jpeg2000 image can be done using the Java Advanced Imaging (JAI) library. Here's a simple example:\n\n<<<api>>>: com.sun.media.imageio.plugins.J2KImageWriter\n<<<code>>>: J2KImageWriter jw = new J2KImageWriter();\njw.setImageWriterProperties(new ImageWriterProperties(new File(\"output.j2k\")));\njw.write(new BufferedImage(1, 1, BufferedImage.TYPE_INT_RGB), \"input.bmp\");\n\nThis example reads an input .bmp image and writes it to an output .j2k file using the J2KImageWriter class. The output file is specified using the ImageWriterProperties class. The input image is assumed to be a 1x1 pixel image of type BufferedImage.TYPE\\_INT\\_RGB. You may need to adjust the code based on your specific use case."}
