Try to just use the value of the foreach inside the loop.\nQuestion: Recursive Enumeration in Java: :I still have a question about Enumerations. Here's a quick sketch of the situation.I have a class Backpack that has a Hashmap content with as keys a variable of type long, and as value an ArrayList with Items. I have to write an Enumeration that iterates over the content of a Backpack. But here's the catch: in a Backpack, there can also be another Backpack. And the Enumeration should also be able to iterate over the content of a backpack that is in the backpack. (I hope you can follow, I'm not really good at explaining..)Here is the code I have:public Enumeration<Object> getEnumeration() {    return new Enumeration<Object>() {        private int itemsDone = 0;        //I make a new array with all the values of the HashMap, so I can use        //them in nextElement()        Collection<Long> keysCollection = getContent().keySet();                    Long [] keys = keysCollection.toArray(new Long[keysCollection.size()]);        public boolean hasMoreElements() {            if(itemsDone < getContent().size()) {                return true;            }else {                return false;            }        }        public Object nextElement() {                           ArrayList<Item> temporaryList= getContent().get(keys[itemsDone]);            for(int i = 0; i < temporaryList.size(); i++) {                if(temporaryList.get(i) instanceof Backpack) {                    return temporaryList.get(i).getEnumeration();                                       }else {                    return getContent().get(keys[itemsDone++]);                }            }        }    };Will this code work decently? It's just the \"return temporaryList.get(i).getEnumeration();\" I'm worried about. Will the users still be able to use just the hasMoreElemens() and nextElement() like he would normally do?Any help is appreciated,Harm De Weirdt\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: for(Iterator<DataSnapshot> it = dataSnapshot.getChildren().iterator(); it.hasNext(); ){\ni = i + 1;\nnames.add(it.next().getValue(String.class));\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: Your code looks good, but you can simplify it by removing the iterator creation inside the loop and just using the iterator from the loop's foreach.\n\nRegarding your question about recursive enumeration, your code looks correct. The user should be able to use the hasMoreElements() and nextElement() methods as expected. The hasMoreElements() method will return true as long as there are more elements to return, and the nextElement() method will return the next element in the enumeration.\n\nThe part where you return the temporaryList.get(i).getEnumeration(); is where the recursion happens. This will return the enumeration for the elements inside the Backpack at the current index of the keys array.\n\nJust make sure that the getEnumeration() method of the Item class is implemented correctly to return the enumeration for its children."}
