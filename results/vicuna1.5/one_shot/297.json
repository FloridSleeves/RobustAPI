Try to just use the value of the foreach inside the loop.\nQuestion: Java for each, but multiple iterator types?: :I have a class Polygon on which I wish to implement two iterators: one to run through all elements (vertices and edges in alternating order) just ONCE, and another to run through them ad infinitum (cyclically).From a for-each usage standpoint, my guess is that I am only going to be able to have one of the above be the default iterator that can be used with for-each, via implementation of Iterable.iterator(). Is this correct? Or is there a way I could use for-each with both?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: for(Iterator<Object> it = polygon.iterator(); it.hasNext(); ){\nif(it.next() instanceof Vertex){\n    // handle vertices\n}else if(it.next() instanceof Edge){\n    // handle edges\n}\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You can use the Iterator.next() method to check the type of the next element in the iterator and handle it accordingly. In this case, you can check if the next element is a Vertex or Edge and handle them accordingly."}
