{"api": "PrintWriter.write", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem. That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Can we use PrintWriter Class for saving a string in a file in an Android App? If yes, then how?: :If we can use PrintWriter Class in making an Android App, then what is the mistake in the following code? My app stops working on pressing the button 'save'public void save(View view)    {        text=data.getText().toString();        PrintWriter writer=null;        try {            writer=new PrintWriter(filename);        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {            msg.setText(\"FileNotFoundException\");            }        writer.print(text);        writer.flush();        writer.close();        msg.setText(\"Data Saved Successfully\");    }}\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(filename); writer.write(text); writer.flush(); writer.close(); } catch (FileNotFoundException e) { msg.setText(\"FileNotFoundException\"); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The code is trying to write the string \"text\" to a file specified by the filename variable. The PrintWriter class is used to write the data to the file. The write() method is used to write the data to the file. The flush() method is used to ensure that the data is written to the file immediately. The close() method is used to close the PrintWriter object and the file. The catch block is used to handle the FileNotFoundException that may occur if the file specified by the filename variable does not exist."}
