{"api": "Activity.findViewById", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to pause / sleep thread or process in Android?: I want to make a pause between two lines of code, Let me explain a bit:\n-> the user clicks a button (a card in fact) and I show it by changing the background of this button:\nthisbutton.setBackgroundResource(R.drawable.icon);\n-> after let's say 1 second, I need to go back to the previous state of the button by changing back its background:\nthisbutton.setBackgroundResource(R.drawable.defaultcard);\n-> I've tried to pause the thread between these two lines of code with:\ntry {\n    Thread.sleep(1000);\n} catch (InterruptedException e) {\n    // TODO Auto-generated catch block\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\nHowever, this does not work. Maybe it's the process and not the Thread that I need to pause?\nI've also tried (but it doesn't work):\nnew Reminder(5);\nWith this:\npublic class Reminder {\n        Timer timer;\n        public Reminder(int seconds) {\n            timer = new Timer();\n            timer.schedule(new RemindTask(), seconds*1000);\n        }\n\n        class RemindTask extends TimerTask {\n            public void run() {\n                System.out.format(\"Time's up!%n\");\n                timer.cancel(); //Terminate the timer thread\n            }\n        }  \n    }\nHow can I pause/sleep the thread or process?\nPlease using this api: Activity.findViewById.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Activity.findViewById\n<<<code>>>: private static class MyHandler extends Handler {}\nprivate final MyHandler mHandler = new MyHandler();\npublic static class MyRunnable implements Runnable {\n    private final WeakReference<Activity> mActivity;\n    public MyRunnable(Activity activity) {\n        mActivity = new WeakReference<>(activity);\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void run() throws Exception {\n        Activity activity = mActivity.get();\n        if (activity != null) {\n            Button btn = (Button) activity.findViewById(R.id.button);\n            btn.setBackgroundResource(R.drawable.defaultcard);\n        }\n    }\n}\nprivate MyRunnable mRunnable = new MyRunnable(this);\npublic void onClick(View view) {\n    my_button.setBackgroundResource(R.drawable.icon);\n    // Execute the Runnable in 2 seconds\n    mHandler.postDelayed(mRunnable, 2000);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: A more complex solution that avoids the memory leak subclasses the Handler and Runnable with static inner classes inside the activity since static inner classes do not hold an implicit reference to their outer class.\nQuestion: Function to change TextView doesn't work when called from another class: :I've written a function to change the text of a TextView. It's in the class of the activity which contains the TextView. However, this function doesn't work when it's called from another class.The function looks like this:public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {    public void changeTest() {        TextView test = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.textViewTest);        guessedLetters.setText(\"test\");    }}If I call this function from my MainActivity, it works perfectly fine:public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {    @Override    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);        setContentView(R.layout.activity_gameplay);        changeTest();    }}But if I call it from a class that extends MainActivity, I get a java.lang.NullPointerException at android.app.Activity.findViewById(Activity.java:1884).public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {    @Override    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);        setContentView(R.layout.activity_gameplay);        MyClass myClass = new MyClass();        myClass.myFunction();    }}public class MyClass extends MainActivity {    public void myFunction() {        MainActivity mainActivity = new MainActivity();        mainActivity.changeTest();    }}How could I fix this?\nPlease using this api: Activity.findViewById.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Activity.findViewById\n<<<code>>>: You can use the context of the current class to call the function instead of using the context of the activity.\nYou can pass the context of the current class as a parameter to the function and use it to call the function on the UI thread.\nYou can also use the runOnUiThread() method to run the function on the UI thread.\n<<<explanation>>>:\nYou can pass the context of the current class as a parameter to the function and use it to call the function on the UI thread.\nYou can also use the runOnUiThread() method to run the function on the UI thread.\nYou can also use the View.post() method to post the function to the UI thread.\nYou can also use the Handler class to post the function to the UI thread."}
