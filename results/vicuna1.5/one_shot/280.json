Try to just use the value of the foreach inside the loop.\nQuestion: Java 8 Stream, getting head and tail: :Java 8 introduced a Stream class that resembles Scala's Stream, a powerful lazy construct using which it is possible to do something like this very concisely:def from(n: Int): Stream[Int] = n #:: from(n+1)def sieve(s: Stream[Int]): Stream[Int] = {  s.head #:: sieve(s.tail filter (_ % s.head != 0))}val primes = sieve(from(2))primes takeWhile(_ < 1000) print  // prints all primes less than 1000I wondered if it is possible to do this in Java 8, so I wrote something like this:IntStream from(int n) {    return IntStream.iterate(n, m -> m + 1);}IntStream sieve(IntStream s) {    int head = s.findFirst().getAsInt();    return IntStream.concat(IntStream.of(head), sieve(s.skip(1).filter(n -> n % head != 0)));}IntStream primes = sieve(from(2));Fairly simple, but it produces java.lang.IllegalStateException: stream has already been operated upon or closed because both findFirst() and skip() are terminal operations on Stream which can be done only once.I don't really have to use up the stream twice since all I need is the first number in the stream and the rest as another stream, i.e. equivalent of Scala's Stream.head and Stream.tail. Is there a method in Java 8 Stream that I can use to achieve this?Thanks.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Java 8 Stream\n<<<code>>>: for(Iterator<DataSnapshot> it = dataSnapshot.getChildren().iterator(); it.hasNext(); ){\ni = i + 1;\nnames.add(it.next().getValue(String.class));\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You're creating a new dataSnapshot.getChildren().iterator() in every iteration of your loop. Try to just use the value of the foreach inside the loop.\n\nRegarding your second question, you can use the `head` and `tail` methods of the Java 8 Stream class to get the first and rest of the elements in the stream respectively.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n<<<api>>>: Java 8 Stream\n<<<code>>>: IntStream primes = sieve(from(2));\nprimes.skip(1).forEach(System.out::println);\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The `sieve` method returns an IntStream, which is a stream of integers. The `skip(1)` method skips the first element of the stream, and the `forEach` method prints the rest of the elements in the stream. The `System.out::println` is a method reference that prints the element to the console."}
