USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Android InputStream.read() horribly slow:I'm working on an Android app that needs to communicate with a server (running on my PC) which is also written by me. The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: ByteArrayInputStream#read() strange behaviour for negative input bytes: :I faced with this code in test.byte[] bytes = new byte[] { -1, 1, 0x0 }; InputStream in = new ByteArrayInputStream(bytes); System.out.println(in.read() + in.read() + in.read());I expected that this code returns 0 (-1+1+0) but it returns 256.I am very wondered.Who can explain this bahaviour?P.S.Revealed that the first statement returns 255. Why?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: int b1 = in.read();\nint b2 = in.read();\nint b3 = in.read();\nint result = b1 + b2 + b3;\n<<<explanation>>>: The behavior you are observing is due to the fact that the `read()` method of the `ByteArrayInputStream` class reads a single byte from the input stream and returns it as an integer value. If the input stream contains negative values, such as `-1`, it is interpreted as a byte value of 255 in the Java programming language. Therefore, when you read a byte array with negative values, the `read()` method reads each byte as a single integer value and returns the sum of these integers, which can be 256 in this case. To read the bytes as individual bytes, you can use the `read(byte[] b)` method of the `InputStream` class, which reads a specified number of bytes from the input stream and stores them in the specified byte array."}
