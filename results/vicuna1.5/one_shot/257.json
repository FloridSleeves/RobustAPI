You can use it to iterate through the rows and cells of a workbook, and extract the data you need. In the code above, you can use the `getRowIterator()` and `getCellIterator()` methods to iterate through the rows and cells of a workbook, respectively. You can then use the `hasNext()` method to check if there are more rows or cells to iterate through, and the `next()` method to get the next row or cell. You can use the `getCellType()` method to check the type of each cell, and the `getValue()` method to get the value of a cell that is of type `CellType.STRING`."}
