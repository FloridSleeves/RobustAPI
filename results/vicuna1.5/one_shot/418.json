Try to just use the value of the foreach inside the loop.\nQuestion: How to remove minimum item from data array in Java?: :I am working on a homework assignment in which I need to write a method that takes a data array and removes the minimum item from it.  I am able to find the minimum item, but I am having trouble removing it.  My code is below.  public Comparable removeMin() {    Iterator<T> it = iterator();    T min = it.next();    while (it.hasNext()) {        T next = it.next();        if (min.compareTo(next) > 0)            min = next;        it.remove();    }    System.out.println(min);    return min;}I have the print statement there just to verify that it is in fact getting the minimum item.  The code in main looks like this.public static void main(String[] args) {  Bag<String> sbag = new Bag<String>();    sbag.add(\"Noriko\");    sbag.add(\"Peter\");     sbag.add(\"Buddy\");    sbag.add(\"Mary\");    sbag.removeMin();  }When I run the sbag.removeMin(); command, the console prints \"Buddy\" which tells me that it is choosing \"Buddy\" as the min item.  However, if I instead populate sbag with integers, it always prints the smallest integer, which indicates to me I have my code correct in that regard.I have two questions.1). When passing a list of strings such as above, how does Java determine which is smallest?2). How can I fix my code so that it not only finds the minimum item, but also removes it?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: for(Iterator<T> it = sbag.iterator(); it.hasNext(); ){\n    T min = it.next();\n    while (it.hasNext()) {\n        T next = it.next();\n        if (min.compareTo(next) > 0) {\n            min = next;\n        }\n        it.remove();\n    }\n    System.out.println(min);\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>:\n\n1. When passing a list of strings such as above, Java uses the String's compareTo() method to determine which is the smallest. This method compares two strings lexicographically (alphabetically).\n2. To fix your code, you need to store the minimum item in a separate variable and remove it from the list in each iteration of the loop. The code provided above does this by storing the minimum item in the variable 'min' and removing it from the list in the while loop."}
