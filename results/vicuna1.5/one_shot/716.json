{"api": "PrintWriter.write", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem. That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Appending .txt file is erasing everything: :import java.io.FileWriter;import java.io.PrintWriter;public class DemoPrint {    public static void main (String args []) {        try{            PrintWriter coolFile = new PrintWriter(\"c:\\\\JavaIO\\\\cool.txt\");            FileWriter file = new FileWriter(\"c:\\\\JavaIO\\\\cool.txt\", true);            coolFile.println(\"Why isn't this adding another line?\");            coolFile.close();        }        catch (Exception e) {            System.out.println(\"Error\");        }}    }So I'm new to programming/java and I'm trying to open this file and append the data and add another line but for some reason the data is just being erased and overwritten with whatever I have in the coolFile.println(\"\").Can anyone help me out on this? I know its probably a easy fix... I'm learning.. Thank you!\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though. To fix this, you need to add a line break character at the end of the string you are writing. In this case, it should be \"\\n\" for a new line."}
