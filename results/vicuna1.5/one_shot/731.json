But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Writing CSV file. myPackage.MyClass cannot be cast to java.lang.CharSequence: :I need to write List<MyClass> myList into CSV file. In particular I need to write values. MyClass has the following implementation:public class MyClass {    private Object[] values;//...    @Override    public String toString()       {        String line = \"\";        for (int i=0; i<this.getSize(); i++) {            //if (this.values[i] != null) {                line = line + this.values[i] + \" \";            //}        }        return line;     }}The code is the following:private void saveSolutionToCSV(List<MyClass> solution) {    int columnSize = solution.get(0).getSize();    try {      FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(\"test.csv\");      Iterator result = solution.iterator();      while(result.hasNext()) {         for(int i = 0; i < columnSize; i++) {            CharSequence element = (CharSequence)result.next();             writer.append(element);            if(i < columnSize - 1)             writer.append(',');         }         writer.append('\\n');      }    }    catch(Exception e)    {      e.printStackTrace();    }}And the error message is the following:java.lang.ClassCastException: myPackage.MyClass cannot be cast to java.lang.CharSequenceHow to solve this problem? Thx.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n\nThe problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\n\nTo fix this, you can add a line break character at the end of each line you write with PrintWriter.write().\n\nFor example:\n```\nprintWriter.write(\"1\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\\n\");\n```\nAlso, you need to make sure that the class that you are trying to write to CSV file implements the `CharSequence` interface or one of its subclasses, otherwise you will get a `ClassCastException`.\n\nIn your case, you can change the implementation of `MyClass` to implement `CharSequence` interface like this:\n```\npublic class MyClass implements CharSequence {\n    private Object[] values;\n\n    @Override\n    public int length() {\n        return values.length;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public char charAt(int index) {\n        if (index < values.length) {\n            return values[index].toString().charAt(0);\n        }\n        return '\\0';\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public CharSequence subSequence(int start, int end) {\n        return new String(values, start, end - start);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String toString() {\n        String line = \"\";\n        for (int i = 0; i < values.length; i++) {\n            if (values[i] != null) {\n                line = line + values[i] + \" \";\n            }\n        }\n        return line;\n    }\n}\n```\nAnd then you can use the following code to write the list of MyClass objects to a CSV file:\n```\nprivate void saveSolutionToCSV(List<MyClass> solution) {\n    int columnSize = solution.get(0).length();\n    try {\n        FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(\"test.csv\");\n        Iterator<MyClass> result = solution.iterator();\n        while(result.hasNext()) {\n            for(int i = 0; i < columnSize; i++) {\n                CharSequence element = result.next();\n                writer.append(element);\n                if(i < columnSize - 1)\n                    writer.append(',');\n            }\n            writer.append('\\n');\n        }\n    } catch(Exception e) {\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    }\n}\n```\nThis should solve the problem and allow you to write the list of MyClass objects to a CSV file."}
