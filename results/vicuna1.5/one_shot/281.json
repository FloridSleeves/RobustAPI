Try to just use the value of the foreach inside the loop.\nQuestion: Java.lang.AssertionError in a SortedArrayList: :So I'm making an Contact Manager App in Android. My professor send us a JUnit test so we can know if our code is working correctly. Now every method has passed the test except the iterator test which fails the test. It appears to be a java.lang.AssertionError and I cant seem to figure out a way of fixing it. If you could see the error and point it out to me would be awesome. Thanks in advance\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: It seems like you're using a SortedArrayList in your code, and the error is occurring when you try to access the Iterator.next() method. The issue might be that the SortedArrayList does not support the Iterator.next() method, or it might be that the list is not sorted properly. To fix the issue, you can try using a different data structure that supports the Iterator.next() method, or you can ensure that the list is sorted properly before using it in your code.\n\nExplanation: The SortedArrayList does not support the Iterator.next() method, so you cannot use it to iterate through the list. Instead, you can try using a different data structure such as an ArrayList or a LinkedList, which both support the Iterator.next() method. Additionally, make sure that the list is sorted properly before using it in your code, as the Iterator.next() method only works for sorted lists."}
