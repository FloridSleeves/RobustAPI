USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem. That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Modify contents of text file and write to new file in java: :So I've got the basic code for this however due to the while loop I'm using, I can really only write the last line of the text file to the new file. I'm trying to modify the text from testfile.txt and write it to a new file named mdemarco.txt. The modification I'm trying to do is add a line number in front of each line. Does anybody know a way to maybe write the contents of the while loop to a string while it runs and output the resulting string to mdemarco.txt or anything like that?public class Writefile{public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException{  try  {     Scanner file = new Scanner(new File(\"testfile.txt\"));     File output = new File(\"mdemarco.txt\");     String s = \"\";     String b = \"\";     int n = 0;     while(file.hasNext())     {        s = file.nextLine();        n++;        System.out.println(n+\". \"+s);        b = (n+\". \"+s);     }//end while     PrintWriter printer = new PrintWriter(output);     printer.println(b);     printer.close();  }//end try     catch(FileNotFoundException fnfe)  {     System.out.println(\"Was not able to locate testfile.txt.\");  }}//end main}//end classThe input file text is:doremefa solatedoAnd the output I'm getting is only8. doCan anybody help?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { PrintWriter printer = new PrintWriter(output); printer.println(b); printer.close(); } catch (FileNotFoundException fnfe) { System.out.println(\"Was not able to locate testfile.txt.\"); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The issue is that you are modifying the string b inside the while loop, but you are not writing it to the output file until after the loop has finished. To fix this, you can move the line that creates the PrintWriter object and writes the string to the output file outside of the while loop, so that it can write the modified string to the file after the loop has finished. Additionally, you should add a catch block to handle the FileNotFoundException that may be thrown if the output file cannot be found."}
