{"api": "PrintWriter.write", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem. That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Response encoding of Google App Engine (can not change response encoding): :public class FeedUpdaterServlet extends HttpServlet {public void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp)        throws IOException {    PrintWriter out = resp.getWriter();    req.setCharacterEncoding(\"utf-8\");    resp.setLocale(Locale.TAIWAN);    resp.setContentType(\"text/html; charset=utf-8\");    resp.setCharacterEncoding(\"utf-8\");    resp.getWriter().println(\"Hello, world!!@!\");            out.println(\"\u6211\u662f\u4eba\");  //some chinese character    out.println(resp.getCharacterEncoding());    out.flush();    out.close();  }}web xml<locale-encoding-mapping-list>        <locale-encoding-mapping>            <locale>zh_TW</locale>            <encoding>utf-8</encoding>        </locale-encoding-mapping>    </locale-encoding-mapping-list>Output:Hello, world!!@! ??? ISO-8859-1It seems that the encoding of the respond can not be changed, what is happening???\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\n\nRegarding the second question, it seems that the response encoding cannot be changed because the web.xml file has a locale-encoding-mapping-list element with a locale-encoding-mapping element that specifies the encoding as \"ISO-8859-1\" for the \"zh\\_TW\" locale. This means that the response will always be encoded in \"ISO-8859-1\" for requests with a \"zh\\_TW\" locale. To fix the issue, you can either change the encoding in the locale-encoding-mapping-list element to \"utf-8\" or change the locale of the request to something other than \"zh\\_TW\"."}
