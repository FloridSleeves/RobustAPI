{"api": "PrintWriter.write", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem. That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: using for loop write lines one by one in file using java: :                                It's difficult to tell what is being asked here.

Closed 10 years ago.for(i=0;i<10;i++){    String output = output + \"Result \"+ i +\" : \"+ ans +\"\\n\";   //ans from other logic    FileWriter f0 = new FileWriter(\"output.txt\");    f0.write(output);}but it doesn't work,please give some help for append or PrintWriter method, i have no idea how to use these methods.i need file output likeResult 1 : 45           //here 45 is ansResult 2 : 564856Result 3 : 879....Result 10 : 564thanks\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"Result \" + i + \" : \" + ans + \"\\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are trying to write the output to a file using a for loop and FileWriter, but you are not closing the file writer after writing to it. Also, you are not providing a line break between \"Result \" and \" : \" in your write statement. Try closing the file writer after writing to it and providing a line break between \"Result \" and \" : \" in your write statement."}
