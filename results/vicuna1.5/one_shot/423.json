Try to just use the value of the foreach inside the loop.\nQuestion: How do I refer to the previous and next element during an iteration?: :When I have a for loop, I use the i to refer to the elements of my array, objects, etc.  Like:Current item: myArray[i]Next item: myArray[i+1]Previous item: myArray[i-1] But at the moment, I'm using a foreach loop ( for (Object elem : col) { ).How do I refer to the previous item?(I need to do a search an 'array', which I'm doing with for (Object object : getComponents()).  But when it returns true (so it finds what I look for), it should perform the code on the previous and the next item.  Clarification: I have java.awt.Component elements!\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: for (Iterator<Object> it = col.iterator(); it.hasNext(); ) {\nint i = 0;\nObject current = it.next();\nif (current instanceof java.awt.Component) {\n// Perform code on current component\n}\nif (i > 0) {\nObject previous = it.previous();\n// Perform code on previous component\n}\nif (i < col.size() - 1) {\nObject next = it.next();\n// Perform code on next component\n}\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You can use the Iterator.next() and Iterator.previous() methods to refer to the current and previous elements during an iteration. In your case, you can store the current and previous components in separate variables and perform the necessary code on them."}
