However, since it takes around 3 seconds to complete, i don't just want the screen sitting and waiting for 3 seconds showing nothing. I would like it to display a ProgressDialog. I've tried everything in these threads and while most do 2 / 3, none seem to do all 3.Basically I have a button that when pressed, i want to parse the xml file and then use the data parsed from the file:void onButtonClicked() {    ProgressDialog pd = new ProgressDialog(this);    pd.setMessage(\"Parsing...\");    pd.show();    String[] ret;    return = parseXmlFile();    pd.dismiss();    if (ret[0] == \"steve\") {       sayHiToSteve();    }}  If I use an asyncTask, it will continue on with execution and check ret[0] before the task is completed and will just be null.if i do AsyncTask.get(), it pauses the execution but doesn't display the progress dialog, so that's no good either. I also looked at creating a seperate thread, but i had the same problem. I can't use a timer, because it is about 3 seconds (but can be up to 4 or 5 seconds if connection is slow), so i can't approximate. Any help is much appreciated.Thanks in advance.\nPlease using this api: ProgressDialog.dismiss.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: ProgressDialog.dismiss\n<<<code>>>: if (progressDialog != null &&  progressDialog.isShowing()) {progressDialog.dismiss();}\n<<<explanation>>>: Try this.\n\nIt seems like you want to show a ProgressDialog while parsing the XML file and then dismiss it after the file is parsed. To achieve this, you can use the `AsyncTask` class to perform the XML parsing in a separate thread. Here's an example of how you can modify your code:\n```java\nprivate class ParseXmlTask extends AsyncTask<Void, Void, String[]> {\n    @Override\n    protected String[] doInBackground(Void... params) {\n        // Perform XML parsing here\n        String xmlString = \"<your XML string>\";\n        DocumentBuilderFactory dbFactory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();\n        DocumentBuilder dBuilder = dbFactory.newDocumentBuilder();\n        Document doc = dBuilder.parse(new InputSource(new StringReader(xmlString)));\n        // XPath expression to get the data you need\n        String xpath = \"//your XPath expression\";\n        String[] ret = new String[1];\n        ret[0] = getDataFromXPath(doc, xpath);\n        return ret;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onPostExecute(String[] result) {\n        if (progressDialog != null && progressDialog.isShowing()) {\n            progressDialog.dismiss();\n        }\n        if (result != null && result.length > 0) {\n            // Use the data parsed from the file here\n            sayHiToSteve();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nvoid onButtonClicked() {\n    ProgressDialog pd = new ProgressDialog(this);\n    pd.setMessage(\"Parsing...\");\n    pd.show();\n    ParseXmlTask task = new ParseXmlTask();\n    task.execute();\n}\n```\nIn this example, I created an `AsyncTask` called `ParseXmlTask` that performs the XML parsing in the `doInBackground()` method. In the `onPostExecute()` method, you can check if the `result` array is not null and has at least one element before calling `sayHiToSteve()`. This way, you can show the ProgressDialog and dismiss it after the XML parsing is completed, and then use the parsed data."}
