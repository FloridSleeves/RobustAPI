(Android)I'm having trouble with the following implementation:Server grabs bitmap -> raw bytes -> TCP -> Client (Async StreamsNow the byte array is delivered in multiple packets of different lengths in the client. So to handle this properly, I should use the prefix method.To use prefix mode you need to send the length of the message in bytes  as four bytes and then the messageMy codepublic void sendScreenshot(byte[] buffer) throws IOException {    OutputStream os = socket.getOutputStream();    os.write(buffer.length + 1);    os.write((byte) 0);    os.write(buffer, 0, buffer.length);    os.flush();}In VB.net, this is achieved in the following code:Private Sub dat(ByVal dat As String)    Dim nstream As NetworkStream = sock.GetStream()    Dim bit As Byte() = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(dat)    Dim bw As New BinaryWriter(sock.GetStream())    bw.Write(bit.Length + 1)    bw.Write((byte)command)    bw.Write(bit, 0, bit.length)End SubAny help implementing it in Java is welcome?\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: DataOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>: private void sendScreenshot(byte[] buffer) throws IOException {\nDataOutputStream dataOutputStream = new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());\ndataOutputStream.writeInt(buffer.length);\ndataOutputStream.write(buffer);\ndataOutputStream.flush();\n}\n\nExplanation:\nTo implement prefix mode in Java, you can use the `DataOutputStream` class to write the length of the message in bytes as a 4-byte integer, followed by the message itself. The `writeInt()` method can be used to write the length, and the `write()` method can be used to write the message. The `flush()` method can be used to ensure that the data is written to the stream."}
