Try to just use the value of the foreach inside the loop.\nQuestion: Find all numbers that appear in each of a set of lists: :I have several ArrayLists of Integer objects, stored in a HashMap.I want to get a list (ArrayList) of all the numbers (Integer objects) that appear in each list.My thinking so far is:Iterate through each ArrayList and put all the values into a HashSet This will give us a \"listing\" of all the values in the lists, but only onceIterate through the HashSet 2.1 With each iteration perform ArrayList.contains()  2.2 If none of the ArrayLists return false for the operation add the number to a \"master list\" which contains all the final values.If you can come up with something faster or more efficient, funny thing is as I wrote this I came up with a reasonably good solution. But I'll still post it just in case it is useful for someone else.But of course if you have a better way please do let me know.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: for(Iterator<DataSnapshot> it = dataSnapshot.getChildren().iterator(); it.hasNext(); ){\ni = i + 1;\nnames.add(it.next().getValue(String.class));\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You're creating a new dataSnapshot.getChildren().iterator() in every iteration of your loop. Try to just use the value of the foreach inside the loop.\n\nFor your second question, you can use a HashSet to keep track of the numbers that appear in each list. Here's an example of how you can do it:\n\n<<<api>>>: HashSet\n<<<code>>>: for(Iterator<DataSnapshot> it = dataSnapshot.getChildren().iterator(); it.hasNext(); ){\nif(it.next().getValue(Integer.class) != null) {\nHashSet<Integer> numbers = new HashSet<>();\nnumbers.add(it.next().getValue(Integer.class));\n}\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: Iterate through each ArrayList and put all the values into a HashSet. If the value is not null, add it to the HashSet. Finally, you can iterate through the HashSet and perform ArrayList.contains() to check if the number appears in any of the lists. If none of the ArrayLists return false for the operation, add the number to a \"master list\" which contains all the final values."}
