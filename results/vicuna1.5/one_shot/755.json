USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem. That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Java streaming Properties over Socket: :First of all, this is a homework problem. That being said, I'm stuck. Googling for java Properties over Sockets results in a lot of irrelevant things. I'm trying to transfer a Properties object over a socket. The API says it can be done with a Stream or a Writer/Reader, but I can't get it to work. I can do it manually, that is, if I read the file line by line and pass it through a PrintWriter.On the client side I've got roughly:socket = new Socket(host, port);outStream = socket.getOutputStream();out = new PrintWriter(outStream, true);in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file));...props.load(reader);props.store(out, null);On the server side the receiving bits look like:out = new PrintWriter(sock.getOutputStream(), true);inStream = sock.getInputStream();in = new BufferedReader( new InputStreamReader(inStream));...props.load(in); // hangs// doesn't get to code here...In this case it hangs at the props.load(in). Instead of doing props.load(in), I read it in line by line to make sure props.store(out, null) was working, and the data looks like its being transferred.Is there something about load/store I don't understand, or is it an issue with the Stream/Writer/Reader?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break.
