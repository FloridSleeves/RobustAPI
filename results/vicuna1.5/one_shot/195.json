USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Android InputStream.read() horribly slow:I'm working on an Android app that needs to communicate with a server (running on my PC) which is also written by me. The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Reading Strings and Binary from the same FileInputStream: :I have a file that contains some amount of plain text at the start followed by binary content at the end. The size of the binary content is determined by some one of the plain text lines I read.I was using a BufferedReader to read the individual lines, however it exposes no methods to refer to read a byte array. The readUTF for a DataInputStream doesnt read all the way to the end of the line, and the readLine method is deprecated.Using the underlying FileInputStream to read returns empty byte arrays. Any suggestions on how to go about this?private DOTDataInfo parseFile(InputStream stream) throws IOException{DOTDataInfo info = new DOTDataInfo();BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(stream));int binSize = 0;String line;while((line = reader.readLine()) != null){    if(line.length() == 0)        break;    DOTProperty prop = parseProperty(line);    info.getProperties().add(prop);    if(prop.getName().equals(\"ContentSize\"))        binSize = Integer.parseInt(prop.getValue());}byte[] content = new byte[binSize];stream.read(content); //Its all empty now. If I use a DataInputStream instead, its got the values from the filereturn info;}\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>:\nbyte[] content = new byte[binSize];\nint bytesRead = stream.read(content);\nif (bytesRead == -1) {\nthrow new IOException(\"Failed to read binary data from file\");\n}\nreturn content;\n\n<<<explanation>>>: Instead of reading each byte individually, you can use the `InputStream.read()` method to read a specific number of bytes. In this case, you can read the `binSize` number of bytes from the file and store it in the `content` array. If the number of bytes read is less than `binSize`, you can throw an exception to indicate that the file is corrupted or not in the expected format."}
