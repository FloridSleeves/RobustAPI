I am fetching the application info using below code. For example to check whether google maps is installed or not, I am using its package name as shown below.         ApplicationInfo info1 = getPackageManager().        getApplicationInfo(\"com.google.android.apps.maps\", 0 );My question is , if at all this package name is changed by google in future, I will have to update the package name and then send an update to users... Other than checking from package name - Is there any other way to get to know if an application is installed or not? Kindly Help! Thanks!  \nPlease using this api: ApplicationInfo.loadIcon.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: ApplicationInfo.loadIcon\n<<<code>>>: PackageManager packageManager = getPackageManager();\nString appName = applicationInfo.loadLabel(packageManager);\ntry{ Drawable appIcon = applicationInfo.loadIcon(packageManager);}\ncatch{System.out.println(\"Error\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: First get the instance of package manager, then get App name and App icon via ApplicationInfo instance.\nAnother way to check if an application is installed or not is by using the PackageManager's queryIntentActivities() method. This method returns a list of ActivityInfo objects for the intents that this application has registered to receive. You can check if the list is empty or not to determine if the application is installed or not."}
