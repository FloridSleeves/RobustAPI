USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Android InputStream.read() horribly slow:I'm working on an Android app that needs to communicate with a server (running on my PC) which is also written by me. The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: make a client server java application: :I am trying to make a Java application in a client/server way.The client is a GUI in SWT which displays data from the server. The server is connected to a database.Ok, sorry for that, it's a classic question I'm sure, but I don't know how to start.In a project I worked for they implemented a lot of magic with Proxy.newProxyInstance() to invoke the Glassfish server transparently.I don't want to use a Glassfish server. I just want something simple in plain Java. But the concept of proxies seems pretty cool.Do you have ideas or examples of such thing? How do I write the server part to handle the requests of clients?Thanks in advanceFluminis\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\nis.read(lengthBuffer);\nint length = (lengthBuffer[0] << 24) | (lengthBuffer[1] << 16) | (lengthBuffer[2] << 8) | lengthBuffer[3];\nfinal byte[] buffer = new byte[length];\nis.read(buffer);\nreturn buffer;\n}catch (IOException e){\nSystem.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: This code reads the first 3 bytes from the InputStream to get the length of the data to be read. Then it reads the data in a block of length and returns it. This way, you can avoid reading each byte individually and can take advantage of the optimizations provided by the InputStream for reading blocks of data. Also, you are not allocating a mega array like you were previously doing."}
