Try to just use the value of the foreach inside the loop.\n\nRegarding your second question, you can add additional parameters to a for loop by using the \"and\" operator \"&&\" in the condition. However, in your case, it seems that you want to add a condition inside the loop, which is not possible with the for loop. Instead, you can use a while loop and add the condition inside the loop.\n\n<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: for(Iterator<DataSnapshot> it = dataSnapshot.getChildren().iterator(); it.hasNext(); ){\ni = i + 1;\nnames.add(it.next().getValue(String.class));\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You're creating a new dataSnapshot.getChildren().iterator() in every iteration of your loop.
