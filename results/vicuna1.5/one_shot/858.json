{"api": "RandomAccessFile.read", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How do I read the last \"n\" bytes of a file in Java: How do I read the last n number of bytes from a file, without using RandomAccessFile. The last 6 bytes in my files contain crucial information when writing the files back. I need to write my original files, and then append the last 6 bytes elsewhere. Any guidance? Thanks\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: RandomAccessFile.read\n<<<code>>>: RandomAccessFile randomAccessFile = new RandomAccessFile(your_file, \"r\");randomAccessFile.seek(your_file.length() - n);try{randomAccessFile.read(byteArray, 0, n);} catch(IOException e) {e.printStackTrace();} \n<<<explanation>>>: You have to do it by using RandomAccessFile. Instances of this class support both reading and writing to a random access file. A random access file behaves like a large array of bytes stored in the file system. \nQuestion: Read file and split into multiple files: :I have a file which I would like to read in Java and split this file into n (user input) output files. Here is how I read the file:int n = 4;BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"file.csv\"));try {    String line = br.readLine();    while (line != null) {        line = br.readLine();    }} finally {    br.close();}How do I split the file - file.csv into n files?Note - Since the number of entries in the file are of the order of 100k, I can't store the file content into an array and then split it and save into multiple files.\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: RandomAccessFile.read\n<<<code>>>: RandomAccessFile randomAccessFile = new RandomAccessFile(\"file.csv\", \"r\");randomAccessFile.seek(0);while (randomAccessFile.read() != -1) {FileOutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream(\"output_\" + n + \".csv\");byteArray = new byte[1024];int bytesRead = randomAccessFile.read(byteArray, 0, 1024);if (bytesRead > 0) {outputStream.write(byteArray, 0, bytesRead);}outputStream.close();randomAccessFile.seek(randomAccessFile.getFilePointer() + bytesRead);}randomAccessFile.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: You can use the RandomAccessFile class to read the file and split it into n files. You can seek to the beginning of the file using the seek() method and then read the file byte by byte using the read() method. You can create an output stream for each file and write the bytes to the output stream. You can close the output stream after writing the bytes. You can also use the getFilePointer() method to keep track of the current position in the file and use it to seek to the next file."}
