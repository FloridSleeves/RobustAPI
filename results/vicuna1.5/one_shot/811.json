USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem. That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Unhandled JSP exception in Filter: :I have a filter configured for a JSP. In the filter I am using HTTPResponseWrapper for modifying the response to the user. My code in doFilter method of Filter is:CharArrayWrapper responseWrapper = new CharArrayWrapper(        (HttpServletResponse) response); chain.doFilter(request, responseWrapper);String responseString = responseWrapper.toString();System.out.println(\"responseString ********************* \"        + responseString);PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();out.write(responseString);The CharArrayWrapper class is:public class CharArrayWrapper extends HttpServletResponseWrapper {    private CharArrayWriter charWriter;    public CharArrayWrapper(HttpServletResponse response) {        super(response);        charWriter = new CharArrayWriter();    }    public PrintWriter getWriter() {        return (new PrintWriter(charWriter));    }    public String toString() {        return (charWriter.toString());    }    public char[] toCharArray() {        return (charWriter.toCharArray());    }}If the JSP for which the above filter is configured executes fine, there is no problem in the filter too and I can see the sysout on the console. On the other hand, when there is some unhandled exception raised in the JSP scriptlet code (its an old application) and I invoke chain.doFilter(request, responseWrapper);,  I get a NullPointerException. Is there any way by which I can know in my filter that there was an unhandled exception raised in the JSP\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\n\nTo fix the issue, you can add a line break character at the end of the string you are writing to the PrintWriter. You can use the \"\\n\" escape sequence for the line break character.\n\nHere's the modified code:\n\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n\nThis should output \"1\" when you receive it with the BufferedReader."}
