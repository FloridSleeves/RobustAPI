Try to just use the value of the foreach inside the loop.\nQuestion: How to cut Java for each loop in half?: :I'm working a lot with for each loops in Java. I'm using them to make every class of my objects to do \"drawing\", but it takes a lot of memory so I want to cut it in half, is there a way to do for each loop not for a full list?for(Tile tile: tiles){tile.draw();}I want to:for(Tile tile: (half of)tiles){    tile.draw();}is it possible or I just need to get lenght of tiles and when it reaches the number break the loop?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: for(Iterator<Tile> it = tiles.iterator(); it.hasNext(); ){\nif(it.next().drawingDone == false){\nit.next().draw();\nit.next().drawingDone = true;\n}\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You can use an iterator to iterate over a subset of the elements in the list. In your case, you can check if the current tile has been drawn or not and only call the draw method if it hasn't been drawn yet. This way, you can reduce the number of times the draw method is called and save memory."}
