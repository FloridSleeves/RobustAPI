The httpclient considers the whole of inputstream (including the trailer) as a singlechunk.   I've also tried writing the trailer in a response header after the data has been written to the outputstream but without success.Please helpI haven't found any good sources on this. \nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: DataOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>: private void writeTrailer(DataOutputStream dataOutputStream, String trailerName, String trailerValue) throws IOException {\ndataOutputStream.writeBytes(twoHyphens + boundary + lineEnd);\ndataOutputStream.writeBytes(trailerName + \": \" + trailerValue + lineEnd);\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: To send Http trailers/footers in a chunked response from within a Java servlet, you can use the `writeTrailer` method. This method writes the trailer name and value to the DataOutputStream, separated by a line break. The trailer name and value should be encoded in UTF-8. Make sure to call this method after writing the data to the Servlet outputstream and before sending the response. This will ensure that the trailer is sent separately from the data, allowing the HTTP client to properly parse the response."}
