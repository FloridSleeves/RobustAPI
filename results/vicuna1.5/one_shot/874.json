USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to query using SQLiteDatabase.query: How can I make query using SQLiteDatabase.query ?\n\n\"Select * from table where col1 = something AND col2 IS NOT NULL\"\nI tried it by putting the col2 with a =? in selection String and NOT NULL in selection argument but it doesn't work.\n\nPlease tell me where m going wrong.\n\nPlease using this api: SQLiteDatabase.query.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: SQLiteDatabase.query\n<<<code>>>: db.query(\"MyTable\", null,\n         \"col1 = ? AND col2 IS NOT NULL\",\n         new String[] { \"something\" },\n         null, null, null);\n         db.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: selectionArgs is an array of strings, and can be used only for string values.\n\nWhen you use col2 = ? with the string NOT NULL, you are telling the database to check if the column's value is the eight-character string \"NOT NULL\".\n\nYou must write col2 IS NOT NULL directly into the selection string:\nQuestion: Showing strings from a SQL file in java: :I have a SQL file with some data that I want to show in my app, the data will be shown in a list view.I want to include the SQL file in the apk.
