I Thing to set a virtual number for the max Player Count I can use the Method setMaxPlayers(int mxPlayers) from the ServerListPing Event. But what about the online Players? And does it also work if I try to get the Players via a query in a plugin?Thank you for your help and sorry for my bad English ;)\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: for(Iterator<DataSnapshot> it = dataSnapshot.getChildren().iterator(); it.hasNext(); ){\ni = i + 1;\nnames.add(it.next().getValue(String.class));\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You're creating a new dataSnapshot.getChildren().iterator() in every iteration of your loop.
