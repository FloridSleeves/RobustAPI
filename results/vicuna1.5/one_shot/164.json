USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Android InputStream.read() horribly slow:I'm working on an Android app that needs to communicate with a server (running on my PC) which is also written by me. The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Child Process will neither complete nor abort in Windows?: :How to make my java parent process wait till child process gets completed. I have tried with runtime.exec and with processBuilder.pb: String cmd = \"ffmpeg -i input.vob output.mp4\" Runtime rt = Runtime.getRuntime();Process proc = rt.exec(cmd); proc.waitFor();This works fine with small input file (say less than 10 Mb). If I give larger input file then program will be hanged. Output file will be partially created and file creation will be hanged and control will not return. Even proc.join(10000); did not give any useful result. Here parent process is terminating before child process (ffmpeg) gets completed.How to overcome this problem?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Process.waitFor()\n<<<code>>>: try {\nproc.waitFor();\n} catch (InterruptedException e) {\ne.printStackTrace();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The issue you are facing is because the child process is not terminating gracefully. The `waitFor()` method of the `Process` class will block the parent process until the child process completes or throws an exception. The `InterruptedException` you are catching is a common occurrence when waiting for a process to complete. To handle this, you can either catch the `InterruptedException` and retry the `waitFor()` method or use the `waitFor()` method's overloaded version that takes a timeout parameter, which will terminate the wait if the child process does not complete within the specified time."}
