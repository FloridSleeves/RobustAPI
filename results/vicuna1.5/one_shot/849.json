{"api": "RandomAccessFile.read", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How do I read the last \"n\" bytes of a file in Java: How do I read the last n number of bytes from a file, without using RandomAccessFile. The last 6 bytes in my files contain crucial information when writing the files back. I need to write my original files, and then append the last 6 bytes elsewhere. Any guidance? Thanks\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: RandomAccessFile.read\n<<<code>>>: RandomAccessFile randomAccessFile = new RandomAccessFile(your_file, \"r\");randomAccessFile.seek(your_file.length() - n);try{randomAccessFile.read(byteArray, 0, n);} catch(IOException e) {e.printStackTrace();} \n<<<explanation>>>: You have to do it by using RandomAccessFile. Instances of this class support both reading and writing to a random access file. A random access file behaves like a large array of bytes stored in the file system. \nQuestion: Gets the uncompressed size of this GZIPInputStream?: :I have a GZIPInputStream that I constructed from another ByteArrayInputStream. I want to know the original (uncompressed) length for the gzip data. Although I can read to the end of the GZIPInputStream, then count the number, it will cost much time and waste CPU. I would like to know the size before read it.Is there a similiar method like ZipEntry.getSize() for GZIPInputStream:public long getSize ()Since: API Level 1  Gets the uncompressed size of this ZipEntry.\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: RandomAccessFile.read\n<<<code>>>: RandomAccessFile randomAccessFile = new RandomAccessFile(your_file, \"r\");randomAccessFile.seek(0);try{randomAccessFile.read(byteArray, 0, 4);} catch(IOException e) {e.printStackTrace();}long uncompressedSize = ByteStreams.toLong(new ByteArrayInputStream(byteArray), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);\n<<<explanation>>>: You can use the `RandomAccessFile.read` method to read the first 4 bytes of the file, which represents the uncompressed size. Then, you can use the `ByteStream`s class to convert the byte array to a `ByteArrayInputStream` and then to a `Long` object, which represents the uncompressed size in bytes."}
