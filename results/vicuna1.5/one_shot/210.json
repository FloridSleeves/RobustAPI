USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Android InputStream.read() horribly slow:I'm working on an Android app that needs to communicate with a server (running on my PC) which is also written by me. The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Removing the BOM character with Java: :This question already has answers here:                                                            Byte order mark screws up file reading in Java                                (11 answers)                            Closed 8 years ago.I am trying to read files using FileReader and write them into a separate file.These files are UTF-8 encoded, but unfortuantely some of them still contain a BOM.The relevant code I tried is this:private final String UTF8_BOM = \"\\uFEFF\"; private String removeUTF8BOM(String s)    {        if (s.startsWith(UTF8_BOM))        {            s=s.replace(UTF8_BOM, \"\");        }        return s;    }    line=removeUTF8BOM(line);But for some reason the BOM is not removed. Is there any other way I can do this with FileReader? I know that there is the BOMInputStream that should work, but I'd rather find a solution using FileReader.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: byte[] bom = new byte[] {(byte) 0xFF, (byte) 0xFE};\nint bomLength = bom.length;\nInputStream is = new FileInputStream(\"file.txt\");\nis.skip(bomLength);\nis.read(line.getBytes());\nis.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem with your code is that you are not actually reading the BOM character from the file, you are just checking if it starts with it. To remove the BOM, you need to read the entire file and skip the BOM bytes before reading the rest of the file. The `skip()` method is used to skip a certain number of bytes, so you can use it to skip the BOM bytes. Then you can read the rest of the file using the `read()` method."}
