Try to just use the value of the foreach inside the loop.\nQuestion: Removing from an arraylist android: :I have an android game which involves a ship shooting enemies. I am trying to make it so that if the enemies are within a certain distance of the ammos, then the enemys remove themselves from the screen. I have attempted to do it and the code compiles, but i am unsure why the enemys arent being removed from the screen once been hit. Can anyone see anything wrong with the code below? Thankyoufor (TopEnemy i : newTopEnemy){    for (int q = 0; q < ammo.length; q++)    {       float xsubs = i.enemyX - ammo[q].positionX;       float ysubs = i.enemyY - ammo[q].positionY;       float squared = (xsubs * xsubs) + (ysubs * ysubs);       float distance = (float)Math.sqrt(squared);       if (distance < 10.0)       {          newTopEnemy.remove(q);       }    } }  \nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: for(Iterator<TopEnemy> it = newTopEnemy.iterator(); it.hasNext(); ){\ni = i + 1;\nnames.add(it.next().enemyX - ammo[q].positionX);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: It seems like you are trying to remove elements from the ArrayList while iterating over it. This will cause a ConcurrentModificationException. Instead, you should remove the element from the ArrayList after you are done using it in the iteration.\nAlso, you are using the variable i which is not defined in the scope of the for loop."}
