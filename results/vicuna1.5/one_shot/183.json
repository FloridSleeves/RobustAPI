USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Android InputStream.read() horribly slow:I'm working on an Android app that needs to communicate with a server (running on my PC) which is also written by me. The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Getting values of checkboxes along with uploading the file: :I was trying to upload an image in java using commonsIO  and Jar for file upload.But the problem am facing is that i am having two checkboxes on my form as follow : <div style=\"float:left\">  <input name=\"Mcheckbox\" type=\"checkbox\" value=\"Mobile\"/>  Mobile</div><div style=\"float:right\">  <input name=\"Echechkbox\" type=\"checkbox\" value=\"Email\"/>  Email</div>And then browse option : Upload Image : <INPUT TYPE=\"file\" NAME=\"file\" value=\"file\"></input>And in my servlet am doing something like this : ServletFileUpload upload = new ServletFileUpload(new DiskFileItemFactory());List<FileItem> files = new ServletFileUpload(new DiskFileItemFactory()).parseRequest(request);Iterator it = files.iterator();And then: while (it.hasNext()) {    FileItem fi = (FileItem) it.next();    if (fi.isFormField()) {        if (fieldname.compareTo(\"Mcheckbox\") == 0) {            System.out.println(\"checkbox value is \" + fieldvalue);            mymobilepass = fieldvalue;        } else if (fieldname.compareTo(\"Echeckbox\") == 0) {            System.out.println(\"checkbox value is \" + fieldvalue);            myemailpass = fieldvalue;        }    } else {        InputStream is = fi.getInputStream();        FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(path + \"\\\\\" + fi.getName());        int x = is.read();        while (x >= 0) {            fos.write((byte) x);            x = is.read();            //System.out.println(\"reading\");        }    }}But am getting null as the value of myemailpass or mymobilepass everytime.What can be the reason ? The if statement is never executed .Why ? Please help\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\nInputStream is = fi.getInputStream();\nint bytesRead = 0;\nwhile ((bytesRead = is.read(buffer)) != -1) {\nfos.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The issue with your current code is that you are reading each byte individually from the InputStream, which is causing the slow performance. Instead, you should read a larger chunk of data at once using the read() method. The reason the if statement is not executed is because you are not checking the value of the read bytes. Instead of reading and printing each byte, you should write the bytes to the file and check the value of the read bytes to see if the checkbox values are being read correctly."}
