I have never really worked with networking too much, so the issue is figuring out how to send packets correctly. I am currently at the position of creating the handshake with the server. After hours of research, I have come up with the following code, but it always runs into the \"Failed! (Exception)\" message. To me, everything looks correct, but for all I know it could be 100% wrong. If someone could point out what I'm doing wrong here, I'd really appreciate it.For reference, feel free to use this and this.public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {    host = new InetSocketAddress(\"162.244.165.111\", 48040);    socket = new Socket();    System.out.println(\"Connecting...\");    socket.connect(host, 3000);    System.out.println(\"Done!\");    System.out.println(\"Making streams...\");    output = new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());    input = new DataInputStream(socket.getInputStream());    System.out.println(\"Done!\");    System.out.println(\"Attempting handshake... \"+host.getAddress().toString().substring(1));    byte[] msg = (\"47;\"+host.getAddress().toString().substring(1)+\";\"+host.getPort()+\";2;\").getBytes(Charset.forName(\"UTF-16\"));    output.writeInt(msg.length+Integer.valueOf(0x00));    output.writeByte(0x00);    output.write(msg);    output.flush();    try {        if (input.readByte() != 0x02)            System.out.println(\"Failed!\");        else            System.out.println(\"Done!\");    } catch (EOFException e) {        System.out.println(\"Failed! (Exception)\");    }}EDIT:More research suggests I use a Byte array, but this confuses me on how to represent a string and using strings is required?\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: DataOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>: private void buildHandshakePacket(DataOutputStream dataOutputStream, String serverAddress, int serverPort) throws IOException {\ndataOutputStream.writeBytes(twoHyphens + boundary + lineEnd);\ndataOutputStream.writeBytes(\"Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"packet\\\"\");\ndataOutputStream.writeBytes(lineEnd);\ndataOutputStream.writeInt(47);\ndataOutputStream.writeBytes(serverAddress.getBytes(Charset.forName(\"UTF-16\")));\ndataOutputStream.writeBytes(lineEnd);\ndataOutputStream.writeInt(serverPort);\ndataOutputStream.writeBytes(lineEnd);\ndataOutputStream.writeInt(2);\ndataOutputStream.writeByte(0x00);\ndataOutputStream.write(msg.getBytes(Charset.forName(\"UTF-16\")));\ndataOutputStream.writeBytes(lineEnd);\ndataOutputStream.flush();\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The issue with your code is that you are using a String object to represent the server address and port number, which is not the correct way to do it. Instead, you should use a byte array to represent the data, as DataOutputStream.write() expects a byte array as input.\n\nTo create a byte array from a String, you can use the Charset.forName(\"UTF-16\") method to convert the string to a byte array, like this:\n\nmsg = serverAddress.getBytes(Charset.forName(\"UTF-16\"));\n\nThen, you can pass the byte array to the DataOutputStream.write() method, like this:\n\ndataOutputStream.write(msg);\n\nBy doing this, you should be able to send the handshake packet correctly."}
