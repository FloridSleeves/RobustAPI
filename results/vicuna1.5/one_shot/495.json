Try to just use the value of the foreach inside the loop.\nQuestion: Concurrent calls to API to return different object: :I have the following scenario Query results:student1  subject1  marks1student2  subject1  marks3......The API code looks like thisStudentObj getStudentInfo() {    List<StudentObj> stObj = StudentDAO.getRows(); //    for (StudentObj s : stObj) {       //What should I write here??    }}I want to be able to return student1 rows, student2 rows separately in concurrent calls to my API. I am using Hibernate (to which I am relatively new) on top of oracle database.I was thinking in lines of locking student1 row and returning that row, but I am not very conversant with locking in hibernate.On Client Side time t1: getStudentInfo() (work on student1) |  getStudentInfo() //Call concurrently (work on student2)time t1+10sec: getStudentInfo (work on student3)time t1+20sec: getStudentInfo (work on student4)First call should be able to work on student1 and second concurrent call should be able to work on student2.Edit: Made changes based on comments. ( I cannot edit the query and clients getStudentInfo cannot pass the id if that helps).\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: You can use the Iterator.next() method to retrieve the next value from the iterator. However, since you are using Hibernate, you can also use the 'nextResult()' method to retrieve the next result from the query.\n\nHere's an example:\n```vbnet\nList<StudentObj> stObj = StudentDAO.getRows();\nIterator<StudentObj> it = stObj.iterator();\nwhile (it.hasNext()) {\n    StudentObj s = it.next();\n    //Do something with s\n}\n\n//Alternatively\nList<StudentObj> stObj = StudentDAO.getRows();\nStudentObj s = stObj.get(0);\n//Do something with s\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: By using the Iterator.next() method, you will retrieve the first value from the iterator in each iteration of the loop. Instead, you can use the 'nextResult()' method to retrieve the next result from the query, allowing you to work on different rows in concurrent calls to your API."}
