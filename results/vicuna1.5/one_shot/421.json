Try to just use the value of the foreach inside the loop.\nQuestion: round robin scheduling java iterators: :I have a list of hosts in an array which represnt the servers available to do a particular job. Currently I simply iterate thru the list looking and establish comms with a host to check its not busy. If not I will send a job to it. This approach tends to mean that the first host in the list tends to get hot constanly with the load not balanced properly with the rest of the available hosts.in pseudocode ..for (Host h : hosts) {    //checkstatus    if status == job accepted break;}I'd like to balance this load properly between the hosts i.e first time host one is used 2nd time the method is used host 2. Just wondering that the most elegant solution to this is ??ThanksW\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: You can use a Round Robin scheduling algorithm to balance the load between the hosts. The basic idea is to keep track of the current host being used and rotate to the next host when the current one is finished. Here's an example implementation in Java:\n```scss\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.Iterator;\nimport java.util.List;\n\npublic class LoadBalancer {\n    private List<Host> hosts;\n    private int currentHost = 0;\n\n    public LoadBalancer(List<Host> hosts) {\n        this.hosts = hosts;\n    }\n\n    public void balanceLoad() {\n        Iterator<Host> it = hosts.iterator();\n        while (it.hasNext()) {\n            Host host = it.next();\n            if (host.isAvailable()) {\n                currentHost = (currentHost + 1) % hosts.size();\n                host.acquireJob();\n                it.remove();\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    private static class Host {\n        private boolean isAvailable = true;\n        private boolean hasJob = false;\n\n        public boolean acquireJob() {\n            if (hasJob) {\n                isAvailable = false;\n                return false;\n            }\n            hasJob = true;\n            return true;\n        }\n\n        public boolean releaseJob() {\n            hasJob = false;\n            isAvailable = true;\n            return true;\n        }\n\n        public boolean isAvailable() {\n            return isAvailable;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this implementation, `Host` is a simple class that represents a host and has methods to acquire and release a job. The `LoadBalancer` class keeps track of the current host being used and rotates to the next one when the current one is finished. The `balanceLoad()` method is called to start the load balancing process.\n\nNote that this is just one possible implementation of a Round Robin scheduling algorithm. There are many variations and optimizations that can be made depending on the specific requirements of your application."}
