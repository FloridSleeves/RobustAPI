USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Android InputStream.read() horribly slow:I'm working on an Android app that needs to communicate with a server (running on my PC) which is also written by me. The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: How to parse multiple, consecutive xml files in one document?: :I have a big text file that is a sequence of XML-valid documents that looks something like this:<DOC>   <TEXT> ... </TEXT>    ...</DOC><DOC>    <TEXT> ... </TEXT>    ...</DOC>etc. There is no <?xml version=\"1.0\">, the <DOC></DOC> delimits each separate xml. What's the best way to parse this in Java and get the values under <TEXT> in each <DOC>?If I pass the whole thing to a DocumentBuilder, I get an error saying the document is not well formed. Is there a better solution than simply traversing through, a building a string for each <DOC>?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(is));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {\n// process each line and extract the values under <TEXT>\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: Instead of reading each byte individually, you can use a BufferedReader to read each line of the input stream. This way, you can process the entire text file more efficiently and extract the values under <TEXT> in each <DOC>."}
