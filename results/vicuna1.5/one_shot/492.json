Try to just use the value of the foreach inside the loop.\nQuestion: thread safe LinkedHashMap without Collections.synchronized: :I am using a LinkedHashMap and the environment is multi threaded so this structure needs to be thread safe. During specific events I need to read the entire map push to db and clear all. Most of time only writes happen to this map. This map has a limit 50 entries.I am using Oracle MAF and it does not have Collections.syncronizedMap available. So, what are things I need to put in synchronized blocks to make sure writing and reading doesn't hit me concurrentModificationException etcFew requirements:I need to behave it like a circular queue so Overriding removeEldestEntry method of the LinkedHashMap. I need to preserve the order\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Synchronization\n<<<code>>>:\n```\nsynchronized (this) {\n    for (Iterator<Map.Entry<String, String>> it = map.entrySet().iterator(); it.hasNext(); ){\n        Map.Entry<String, String> entry = it.next();\n        String key = entry.getKey();\n        String value = entry.getValue();\n        // Perform your operations here\n        it.remove();\n    }\n}\n```\nExplanation:\nYou can use the `synchronized` keyword to ensure that only one thread can access the map at a time. By wrapping the code that modifies the map in a `synchronized` block, you can prevent concurrent modification exceptions and other thread-related issues.\n\nFor preserving the order, you can override the `removeEldestEntry` method of the `LinkedHashMap` class. This method is used to remove the first entry from the map when the capacity is exceeded. You can override it to remove the entry with the smallest key instead of the first one.\n\nHere's an example of how you can override the `removeEldestEntry` method:\n```\n@Override\npublic boolean removeEldestEntry(Map.Entry<String, String> eldest) {\n    return removeEntry(eldest);\n}\n```\nThis will ensure that the entries are removed in the order they were added.\n\nNote: The `synchronized` keyword can be used on any object, not just the `LinkedHashMap` instance. Make sure to use a unique object for synchronization to avoid issues with multiple threads accessing the same object."}
