Improve this question                    I have a database with two tables , First one contains 2 columns: group_ID , group_name . And the second one : ID, Word, Definition , word_group_id . This is the prototype of the function which I am going to write WordContainer [] findWordsByGroupId(int id);and this is the WordContainer class:public class WordContainer {      String word;      String definition;      int id  = -1;public WordContainer (int id , String word ,String definition){    this.id = id;    this.word = word;    this.definition = definition;}public void setWord (String word){    this.word = word;}public void setDefinition (String definition){    this.definition = definition;}public String getWord (){    return this.word;}public String getDefinition (){    return this.definition;}}So the question is , How to write a SQLite query which will find all the rows (or ids of those rows)which have the given group_id ; \nPlease using this api: SQLiteDatabase.query.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: SQLiteDatabase.query\n<<<code>>>: db.query(\"FirstTable\", null,\n         \"group_ID = ?\",\n         new String[] { String.valueOf(id) },\n         null, null, null);\n         db.query(\"SecondTable\", null,\n         \"word_group_id = ?\",\n         new String[] { String.valueOf(id) },\n         null, null, null);\n         db.close();\n\nExplanation:\nTo write a SQLite query that finds all the rows (or IDs of those rows) which have the given group\\_id, you can use a join query between the two tables.\n\nIn the first query, you should select the group\\_ID column from the \"FirstTable\" table and the ID column from the \"SecondTable\" table, and join them on the group\\_ID column. Then, you should filter the results by the given group\\_id.\n\nIn the second query, you should select the ID column from the \"SecondTable\" table and filter the results by the given group\\_id.\n\nNote that you should use the \"?\" placeholder in the selection string to bind the parameter to the given group\\_id value. Also, you should use the \"String.valueOf()\" method to convert the integer value to a string before passing it to the selection string."}
