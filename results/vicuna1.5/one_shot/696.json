{"api": "PrintWriter.write", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem. That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Inject Context (CDI/servlet) into new FutureTask Thread: :I found that a new thread created in the servlet donot contain the servlet/CDI context. I created a HelloWorld servlet (given below) to experiment with this problem. In the below example, you'll see that I am running 'doIt()' function in a new Thread (FutureTask). But it returns NULL but when I call 'doIt()' method directly, BeanManager is not NULL./** * Servlet implementation class HelloWorld */@WebServlet(\"/HelloWorld\")public class HelloWorld extends HttpServlet {    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;    private static Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(HelloWorld.class            .getName());    /**     * @see HttpServlet#doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)     */    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {        PrintWriter writer = response.getWriter();        writer.println(\"<html>\");        writer.println(\"<head><title>Hello World Servlet</title></head>\");        writer.println(\"<body>\");        writer.println(\"<h1>Context injection into Thread Experiment</h1>\");        try {            // 1. This is NOT working            new Thread(testTask).start();            testTask.get(5000, TimeUnit.SECONDS);            // 2. This is working                //doIt();        } catch (Exception e) {            e.printStackTrace();        }        writer.println(\"<body>\");        writer.println(\"</html>\");        writer.close();             }    Runnable runnable = new Runnable() {        @Override        public void run() {            try {                doIt();            } catch (Exception e) {                e.printStackTrace();            }        }    };    FutureTask<Object> testTask = new FutureTask<Object>(runnable, null);    protected void doIt() throws Exception {        if(getBeanManager() == null) {             throw new Exception( \"BEAN MANAGER IS NULL\");         }    }    public static BeanManager getBeanManager() {        try {            InitialContext initialContext = new InitialContext();            return (BeanManager) initialContext.lookup(\"java:comp/BeanManager\");        } catch (NamingException e) {            logger.info(\"Couldn't get BeanManager through JNDI\");            return null;        }    }}I searched online but could not find a good reference than saying it is possible. It would be great, if anybody can help me or provide me with some good pointers to inject/pass context into the new thread.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break.
