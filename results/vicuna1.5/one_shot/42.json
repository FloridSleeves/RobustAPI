If the file were an image I would do something like this normally to show all applications capable of viewing the image.Intent intent = new Intent();intent.setAction(android.content.Intent.ACTION_VIEW);intent.setDataAndType(Uri.fromFile(file), \"image/*\");context.startActivity(intent);However say I have an unknown file how could I list all applications able to view a file so the user can select the appropriate application to open the file in my application.I also need the titles listed in an arraylist if possible so I can list them in a listview. Thank you for any help with getting a list of applications capable of viewing a file===================================EditAlright well something easier how can i get the applications from the above intent into an arraylist i could just do image/* audio/* etc and add them all to a list and then list them in a listview and that would solve my problem\nPlease using this api: ApplicationInfo.loadIcon.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: ApplicationInfo.loadIcon\n<<<code>>>: PackageManager packageManager = getPackageManager();\nString appName = applicationInfo.loadLabel(packageManager);\ntry{ Drawable appIcon = applicationInfo.loadIcon(packageManager);}\ncatch{System.out.println(\"Error\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: First get the instance of package manager, then get App name and App icon via ApplicationInfo instance.\n\nTo get the list of applications that can view an unknown file, you can use the following code:\n\n<<<code>>>: List<Application> apps = new ArrayList<>();\nIntent intent = new Intent();\nintent.setAction(Intent.ACTION_VIEW);\nintent.setDataAndType(Uri.fromFile(file), \"*/*\");\nPackageManager packageManager = getPackageManager();\nList<ResolveInfo> infos = packageManager.queryIntentActivities(intent, 0);\nfor (ResolveInfo info : infos) {\nString packageName = info.activityInfo.packageName;\nif (packageName.startsWith(\"com.google\")) {\ncontinue;\n}\nif ((info.activityInfo.flags & ActivityInfo.FLAG_SYSTEM) == 0) {\napps.add(new Application(packageName, info.loadLabel(packageManager), info.loadIcon(packageManager)));\n}\n}\n\nHere, we are creating an Intent to view the unknown file and setting the data and type to \"*/*\" to match all types of files. Then we are querying the PackageManager to get a list of ResolveInfos for the Intent. For each ResolveInfo, we are getting the package name, app name, and app icon and adding them to the list of applications.\n\nNote that this will only give you a list of non-system applications that can view the file. If you want to include system applications as well, you can remove the check for FLAG\\_SYSTEM from the code."}
