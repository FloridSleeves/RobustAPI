Try to just use the value of the foreach inside the loop.\nQuestion: Java, Linked List of Item objects. How to refer to the current item?: :I have a class which holds a linked list of Item objects. I want this class to hold the \"current\" Item somehow so I can refer to it in other parts of the program. Is the best way to do this to create a Item object within my class and set it equal to the \"current\" Item when I wish to set it?as such:for(int i = 0; i < [LinkedListofItems].length(); i++)    {Item currentItem = [LinkedListofItems].getAt(i); break;}And then if I would like to set and Items attributes equal to anothers I would override the = operator?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: You can use the Iterator.next() method to get the current Item in your Linked List of Item objects.\n<<<explanation>>>: Yes, creating an Item object within your class and setting it equal to the \"current\" Item when you wish to refer to it is a good approach. You can then use the .getAt(i) method to get the current Item at a specific index in your Linked List. If you want to set the attributes of one Item to another, you can override the equals() and hashCode() methods in your Item class to ensure that two Items are equal based on their attributes."}
