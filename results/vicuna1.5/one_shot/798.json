USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem. That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: write the console output to a text file using jsoup: :I wanted to write the console output to a text file but somehow it only writes one line to my text file. I am new  to Java. I don't understand the p in the code, so please help me. Here is my code :package htmlparser;import java.io.IOException;import java.util.logging.*;    import org.jsoup.*;import org.jsoup.nodes.*;import org.jsoup.select.*;    import java.io.FileWriter;import java.io.PrintWriter;import java.io.File;import java.io.*;public class Htmlparser {  public static void main(String[] args)  {    try {      String url = \"http://cell-phone-providers-review.toptenreviews.com/cingular-review.html\";      Document doc = Jsoup.connect(url).get();      Elements paragraphs = doc.select(\"p\");      for(Element p : paragraphs)        System.out.println(p.text());      PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(\"C:/Users/Desktop/outputtext.txt\"));       out.print(System.in);       out.close();              }     catch (IOException ex) {      Logger.getLogger(Htmlparser.class.getName())            .log(Level.SEVERE, null, ex);    }  }}\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(\"C:/Users/Desktop/outputtext.txt\")); out.print(System.in); out.close(); } catch (IOException ex) { Logger.getLogger(Htmlparser.class.getName()).log(Level.SEVERE, null, ex); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are trying to write the console output to a file using PrintWriter, but the content of System.in is not being flushed to the console. To fix this, you can use the flush() method of the PrintWriter to flush the content to the console, or use the println() method instead of print() to automatically flush the content."}
