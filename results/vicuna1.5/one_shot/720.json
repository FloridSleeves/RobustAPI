{"api": "PrintWriter.write", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem. That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Java Replace words within xml: :I have the following xml<some tag>    <some_nested_tag attr=\"Hello\"> Text </some_nested_tag>    Hello world Hello Programming</some tag>From the above xml, I want to replace the occurances of the word \"Hello\" which are part of the tag content but not part of tag attribute.I want the following output (Replacing Hello by HI):<some tag>    <some_nested_tag attr=\"Hello\"> Text </some_nested_tag>    HI world HI Programming</some tag>I tried java regex and also some of the DOM parser tutorials, but without any luck. I am posting here for help as I have limited time available to fix this in my project. Help would be appreciated.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"<some tag>\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\nprintWriter.write(\"<some_nested_tag attr=\\\"Hello\\\">\");\nprintWriter.write(\"Text\");\nprintWriter.write(\"</some_nested_tag>\");\nprintWriter.write(\"<some_nested_tag attr=\\\"HI\\\">\");\nprintWriter.write(\"Text\");\nprintWriter.write(\"</some_nested_tag>\");\nprintWriter.write(\"</some tag>\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though. To fix this, you can use the PrintWriter class to write the xml data to the file. You can write the opening and closing tags of the xml, then write the content of the tags and finally write the closing tags. This way you can ensure that the xml data is properly formatted and can be read by other xml parsers."}
