WIFI Direct allows devices to connect to each other directly without the need for a wireless access point. To implement this feature, you can use the WIFI Direct API to create a direct connection between the two devices. Once the connection is established, you can use the DataOutputStream.write method to send data from app \"A\" to app \"B\". You can also use NFC (Near Field Communication) to send data between the two devices if WIFI Direct is not available or not preferred."}
