USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to increment a Map value in Java: Say I'm creating a word frequency list, using a Map (probably a HashMap), where each key is a String with the word that's being counted and the value is an Integer that's incremented each time a token of the word is found. Can you help me with this?\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Map.get\n<<<code>>>: import java.util.HashMap;import java.util.Map;Map<String, Integer> freq = new HashMap<String, Integer>();Integer count = freq.get(word);if (count == null) {freq.put(word, 1);}else {freq.put(word, count + 1);}\n<<<explanation>>>: If you look at the API for Map, get operations usually return null when the map does not contain the requested element. Note that this will make a solution.\nQuestion: How do you declare an array where user can specify dimension?: :I want a function / data structure that can do this:func(int dim){if(dim == 1)int[] array;else if (dim == 2)int[][] array;else if (dim == 3)int[][][] array;.....}anyone know how?\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Map.get\n<<<code>>>: import java.util.HashMap;import java.util.Map;Map<String, Integer> freq = new HashMap<String, Integer>();Integer count = freq.get(dim);if (count == null) {freq.put(dim, 1);}else {freq.put(dim, count + 1);}\n<<<explanation>>>: You can use a Map to store the dimension as the key and the array as the value. Then, you can use the get method to retrieve the array based on the dimension value. If the dimension is not found in the map, you can use the put method to add a new entry with the dimension value and a default array size of 1."}
