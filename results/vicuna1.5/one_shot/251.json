USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Android InputStream.read() horribly slow:I'm working on an Android app that needs to communicate with a server (running on my PC) which is also written by me. The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: How to move data from java InputStream to a char * in c++ with jni?: :How can I move the data stored in a java InputStream to a char * in c++ using JNI?Thanks,Carlos.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>:\nJNIEXPORT jint JNICALL Java_com_example_myapp_MainActivity_readStreamToC(JNIEnv *env, jobject thiz) {\njint bytesRead = 0;\njbyte *buffer = new jbyte[1024];\nwhile ((bytesRead = in->read(buffer, 1024)) > 0) {\n// copy the data from buffer to char \\* in c++\n}\nreturn bytesRead;\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: You can use the JNI API to read data from a Java InputStream and move it to a char \\* in C++. In the JNI method, you can use the InputStream.read() method to read data from the InputStream and store it in a buffer. Then, you can copy the data from the buffer to a char \\* in C++ using the JNIEnv->GetByteArrayPointer() method. Note that you should also release the buffer using JNIEnv->DeleteLocalRef() to avoid memory leaks."}
