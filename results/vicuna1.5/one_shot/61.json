The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: I am trying to read lines of text from the console. The number of lines is not known in advance. The BufferedReader.readLine() method reads a line but after the last line it waits for input from the console. What should be done in order to avoid this?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: public static String[] getLinesFromConsole() {\n    String strLine = \"\";\n    try {\n    // Get the object of DataInputStream\n    InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);\n    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);\n    String line = \"\";\n    while ((line = br.readLine()) != null && !line.equals(\"exit\") )\n        strLine += br.readLine() + \"~\";\n        isr.close();                                                        \n    } catch (IOException ioe) {\n        ioe.printStackTrace();                                \n    }\n    return strLine.split(\"~\");\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The below code might fix, replace text exit with your requirement specific string.\nQuestion: How to get rid of Checkstyle message 'File does not end with a newline.': :I'm working with a Maven (jar) Project in Netbeans (Windows), which creates Checkstyle reports with the Maven Checkstyle plugin.No matter what I do, I always get the message: File does not end with a newline for Java class files.What can I do/configure in either Netbeans or Checkstyle to get rid of the message ?Versions of used software:WinXP SP3Netbeans 6.7 RC1 (happens with 6.5 too)Maven 2.0.9Maven Checkstyle Plugin 2.2Java 1.6 (Update 14)\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: public static void setEndOfFile(File file) throws IOException {\nfile.createNewFile();\nfile.setLastModified(new Date().getTime());\nfile.setReadOnly();\n}\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: This code sets the end of file marker in the file, which will prevent the file from being read beyond the end of the file. This will fix the Checkstyle message \"File does not end with a newline\" for Java class files."}
