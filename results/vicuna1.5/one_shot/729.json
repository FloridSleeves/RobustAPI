USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem. That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: java performance on two different servers: :not sure if this question should be here or in serverfault, but it's java-related so here it is:I have two servers, with very similar technology:server1 is Oracle/Sun x86 with dual x5670 CPU (2.93 GHz) (4 cores each), 12GB RAM. server2 is Dell R610 with dual x5680 CPU (3.3 GHz) (6 cores each), 16GB RAM.both are running Solaris x86, with exact same configuration.both have turbo-boost enabled, and no hyper-threading.server2 should therefore be SLIGHTLY faster than server1.I'm running the following short test program on the two platforms.import java.io.*;public class TestProgram {public static void main(String[] args) {    new TestProgram ();}public TestProgram () {    try {        PrintWriter writer  = new PrintWriter(new FileOutputStream(\"perfs.txt\", true), true);        for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {            long t1 = System.nanoTime();            System.out.println(\"0123456789qwertyuiop0123456789qwertyuiop0123456789qwertyuiop0123456789qwertyuiop\");            long t2 = System.nanoTime();            writer.println((t2-t1));            //try {            //  Thread.sleep(1);            //}            //catch(Exception e) {            //  System.out.println(\"thread sleep exception\");            //}        }    }    catch(Exception e) {        e.printStackTrace(System.out);    }}}I'm opening perfs.txt and averaging the results, I get:server1: average = 1664 , trim 10% = 1615server2: average = 1510 , trim 10% = 1429which is a somewhat expected result (server2 perfs > server1 perfs).now, I uncomment the \"Thread.sleep(1)\" part and test again, the results are now:server1: average = 27598 , trim 10% = 26583server2: average = 52320 , trim 10% = 39359this time server2 perfs < server1 perfsthat doesn't make any sense to me...obviously I'm looking at a way to improve server2 perfs in the second case. there must be some kind of configuration that is different, and I don't know which one.OS are identical, java version are identical.could it be linked to the number of cores ?maybe it's a BIOS setting ? although BIOS are different (AMI vs Dell), settings seem pretty similar.I'll update the Dell's BIOS soon and retest, but I would appreciate any insight...thanks\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break.

However, it is possible that the difference in performance is due to the number of cores and the clock speed of the CPUs. It is also possible that there are differences in the way the operating systems are configured or the way the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is running on each server. It is recommended to check the BIOS settings and make sure that they are the same on both servers. Additionally, it may be helpful to check the JVM settings and make sure that they are optimized for performance."}
