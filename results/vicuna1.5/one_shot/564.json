Try to just use the value of the foreach inside the loop.\nQuestion: Is returning an iterator of private List (in class) considered bad practice?: :Suppose I have two classes: Animal and Zoo, which has private List containing instances of Animal. Reason why I want to return iterator is to avoid defining setters and getters and removal methods. Does that break encapsulation?class Zoo{    private List<Animal> animalList;    public Zoo(){        animalList = new ArrayList<Animal>();    }    public void addAnimal(Animal animal){        animalList.add(animal);    }    public Iterator<Animal> iterator(){        return animalList.iterator();    }}class Animal{    private String name;    private double weight, height;    Animal(String name, double weight, double height){        this.name = name;        this.weight = weight;        this.height = height;    }}\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: For the Zoo class, you can return an Iterator of the List of Animal objects in the Zoo class. However, returning an Iterator of a private List is not considered bad practice. It does not break encapsulation since the Iterator is not modifying the List directly, it only allows other classes to access the elements of the List.\n\nFor the Animal class, since it is a inner class of Zoo, you can access the private List of Animal objects in the Zoo class using the this keyword.\n\n<<<explanation>>>: Returning an Iterator of a private List in the Zoo class is not considered bad practice.
