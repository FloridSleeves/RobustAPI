{"api": "SQLiteDatabase.query", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to query using SQLiteDatabase.query: How can I make query using SQLiteDatabase.query ?\n\n\"Select * from table where col1 = something AND col2 IS NOT NULL\"\nI tried it by putting the col2 with a =? in selection String and NOT NULL in selection argument but it doesn't work.\n\nPlease tell me where m going wrong.\n\nPlease using this api: SQLiteDatabase.query.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: SQLiteDatabase.query\n<<<code>>>: db.query(\"MyTable\", null,\n         \"col1 = ? AND col2 IS NOT NULL\",\n         new String[] { \"something\" },\n         null, null, null);\n         db.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: selectionArgs is an array of strings, and can be used only for string values.\n\nWhen you use col2 = ? with the string NOT NULL, you are telling the database to check if the column's value is the eight-character string \"NOT NULL\".\n\nYou must write col2 IS NOT NULL directly into the selection string:\nQuestion: How to know which data is from which table when you select data from multiple tables?: :I have a table of client contain the client id, name and last name, job ..etc...also I have 16 tables of the grants of client each table contain a different data(different grant) relate with the client by a foreign key of \"id\".......for example this is costumer table\"clients\":enter image description hereand this is an example for an grant of client called order:enter image description hereSo when I search for client, I search also for all the grants that he benefited them, and maybe a client can benefit from the same grant more than once........that's means we can find more than one row in the same table relate with the same client: As you see in the table Of order we have two row relate with the client who have id=2.: So I want to make one query to select all data from the first table and the second of the client \"Where id =2\"the problem is how I can get all the information relate with that client and to which row from which table ??\nPlease using this api: SQLiteDatabase.query.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: SQLiteDatabase.query\n<<<code>>>: db.query(\"clients\", null,\n\"id = ?\",\nnew String[] { \"2\" },\nnull, null, null);\ndb.query(\"orders\", null,\n\"client_id = ?\",\nnew String[] { \"2\" },\nnull, null, null);\ndb.close();\n\nExplanation:\nTo select all data from multiple tables related to a specific client, you can use the SQLiteDatabase.query method with a join clause. In this case, you want to join the \"clients\" table and the \"orders\" table based on the foreign key relationship between them.\n\nThe first query selects all columns from the \"clients\" table where the \"id\" is equal to 2. The second query selects all columns from the \"orders\" table where the \"client\\_id\" is equal to 2. By using the \"?\" placeholder in the selection string, you can pass the client ID as a parameter to the query.\n\nWhen you execute the query, it will return all rows from both tables where the client ID is 2, and you will be able to see the data from both tables related to that client."}
