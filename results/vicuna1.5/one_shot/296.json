Try to just use the value of the foreach inside the loop.\nQuestion: Java sorting an array of words with threads: :I have a txt-file of names I need to be able to sort alphabetically. My program then takes the array, splits into the amount of threads passed as an argument in the terminal, and gives each thread a piece of the array to sort, then stores all the threads in an array. Now, what I need some help with is this:I now want to take threads, as soon as they are done (Ie. if two are done before the others, they start to merge then wait for more). Think of it like braiding. I know how to write the sorting code for the merging, but what I hope you can help me with is this: How do I manage the threads? I know what wait() and notify() does, but I can't seem to be able to wrap my ead around what exactly I would need to do to make them merge into one array. Should I:Create a method inside the thread-class that merges the arrays?Create a new thread for every other thread that is done, pass the two sorted word-arrays as a parameter, and let that thread do the sorting?Something else I haven't thought of. I hope this was clear enough, and of good enough quality as the questions should be.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Thread\n<<<code>>>: You can use a synchronized block to protect the array from concurrent modification. Inside the block, you can check if the array has been modified and if not, you can add the sorted word-array to the array.\n\nHere's an example:\n```\nsynchronized (array) {\n    while (array.length > 0) {\n        if (array[0].length == 0) {\n            array.remove(0);\n        } else {\n            array[0].sort();\n        }\n    }\n    sortedArray.add(array[0]);\n}\n```\nYou can also use a `CopyOnWriteArrayList` instead of a regular `ArrayList` to avoid the need for synchronization.\n\n<<<explanation>>>: By using synchronized block, you can ensure that only one thread can access the array at a time, thus preventing concurrent modification and ensuring that the array is sorted correctly. The while loop checks if the array has any elements, if not then it means the array has been modified and we can add the sorted word-array to the sortedArray."}
