USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem. That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Calculating scores using user input: :I need to be able to complete this program.  I am completely lost after missing a class.  I need to be able to out put to a txt file the Total, Percentage, Highest, Lowest and Grade.  I have it where I can input the 5 scores given to me but the rest is not working.  I am completely lost, no idea where I need to go from what I have.  I can use a loop but its not necessary.import java.util.Scanner;public class BenefieldProgram4 { public static void main(String[ ] args)  {         Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);         System.out.println(\"Enter 5 Grades:\");         System.out.println(\"\");         keyboard.nextDouble();         double a, b, c, d, e; //5 Grades         double sum = 0;     // total         double avg;        // percentage         double min = 1;    // lowest grade         double max = 100;  // highest grade         //Calculations         a = keyboard.nextDouble();         b = keyboard.nextDouble();         c = keyboard.nextDouble();         d = keyboard.nextDouble();         e = keyboard.nextDouble();         keyboard.close();         sum = (a+b+c+d+e);         System.out.println(\"Total Score=:\"+sum);         avg =(a+b+c+d+e)/500;         System.out.println(\"Percentage =: \"+avg);          max = Double.MAX_VALUE;           System.out.println(\"Highest Score= \" +max);         min = Double.MIN_VALUE;         System.out.println(\"Lowest Score= \" +min);         if (avg >= 90)            System.out.println(\"Grade= A\");            else if (avg >=80)            System.out.println(\"Grade= B\");            else if (avg >= 70)            System.out.println(\"Grade= C\");            else if (avg >= 60)            System.out.println(\"Grade= D\");            else            System.out.println(\"Grade= F\");             } }}Edit\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break.
