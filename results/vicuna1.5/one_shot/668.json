{"api": "PrintWriter.write", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem. That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: PrintWriter#println method not working as expected: :This code:PrintWriter output = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(outputFile, false));output.println(\"something\\n\");output.println(\"something else\\n\");Outputs:somethingsomething elseInstead of:somethingsomething elseI tried using \"\\r\\n\" instead of just \"\\n\" but it just doesn't work like how I want it to. How do I fix this?P.S. I'm using windows 7\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"something\\r\\n\"); printWriter.write(\"something else\\r\\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The issue is that the \"\\r\\n\" escape sequence is not being interpreted as a line break by the PrintWriter. To fix this, you can use the \"\\r\\n\" escape sequence in the write method. This will write the line break sequence to the output file, which will be interpreted as a line break when reading with BufferedReader."}
