{"api": "PrintWriter.write", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem. That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: what is the efficent way to process larges text files?: :I have two files:1- with 1400000 line or record --- 14 MB2- with 16000000 -- 170 MBI want to find if each record or line in file 1 is also in file 2 or notI develop a java app that do the following: Read file line by line and pass each line to a method that loop in file 2 Here is my code:  public boolean hasIDin(String bioid) throws Exception {    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"C://AllIDs.txt\"));    long bid = Long.parseLong(bioid);    String thisLine;    while((thisLine = br.readLine( )) != null)    {         if (Long.parseLong(thisLine) == bid)            return true;    }        return false;    }public void getMBD() throws Exception{     BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"C://DIDs.txt\"));     OutputStream os = new FileOutputStream(\"C://MBD.txt\");     PrintWriter pr = new PrintWriter(os);     String thisLine;     int count=1;     while ((thisLine = br.readLine( )) != null){         String bioid = thisLine;         System.out.println(count);         if(! hasIDin(bioid))                pr.println(bioid);     count++;     }    pr.close();}  When I run it seems it will take more 1944.44444444444 hours to complete as every line processing takes 5 sec. That is about three months!Is there any ideas to make it done in a much much more less time.Thanks in advance.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: You can use the write(String) method of PrintWriter to write the contents of a BufferedReader line by line.\n<<<explanation>>>: Instead of reading the entire file into a string and then writing it to the output file, you can read the file line by line and write each line to the output file using the write(String) method of PrintWriter. This will reduce the amount of memory used and improve the performance of your code."}
