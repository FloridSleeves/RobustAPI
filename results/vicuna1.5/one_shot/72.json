Why is that? What do I need to change to send the text along with file like it would be without?\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: DataOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>: private void buildTextPart(DataOutputStream dataOutputStream, String parameterName, String parameterValue) throws IOException {\n    dataOutputStream.writeBytes(twoHyphens + boundary + lineEnd);\n        dataOutputStream.writeBytes(\"Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"\");\n            dataOutputStream.write(parameterName.getBytes(\"UTF-8\"));\n                dataOutputStream.writeBytes(lineEnd);\n                    dataOutputStream.writeBytes(\"Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\" + lineEnd);\n                        dataOutputStream.writeBytes(lineEnd);\n                            dataOutputStream.write(parameterValue.getBytes(\"UTF-8\"));\n                                dataOutputStream.writeBytes(lineEnd);\n\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: Here is how to solve this:\nQuestion: What Java class allows to write to a file, both in Binary and ASCII?: :I need to write files, with Headers in ASCII and values in Binary.For now, I'm using this:File file = new File(\"~/myfile\");FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(file);// Write in ASCIIout.write((\"This is a header\\n\").getBytes());// Write a byte[] is quite easybyte[] buffer = new buffer[4];out.write(buffer, 0, 4);// Write an int in binary gets complicatedout.write(ByteBuffer.allocate(4).putInt(6).array());//Write a float in binary gets even more complicatedout.write(ByteBuffer.allocate(4).order(ByteOrder.BIG_ENDIAN)        .putFloat(4.5).array());The problem is that it's very slow (in terms of performance) to write that way, way slower than writing the values in ASCII actually. But it should be shorter since in I'm writing less data.I've looked at other Java classes, and it seems to me that they are either only for ASCII writing, or only for Binary writing.Would you have any other proposition for this problem ?\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: DataOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>: private void writeFileHeader(DataOutputStream dataOutputStream, String fileName, String contentType) throws IOException {\ndataOutputStream.writeBytes(twoHyphens + boundary + lineEnd);\ndataOutputStream.writeBytes(\"Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"file\\\"; filename=\\\"\" + fileName + \"\\\"\" + lineEnd);\ndataOutputStream.writeBytes(\"Content-Type: \" + contentType + lineEnd);\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: You can use the DataOutputStream.write method to write both ASCII and binary data. The write method takes a byte array as input and writes it to the DataOutputStream. To write a header in ASCII, you can create a string with the desired header information and use the DataOutputStream.write method to write it to the stream. To write binary data, you can create a ByteBuffer object and use the DataOutputStream.write method to write the buffer to the stream.\n\nFor example, to write a float in binary, you can create a ByteBuffer object with the desired byte order and use the putFloat method to write the float to the buffer. Then, you can use the DataOutputStream.write method to write the buffer to the stream.\n\nHere is an example of how to write a float in binary using DataOutputStream.write:\n```\nByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(4).order(ByteOrder.BIG_ENDIAN).putFloat(4.5f);\ndataOutputStream.write(buffer.array());\n```\nIt's important to note that when writing binary data, you should use the put method of the ByteBuffer class to write the data, instead of the write method of the DataOutputStream class. This is because the write method of the DataOutputStream class is optimized for writing ASCII data, and can cause performance issues when writing binary data."}
