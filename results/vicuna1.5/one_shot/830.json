{"api": "PrintWriter.write", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem. That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: How to empty file content and then append text multiple times: :I have a file (file.txt), and I need to empty his current content, and then to append some text multiple times.Example: file.txt current content is:aaabbbcccI want to remove this content, and then to append the first time:dddThe second time:eeeAnd so on...I tried this:// empty the current contentfileOut = new FileWriter(\"file.txt\");fileOut.write(\"\");fileOut.close();// appendfileOut = new FileWriter(\"file.txt\", true);// when I want to write something I just do this multiple times:fileOut.write(\"text\");fileOut.flush();This works fine, but it seems inefficient because I open the file 2 times just for remove the current content.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though. To fix this, you need to add a line break at the end of your write method call.\n\nRegarding your second question, you can use the following code to empty the file content and then append text multiple times:\n\n<<<api>>>: FileWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try {\nFileWriter fileOut = new FileWriter(\"file.txt\", true);\nfileOut.write(\"\"); // empty the content\nfileOut.write(\"ddd\"); // append the first time\nfileOut.write(\"eee\"); // append the second time\nfileOut.write(\"fff\"); // append the third time\nfileOut.close();\n} catch (IOException e) {\ne.printStackTrace();\n}\n\nThis code opens the file in append mode, so you only need to open it once. Then it writes the empty string to remove the current content, followed by the desired text to be appended. Finally, it closes the file."}
