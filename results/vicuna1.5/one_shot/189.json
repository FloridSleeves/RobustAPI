USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Android InputStream.read() horribly slow:I'm working on an Android app that needs to communicate with a server (running on my PC) which is also written by me. The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Java program to count lines, words, and chars from a text given file: :I am practicing to write a program that gets a text file from user and provides data such as characters, words, and lines in the text.I have searched and looked over the same topic but cannot find a way to make my code run.public class Document{private Scanner sc;// Sets users input to a file namepublic Document(String documentName) throws FileNotFoundException {    File inputFile = new File(documentName);    try {        sc = new Scanner(inputFile);    } catch (IOException exception) {        System.out.println(\"File does not exists\");    }}public int getChar() {    int Char= 0;    while (sc.hasNextLine()) {        String line = sc.nextLine();        Char += line.length() + 1;    }    return Char;}// Gets the number of words in a textpublic int getWords() {    int Words = 0;    while (sc.hasNext()) {        String line = sc.next();        Words += new StringTokenizer(line, \" ,\").countTokens();    }    return Words;}public int getLines() {    int Lines= 0;    while (sc.hasNextLine()) {        Lines++;    }    return Lines;}  }Main method: public class Main {    public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException {        DocStats doc = new DocStats(\"someText.txt\");        // outputs 1451, should be 1450        System.out.println(\"Number of characters: \"            + doc.getChar());         // outputs 0, should be 257        System.out.println(\"Number of words: \" + doc.getWords());        // outputs 0, should be 49        System.out.println(\"Number of lines: \" + doc.getLines());     }}I know exactly why I get 1451 instead of 1451. The reason is because I do not have '\\n' at the end of the last sentence but my method adds  numChars += line.length() + 1;However, I cannot find a solution to why I get 0 for words and lines.*My texts includes elements as: ? , - 'After all, could anyone help me to make this work? **So far, I the problem that concerns me is how I can get a number of characters, if the last sentence does not have '\\n' element. Is there a chance I could fix that with an if statement? -Thank you!\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: You can use the read() method of the InputStream to read the file line by line and count the number of characters, words, and lines. Here's an example code:\n```java\npublic class Document {\n    private InputStream inputStream;\n    private int lineCount = 0;\n    private int wordCount = 0;\n    private int charCount = 0;\n\n    public Document(String documentName) throws FileNotFoundException {\n        inputStream = new FileInputStream(documentName);\n    }\n\n    public int getLineCount() {\n        return lineCount;\n    }\n\n    public int getWordCount() {\n        return wordCount;\n    }\n\n    public int getCharCount() {\n        return charCount;\n    }\n\n    public void readFile() throws IOException {\n        BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(inputStream));\n        String line;\n        while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {\n            lineCount++;\n            charCount += line.length();\n            StringTokenizer tokenizer = new StringTokenizer(line, \" \");\n            while (tokenizer.hasMoreTokens()) {\n                wordCount++;\n            }\n        }\n        inputStream.close();\n    }\n}\n```\nYou can then create an instance of the Document class and call the readFile() method to read the file and get the count of lines, words, and characters.\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The read() method reads the file line by line and returns the next line as a string. You can then use the StringTokenizer class to split each line into words and count the number of words. The line count is simply the number of lines read. The word count is the number of words in each line, and the character count is the sum of the lengths of all the lines read."}
