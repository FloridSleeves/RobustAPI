{"api": "PrintWriter.write", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem. That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: get file modification time: :i want to write a code for monitoring file changes and reacting to changes.so i write a TimerTask to periodically check the modification of filebut i have a problem:when file is open by other programs such as excel or word and i'm closing the filewithout any changes,value  File.lastModified() is changing.i am also trying to get modification date by running dir shell script, it's work fine butit only has minute accuracy!can any one help me?thanks\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: File.lastModified()\n<<<code>>>: File file = new File(\"path/to/file\");\nlong modificationTime = file.lastModified();\n<<<explanation>>>: The File.lastModified() method returns the time the file was last modified in milliseconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC). If the file is being accessed by other programs, the modification time may be changed, which is why you are seeing different values when you close the file without any changes. To get more accurate modification time, you can use the Java File.getLastModified() method which returns the last modified date in a Date object."}
