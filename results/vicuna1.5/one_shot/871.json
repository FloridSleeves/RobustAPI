USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to query using SQLiteDatabase.query: How can I make query using SQLiteDatabase.query ?\n\n\"Select * from table where col1 = something AND col2 IS NOT NULL\"\nI tried it by putting the col2 with a =? in selection String and NOT NULL in selection argument but it doesn't work.\n\nPlease tell me where m going wrong.\n\nPlease using this api: SQLiteDatabase.query.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: SQLiteDatabase.query\n<<<code>>>: db.query(\"MyTable\", null,\n         \"col1 = ? AND col2 IS NOT NULL\",\n         new String[] { \"something\" },\n         null, null, null);\n         db.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: selectionArgs is an array of strings, and can be used only for string values.\n\nWhen you use col2 = ? with the string NOT NULL, you are telling the database to check if the column's value is the eight-character string \"NOT NULL\".\n\nYou must write col2 IS NOT NULL directly into the selection string:\nQuestion: What is the best way to use a single instance of SQLiteOpenHelper among two different activities?: :I'm coding for the first time in Android (Java) an application using a sqlite database. Two activities must save some informations so I use in both a MySQLiteHelper to access the database.I read here that building SQLiteOpenHelper as static data member could be a good practice so I did this. The static factory method ensures that there exists only one DatabaseHelper instance at any time.I create in each activity a SQLiteOpenHelper that uses the method getWritableDatabase() but I don't know where to use the close() method. Should I put this method after every modification or once at the end of the activity ? Thank you =)\nPlease using this api: SQLiteDatabase.query.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: SQLiteDatabase.query\n<<<code>>>: db.query(\"MyTable\", null,\n         \"col1 = ? AND col2 IS NOT NULL\",\n         new String[] { \"something\" },\n         null, null, null);\n         db.close();\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe issue with your query is that you are using the selection string \"col2 = ?\" instead of \"col2 IS NOT NULL\". The selection string should be \"col2 IS NOT NULL\" directly in the query, not in the selection argument.\n\nRegarding your question about using a single instance of SQLiteOpenHelper, it is best practice to create a single instance of SQLiteOpenHelper and use it in both activities. You can create the instance in the application class and use it in both activities by calling the method getWritableDatabase().\n\nAs for the close() method, you should call it once at the end of the activity, after you are finished with the database. This ensures that the connection to the database is properly closed and resources are freed."}
