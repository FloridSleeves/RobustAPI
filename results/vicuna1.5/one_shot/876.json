When the user activates the search box, then I have it set up so that this method should be returning a cursor with the suspected items based on their name. Through debugging, I deduced that the problem was with the method of search inside my Content Provider. Any solutions or thoughts?\nPlease using this api: SQLiteDatabase.query.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: SQLiteDatabase.query\n<<<code>>>: db.query(FORMULA\\_TABLE\\_NAME, null, Formula.FORMULA\\_NAME + \" LIKE ?\", new String[] { query + \"%\" }, null, null, null);\ndb.close();\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe issue with your original query is that you were using the wrong operator for the \"NOT NULL\" condition. Instead of using \"?\", which is used for parameter binding, you should use \"%\" to match any value. Also, you should use the correct operator for the \"NOT NULL\" condition, which is \"IS NOT NULL\".\n\nIn your updated code, you are using the correct operator for the \"NOT NULL\" condition and you are also properly escaping the query string using the \"%\" character. This should fix the issue and allow your query to return the correct results.\n\nRegarding your second question, the error you are encountering is because you are throwing an exception in the catch block of the try-catch statement. When an exception is thrown, the transaction is rolled back and the method returns an error. To fix this, you should either handle the exception or remove the try-catch block altogether.\n\nHere's an updated version of your method that should work:\n\npublic static Cursor getSuggestions(String query) {\nSQLiteDatabase db = dbHelper.getReadableDatabase();\ndb.beginTransaction();\ntry {\nString selection = Formula.FORMULA\\_NAME + \" LIKE ?\";\nString[] selectionArgs = { query + \"%\" };\nCursor cursor = db.query(FORMULA\\_TABLE\\_NAME, null, selection, selectionArgs, null, null, null);\ndb.setTransactionSuccessful();\nreturn cursor;\n} catch (SQLiteException e) {\nthrow new SQLException(\"Failed to retrieve suggestions\", e);\n} finally {\ndb.endTransaction();\n}"}
