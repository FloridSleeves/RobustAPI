{"api": "PrintWriter.write", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem. That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: writing a file in directory using printwriter in java: :file is not creating in my workspace or in any folder, can any one suggect specify a directory and also have to use \"UTF-8\"PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"twitterData_\"+currDate+\".txt\", \"UTF-8\");            writer.println(\"TweetId,UserScreenName,Tweet,TimeStamp\");\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"twitterData_\"+currDate+\".txt\", \"UTF-8\"); writer.println(\"TweetId,UserScreenName,Tweet,TimeStamp\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The issue is that you are not specifying a directory to write the file. Also, you need to close the writer after you are done writing to the file."}
