The issue I am trying to figure out is how to make them all able to be clicked without adding 200 lines of TableRow r1 = (TableRow) findViewById(R.id.table_row_1);TableRow r2 = (TableRow) findViewById(R.id.table_row_2);TableRow r3 = (TableRow) findViewById(R.id.table_row_3);TableRow r4 = (TableRow) findViewById(R.id.table_row_4);r1.setOnClickListener(listener);r2.setOnClickListener(listener);r3.setOnClickListener(listener);r4.setOnClickListener(listener);Eventually the rows will take their id's and search the database for the value (I'm going to use each table row as a key for a value in the database to populate a column in the row) but for now I'm just trying to change the background color of the row when each one is clicked.Questions:How can I handle a large number of clickable rows without thousands of lines of redundant code?  Do I need to set an OnClickListener for each row or is there a better method that I am over looking?  Is there a way to do it in the XML maybe?\nPlease using this api: List.get.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: List.get\n<<<code>>>: E e = list.get(list.size() - 1);\n<<<explanation>>>: First get the size of the list, then the last element is at index size - 1.\n\nTo handle a large number of clickable rows without thousands of lines of redundant code, you can use a more efficient approach than setting an OnClickListener for each row. One solution is to use a RecyclerView and a custom adapter. The RecyclerView will handle the positioning and clicking of the rows, and the custom adapter will allow you to easily update the data and the click listener for each row.\n\nYou can also use the OnTouchListener in the XML to handle the click event on the rows.\n\nAnother solution is to use a library such as FastScroller which allows you to easily handle large number of items in a scrollable list.\n\nDo I need to set an OnClickListener for each row or is there a better method that I am over looking?\n\nYou don't need to set an OnClickListener for each row. Using a RecyclerView and a custom adapter, or using the OnTouchListener in the XML, or using a library such as FastScroller will allow you to handle the click event for all the rows in a more efficient way.\n\nIs there a way to do it in the XML maybe?\n\nYes, you can use the OnTouchListener in the XML to handle the click event on the rows.\n\nYou can also use the RecyclerView and a custom adapter to handle the click event on the rows."}
