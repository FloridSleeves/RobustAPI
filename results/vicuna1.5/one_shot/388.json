Is there any way to preserve it without first extracting it, caching it, and then resetting it?\n\nAnswer: Unfortunately, there is no way to preserve the EXIF data of an image while overwriting it using ImageIO. EXIF data is stored in the file metadata, which is not overwritten when you overwrite the image file. To preserve the EXIF data, you would need to extract it first, cache it, and then reset it after the image transformation is complete."}
