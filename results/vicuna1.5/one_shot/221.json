USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Android InputStream.read() horribly slow:I'm working on an Android app that needs to communicate with a server (running on my PC) which is also written by me. The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: AES encryption, got extra trash characters in decrypted file: :Im making a debug loggin function in an android app.I have a simple class which is logging to .txt file using 128 bit AES encryption.After the logging is done, i decrypt the logged file with a simple JAVA program.The problem is when i decrypt the encrypted log i got some weird content in it, i also got the encrypted content, but there are some extra characters, see below.Android app logging part:public class FileLogger {//file and folder namepublic static String LOG_FILE_NAME = \"my_log.txt\";public static String LOG_FOLDER_NAME = \"my_log_folder\";static SimpleDateFormat formatter = new SimpleDateFormat(\"yyyy-MM-dd_HH-mm-ss_SSS\");//My secret key, 16 bytes = 128 bitstatic byte[] key = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,1,2,3,4,5,6};//Appends to a log file, using encryptionpublic static void appendToLog(Context context, Object msg) {    String msgStr;    String timestamp = \"t:\" + formatter.format(new java.util.Date());    msgStr = msg + \"|\" + timestamp + \"\\n\";    File sdcard = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory();    File dir = new File(sdcard.getAbsolutePath() + \"/\" + LOG_FOLDER_NAME);    if (!dir.exists()) {        dir.mkdir();    }    File encryptedFile = new File(dir, LOG_FILE_NAME);    try {                //Encryption using my key above defined        Key secretKey = new SecretKeySpec(key, \"AES\");        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES\");        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secretKey);        byte[] outputBytes = cipher.doFinal(msgStr.getBytes());        //Writing to the file using append mode        FileOutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream(encryptedFile, true);        outputStream.write(outputBytes);        outputStream.close();                    } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {        e.printStackTrace();    } catch (IOException e) {        e.printStackTrace();    } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {        e.printStackTrace();    } catch (NoSuchPaddingException e) {        e.printStackTrace();    } catch (IllegalBlockSizeException e) {        e.printStackTrace();    } catch (BadPaddingException e) {        e.printStackTrace();    } catch (InvalidKeyException e) {        e.printStackTrace();    }}}And this is the decrypter JAVA program:public class Main {    //output file name after decryptionprivate static String decryptedFileName;//input encrypted fileprivate static String fileSource;//a prefix tag for output file nameprivate static String outputFilePrefix = \"decrypted_\";//My key for decryption, its the same as in the encrypter program.static byte[] key = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 };//Decrypting functionpublic static void decrypt(byte[] key, File inputFile, File outputFile) throws Exception {    try {        Key secretKey = new SecretKeySpec(key, \"AES\");        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES\");        cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, secretKey);        FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream(inputFile);        byte[] inputBytes = new byte[(int) inputFile.length()];        inputStream.read(inputBytes);        byte[] outputBytes = cipher.doFinal(inputBytes);        FileOutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream(outputFile, true);        outputStream.write(outputBytes);        inputStream.close();        outputStream.close();    } catch (Exception ex) {        ex.printStackTrace();    }}//first argument is the intput file sourcepublic static void main(String[] args) {    if (args.length != 1) {        System.out.println(\"Add log file name as a parameter.\");    } else {        fileSource = args[0];        try {            File sourceFile = new File(fileSource);            if (sourceFile.exists()) {                                //Decrption                decryptedFileName = outputFilePrefix + sourceFile.getName();                File decryptedFile = new File(decryptedFileName);                decrypt(key, sourceFile, decryptedFile);            } else {                System.out.println(\"Log file not found: \" + fileSource);            }        } catch (Exception e) {            e.printStackTrace();        }        System.out.println(\"Decryption done, output file: \" + decryptedFileName);    }}}Output decrypted log (Opened with notepad++):There is the valid content, but you also can see the extra thrash characters. If I open with the default windows text editor i also got thrash charaters, but different ones.This is my first try with encrypt -decrypt, what m i doing wrong?Any ideas?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: You are reading each byte individually and then trying to calculate the length from the first 3 bytes. Instead, you should read the first 3 bytes and then read the rest of the data in larger chunks. This will improve the performance.\n\nHere's the modified code:\n\nRead the first 3 bytes and calculate the length:\n```java\nint b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\nif (b != 3) {\n    success = false;\n    break;\n}\nlength = (lengthBuffer[0] & 0xFF) | (lengthBuffer[1] & 0xFF) << 8 | lengthBuffer[2] << 16;\n```\nRead the rest of the data in larger chunks:\n```java\nint b = is.read(buffer, 0, length);\nif (b < 0) {\n    success = false;\n    break;\n}\nbuffer = new byte[length];\nis.read(buffer, 0, length);\n```\nThis way, you can take advantage of the optimizations that InputStream provides for reading larger chunks of data, rather than reading each byte individually.\n\nRegarding the extra characters in the decrypted log, it's difficult to say without more information about the encryption and decryption process. However, it's possible that the encryption and decryption algorithms are not compatible or there is an issue with the key used for encryption and decryption. You may want to double-check the encryption and decryption algorithms and make sure that the key used is the same for both."}
