Try to just use the value of the foreach inside the loop.\nQuestion: How to return all properties of a node with their name and their value using Cypher: :I saw here : How can I return all properties for a node using Cypher? that somebody already asked this question, but 1 year ago.So i need to ask it now : is there a way, today, to return all properties of a node using cypher? i need to do it for a translation system where previous developpers have created it as 1 node per language, with contains all of the properties with their name in the desired language. I need to get it for a Java application.Example:node FR contains: \"Salut_01\" : \"Bonjour\"node UK contains: \"Salut_01\" : \"Hello\"etc...\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Neo4j\n<<<code>>>: MATCH (n:Node {language: \"FR\"})-[:CONTAINS]->(prop:Property) RETURN n.name AS node_name, prop.name AS property_name, prop.value AS property_value;\n<<<explanation>>>: This Cypher query will return all properties of the node with the label \"Node\" and the property name \"language\" equal to \"FR\", along with their respective values. You can modify the query to include other nodes and properties as needed."}
