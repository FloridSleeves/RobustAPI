The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: How to read/write a 2d char array through a Socket?: :So I am writing a game of LAN tic-tac-toe. I have the \"board\" stored as a 2 dimensional char array. I want to be able to send and receive this array through Sockets. I am currently using a InputStream and OutputStream to send single bytes. However, I don't think this will work for sending the array. Also, these streams only seem capable of sending int type data. Can someone please explain to me how too send 2 dimensional char arrays over sockets using I/O streams. Example code would be great! Thanks. Current Code:public void communicate() {    try {        OutputStream os = client.getOutputStream();        InputStream is = client.getInputStream();    }    while (gameOver == false) {        char[][] board = new char[3][3];        try {            os.write(board); //this dosen't work, only sends non-array int types.         } catch (IOException e) {            e.printStackTrace();        }    }}\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: public class GameCommunication {\npublic static void sendBoard(char[][] board) {\ntry {\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\nByteArrayOutputStream bos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\nint bytesRead = 0;\nwhile ((bytesRead = is.read(buffer)) != -1) {\nbos.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);\n}\nbyte[] byteArray = bos.toByteArray();\nis.close();\nbos.close();\n} catch (IOException e) {\ne.printStackTrace();\n}\n}\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: You can use the ByteArrayOutputStream to convert the char[][] board into a byte array, which can then be sent over the socket. The InputStream.read() method reads the data from the socket and writes it to the ByteArrayOutputStream. Once the data is sent, the byte array can be converted back into a char[][] board using the ByteArrayInputStream."}
