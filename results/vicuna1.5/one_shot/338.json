Try to just use the value of the foreach inside the loop.\nQuestion: How to get one element from LinkedHashSet in Java?: :I'm looking to write code that partitions a given set into disjoint subsets. For example, a set of football players and we partition them depending on the team they belong to. I want in the end a list of representatives, i.e. one player from each team.All football players know all other player on their team -- this is very relevant for the complexity. So, my current idea on how to do this is as follows (where set is currently a LinkedHashSet<T>): while (!set.isEmpty()) {    E e = set.iterator().next();    makeRepresentative(e);    set.remove(AllPlayersOnSameTeamAs(e));}However, it feels weird to build a new iterator in every step of the while-loop. A LinkedHashSet is supposed to have some kind of firstElement() function internally (for its LinkedList behaviour), but for some reason I can't find how to do this. I also tried a foreach loop instead, but that resulted in a java.util.ConcurrentModificationException. How am I supposed to do this correctly?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: for(Iterator<E> it = set.iterator(); it.hasNext(); ){\nE element = it.next();\nmakeRepresentative(element);\nset.remove(AllPlayersOnSameTeamAs(element));\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You can use a for-each loop to iterate through the LinkedHashSet and remove elements as you go. The `Iterator.next()` is not necessary as you can get the next element using the `Iterator.next()` method inside the loop."}
