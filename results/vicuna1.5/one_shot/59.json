{"api": "BufferedReader.readLine", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: I am trying to read lines of text from the console. The number of lines is not known in advance. The BufferedReader.readLine() method reads a line but after the last line it waits for input from the console. What should be done in order to avoid this?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: public static String[] getLinesFromConsole() {\n    String strLine = \"\";\n    try {\n    // Get the object of DataInputStream\n    InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);\n    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);\n    String line = \"\";\n    while ((line = br.readLine()) != null && !line.equals(\"exit\") )\n        strLine += br.readLine() + \"~\";\n        isr.close();                                                        \n    } catch (IOException ioe) {\n        ioe.printStackTrace();                                \n    }\n    return strLine.split(\"~\");\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The below code might fix, replace text exit with your requirement specific string.\nQuestion: Read file and get key=value without using java.util.Properties: :I'm building a RMI game and the client would load a file that has some keys and values which are going to be used on several different objects. It is a save game file but I can't use java.util.Properties for this (it is under the specification). I have to read the entire file and ignore commented lines and the keys that are not relevant in some classes. These properties are unique but they may be sorted in any order. My file current file looks like this:# BioplayerOrigin=NewlandsplayerClass=Warlock# ArmorplayerHelmet=emptyplayerUpperArmor=armor900playerBottomArmor=armor457playerBoots=boot109etcThese properties are going to be written and placed according to the player's progress and the filereader would have to reach the end of file and get only the matched keys. I've tried different approaches but so far nothing came close to the results that I would had using java.util.Properties. Any idea?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: public static Map<String, String> readFileWithoutProperties() throws IOException {\nString fileContent = \"\";\nBufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"file.txt\"));\nString line = \"\";\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\nif (!line.startsWith(\"#\") && !line.isEmpty()) {\nfileContent += line + \"\\n\";\n}\n}\nbr.close();\nreturn fileContent.split(\"\\n\")\n.stream()\n.collect(Collectors.toMap(line -> line.split(\"=\")[0], line -> line.split(\"=\")[1]));\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The above code reads the entire file and ignores commented lines and keys that are not relevant in some classes. It uses the BufferedReader.readLine() method to read each line of the file and checks if the line starts with \"#\" or is empty. If it is not, it adds the line to the fileContent variable. Finally, it uses the split() method to split each line by \"=\" and collects the keys and values in a map using the Collectors.toMap() method."}
