The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: JAVA: writing and reading buffer from serial using RXTX: :I've got strange results when I'mt trying to read string buffer from serial com using RXTX.After writing a string to COM I've to store the string as reply. And this is inside a loop. The string printed in console sometimes not corrispond to the last write command but belong to the previus one.     while (running) {          char campioni = (char) start;          hexStart = Integer.toHexString(campioni).toUpperCase();          String stringa = \">eL#\" + hexStart + \"??!\\r\\n\" + \"\\n\";          output.write((\">eL\" + \"L#\" + hexStart + \"??!\\r\\n\").getBytes());          output.flush();           byte[] buffer = new byte[10000];           n=0;       try {          n = input.read(buffer);        } catch (IOException e1) {        e1.printStackTrace();        }             if(n>0){                    String data = new String (buffer,0,n);                    System.out.println(new String(buffer));                    start=start+5;                    Thread.sleep(2000);                }          }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] buffer = new byte[10000];\nint n = 0;\ntry {\nn = input.read(buffer);\n} catch (IOException e) {\ne.printStackTrace();\n}\nString data = new String(buffer, 0, n);\nSystem.out.println(data);\nstart = start + 5;\nThread.sleep(2000);\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are using a fixed buffer size of 10000 bytes for reading from the serial port. This means that if the incoming data does not fit into the buffer, the read() method will block until more data is available. However, if the incoming data is larger than the buffer size, it will be truncated, which could cause issues with the string you are trying to read.\n\nTo fix this, you should use a buffer size that is large enough to hold the entire incoming message. You can do this by using the available() method to check how much data is available in the input stream, and then use that information to calculate the appropriate buffer size.\n\nFor example:\n```\nfinal byte[] buffer = new byte[input.available()];\nint n = 0;\ntry {\n    n = input.read(buffer);\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\nString data = new String(buffer, 0, n);\nSystem.out.println(data);\nstart = start + 5;\nThread.sleep(2000);\n```\nThis way, the read() method will read as much data as is available in the input stream, and you will not have to worry about buffer overflows or truncated data."}
