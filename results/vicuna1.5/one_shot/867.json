USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Why is RandomAccessFile writeLong implemented with multiple write calls?: While profiling an application I noticed that RandomAccessFile.writeLong was taking a lot of time.\n\nI checked the code for this method, and it involves eight calls of the native method write. I wrote an alternative implementation for writeLong using a byte[]. Something like this:\n\nRandomAccessFile randomAccessFile = new RandomAccessFile(\"out.dat\", \"rwd\");\n...\nbyte[] aux = new byte[8];\naux[0] = (byte) ((l >>> 56) & 0xFF);\naux[1] = (byte) ((l >>> 48) & 0xFF);\naux[2] = (byte) ((l >>> 40) & 0xFF);\naux[3] = (byte) ((l >>> 32) & 0xFF);\naux[4] = (byte) ((l >>> 24) & 0xFF);\naux[5] = (byte) ((l >>> 16) & 0xFF);\naux[6] = (byte) ((l >>> 8) & 0xFF);\naux[7] = (byte) ((l >>> 0) & 0xFF);\nrandomAccessFile.write(aux);\n\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: RandomAccessFile.write\n<<<code>>>: {\n    RandomAccessFile raf = new RandomAccessFile(\"test.dat\", \"rwd\");\n    int longCount = 10000;\n    long start = System.nanoTime();\n    for (long l = 0; l < longCount; l++)\n        raf.writeLong(l);\n    long time = System.nanoTime() - start;\n    System.out.printf(\"writeLong() took %,d us on average%n\", time / longCount / 1000);\n    raf.close();\n}\n{\n    RandomAccessFile raf = new RandomAccessFile(\"test2.dat\", \"rwd\");\n    int longCount = 10000;\n    long start = System.nanoTime();\n    byte[] aux = new byte[8];\n    try {\n        for (long l = 0; l < longCount; l++) {\n            aux[0] = (byte) (l >>> 56);\n            aux[1] = (byte) (l >>> 48);\n            aux[2] = (byte) (l >>> 40);\n            aux[3] = (byte) (l >>> 32);\n            aux[4] = (byte) (l >>> 24);\n            aux[5] = (byte) (l >>> 16);\n            aux[6] = (byte) (l >>> 8);\n            aux[7] = (byte) l;\n            \n            raf.write(aux);\n            \n        }\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    }\n    long time = System.nanoTime() - start;\n    System.out.printf(\"write byte[8] took %,d us on average%n\", time / longCount / 1000);\n    raf.close();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: It appears that the RandomAccessFile.writeLong() doesn't minimise the number of calls to the OS. The cost increases dramatically by using \"rwd\" instead of \"rw\" which should be enough to indicate its not the calls themselves which cost the time. (its the fact the OS is try to commit every write to disk and the disk only spins so fast)\nQuestion: Creating Random Access File for Bank: :I need help with the following parts which I know are wrong: The spaces/truncating - I have no idea how to do thisThe file.seek - Probably wrong since I am not spacing/truncating to 8 characters.Here is my code:import java.io.BufferedReader;import java.io.InputStreamReader;import java.io.RandomAccessFile;public class NationalBank{  public static void main(String[] args)    {  InputStreamReader temp = null;  BufferedReader input = null;  try  {     temp = new InputStreamReader(System.in);     input = new BufferedReader(temp);     int acct;     double amount[] = new double[9999];     String name[] = new String[9999];     RandomAccessFile file = new RandomAccessFile(\"bank.txt\", \"rw\");     while(true)     {        System.out.println(\"Enter Account Number (0-9999): \");        acct = Integer.parseInt(input.readLine());        System.out.println(\"Enter Last Name: \");        name[acct] = input.readLine();        System.out.println(\"Enter Balance \");        amount[acct] = Double.parseDouble(input.readLine());        if(acct >=0 && acct <=9999) {           file.seek(acct*10);           file.writeBytes(\" \"+name[acct]);           file.writeBytes(\" \"+amount[acct]);        }        System.out.println(\"Enter More? (y/n)\");           if (input.readLine().toLowerCase().equals(\"n\"))           break;     }     file.close();  }     catch (Exception e)     {       }   }}\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: RandomAccessFile.write\n<<<code>>>: {\nRandomAccessFile file = new RandomAccessFile(\"bank.txt\", \"rw\");\nint count = 10000;\nlong start = System.nanoTime();\nfor (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {\nfile.writeBytes(\" \" + name[i]);\nfile.writeBytes(\" \" + amount[i]);\n}\nlong time = System.nanoTime() - start;\nSystem.out.printf(\"Writing to file took %,d us on average%n\", time / count / 1000);\nfile.close();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The code you provided for writing to the bank.txt file is incorrect. You are not seeking to the correct position in the file and you are not truncating the file before writing. Also, you are not closing the file after writing.\n\nTo fix the issue, you should seek to the correct position in the file before writing, and you should close the file after writing. You should also consider using the \"rw\" mode instead of \"rw\" to minimize the number of calls to the OS."}
