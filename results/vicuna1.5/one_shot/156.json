USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Android InputStream.read() horribly slow:I'm working on an Android app that needs to communicate with a server (running on my PC) which is also written by me. The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Monitoring BufferedInputStream download progress: :I'm trying to download a file using an AsyncTask on Android. I want to display a ProgressDialog which should have a progress bar to show the status of the download. I'm using the onProgressUpdate() function for that and implemented a call to publishProgress() in my doInBackground() function. However, the progress dialog only pops up after downloading the file. My code:protected Long doInBackground(URL...urls) {    for (int i = 0; i < urls.length; i++) {        url = urls[i];        try {            URLConnection conn = url.openConnection();            conn.connect();            totalSize = conn.getContentLength();            BufferedInputStream bis = new BufferedInputStream(url.openStream());            FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().getPath() + \"/forvo_temp.mp3\");            BufferedOutputStream bos = new BufferedOutputStream(fos,1024);            byte [] data = new byte[1024];            int x=0; int c=0;            while((x=bis.read(data,0,1024))>=0){                bos.write(data,0,x);                c += 1024;                publishProgress(c);            }        } catch (Exception e) {            e.printStackTrace();        }    }    return 0L; // Don't know what to do with this}protected void onProgressUpdate(Integer...args) {    pd = ProgressDialog.show(context, \"Downloading...\", \"Downloading...\", true, false);    pd.setProgress(args[0] / totalSize);}I guess the whole file is downloaded when I call new BufferedInputStream(url.openStream()). How can I monitor the download progress?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: You can use the following code to monitor the download progress:\n```scss\nprotected Long doInBackground(URL...urls) {\n    for (int i = 0; i < urls.length; i++) {\n        url = urls[i];\n        try {\n            URLConnection conn = url.openConnection();\n            conn.connect();\n            totalSize = conn.getContentLength();\n            InputStream inputStream = url.openStream();\n            BufferedInputStream bis = new BufferedInputStream(inputStream);\n            FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().getPath() + \"/forvo_temp.mp3\");\n            BufferedOutputStream bos = new BufferedOutputStream(fos, 1024);\n            byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\n            int bytesRead = 0;\n            int totalBytes = 0;\n            while ((bytesRead = bis.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n                totalBytes += bytesRead;\n                publishProgress((int) (totalBytes / totalSize * 100));\n                bos.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);\n            }\n            bis.close();\n            bis = null;\n            bos.close();\n            fos.close();\n            fos = null;\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n    return 0L; // Don't know what to do with this\n}\n```\nThis code reads the input stream in chunks of 1024 bytes and calculates the progress as a percentage of the total file size. It then publishes this progress to the onProgressUpdate() function, which updates the progress dialog.\n\nThe code also closes the input and output streams after use to release resources.\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The key to monitoring the download progress is to read the input stream in chunks and calculate the progress as a percentage of the total file size. This allows you to update the progress dialog with the current status of the download.
