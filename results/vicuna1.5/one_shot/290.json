Try to just use the value of the foreach inside the loop.\nQuestion: Java: Using Iterator in Switch Statement: :I want to cycle through an ArrayList<String> named fileContent, using the Iterator interface, and I want it to be analyzed one string at a time which should result in a specific state by the switch statement, depending on what string it is. Object token is supposed to be read as 'Table'.        void process() {        Iterator fileIterator = fileContent.iterator();        int state = 0;        Object token = null;        switch (state) {        case 0:            token = fileIterator.next();            if (token.equals(\"Table\")) {                System.out.println(token);                state = 1;            } else {                System.err.println(\"Corrupt file format at state 0: \"+ token);                System.exit(0);            }            break;        }    }This doesn't switch state to 1, instead it prints out:'Corrupt file format at state 0: Table'So it seems as it reads the Object token correctly as 'Table' but not for the statement 'if (token.equals(\"Table\"))'. I have also tried 'if (token == (\"Table\"))'Can somebody help me?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: for(Iterator<String> it = fileContent.iterator(); it.hasNext(); ){\n    token = it.next();\n    if (token.equals(\"Table\")) {\n        System.out.println(token);\n        state = 1;\n    } else {\n        System.err.println(\"Corrupt file format at state 0: \"+ token);\n        System.exit(0);\n    }\n    break;\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The issue is that you are modifying the state variable inside the loop, which causes the loop to continue and the next iteration to start with the value of state that was modified. To fix this, you should declare state as a local variable within the if statement, or move the if statement outside of the loop."}
