My data format is a INT, DOUBLE, and INT[] and here's how I did it at first//to convert to stringString[] message = { Integer.toString(number), String.valueOf(double), Arrays.toString(my_list) };message.asString;//to convert backString message_without_brackets = message.replace(\"[\", \"\" ).replace(\"]\", \"\");String[] temp_message = message_without_brackets.split(\",\"); int interger = Integer.valueOf(temp_message[0]);double double = Double.valueOf(temp_message[1]);int[] my_list = new int[temp_message.length-2]; //-2 because the first two entries are other datafor (int i = 2; i < temp_message.length; i++) {    my_list[i-2] = Integer.parseInt(temp_message[i].replace(\" \",\"\"));}This is super ugly and it annoyed me that after a few weeks(or a single night of heavy drinking) I would probably not be able to figure out this quickly.  Performance wise the code wasn't too bad, I think replace was the heaviest part of the code(if I remember it was like 15% of overall execution).I asked around and found Gson to be able to do this cleaner but the performance is now over 40% of my loop now(its Gson itself thats doing it):    Gson gson = new Gson();    int[] sub = { 0, 59, 16 };    Object[] values = { 0, 43.0, sub };    String output = gson.toJson(values); // => [0, 43.0,[0,59,16]]    Object[] deserialized = gson.fromJson(output, Object[].class);    System.out.println(deserialized[0]);    System.out.println(deserialized[1]);    System.out.println(deserialized[2]);So I'm wondering if there's faster way to get the same result?I am trying out a few of the suggestions in this question but is there a faster way to do this without depending on any external libraries as my needs are quite simple(if not, then is there a fast one)?  Because someone suggested Gson, I looked at Json parsers, but is that what I should be looking for or is are there other types of libraries that do this?EDIT: I am converting it to string because I thought I needed to do that to send it as getBytes(), is there any other format that would be faster that I can use getBytes() on?\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: DataOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>: private void buildDataPart(DataOutputStream dataOutputStream, String parameterName, String parameterValue) throws IOException {\ndataOutputStream.writeBytes(twoHyphens + boundary + lineEnd);\ndataOutputStream.writeBytes(\"Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\" + parameterName);\ndataOutputStream.writeBytes(lineEnd);\ndataOutputStream.writeBytes(parameterValue);\ndataOutputStream.writeBytes(lineEnd);\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: To convert your data quickly to a byte format and back to its original form, you can use the DataOutputStream.write method. This method allows you to write data to a stream in a binary format, which can be more efficient than converting to a string and then back to the original data type.\n\nIn your case, you can create a DataOutputStream and use its write method to write your data as bytes. For example, to convert an INT data type, you can create an Integer object, get its value as bytes using the getBytes method, and then write those bytes to the DataOutputStream. Similarly, for a DOUBLE data type, you can create a Double object and get its value as bytes using the getBytes method.\n\nTo convert a String data type, you can use the getBytes method to get the bytes representation of the string and then write those bytes to the DataOutputStream.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use the DataOutputStream.write method to convert an Integer data type:\n```kotlin\nint number = 123;\nDataOutputStream dataOutputStream = new DataOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(\"data.bin\"));\ndataOutputStream.writeInt(number);\ndataOutputStream.close();\n```\nYou can use a similar approach to convert other data types. Once you have the data as bytes, you can read it back into the original data type using the DataInputStream.read method.\n\nIn terms of external libraries, using the DataOutputStream and DataInputStream methods is a built-in solution that doesn't require any external dependencies. However, if you need more advanced features or better performance, you may want to consider using a library like Gson or JsonParser, which can parse and generate JSON data, which is a common data interchange format."}
