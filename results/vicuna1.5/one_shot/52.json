{"api": "BufferedReader.readLine", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: I am trying to read lines of text from the console. The number of lines is not known in advance. The BufferedReader.readLine() method reads a line but after the last line it waits for input from the console. What should be done in order to avoid this?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: public static String[] getLinesFromConsole() {\n    String strLine = \"\";\n    try {\n    // Get the object of DataInputStream\n    InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);\n    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);\n    String line = \"\";\n    while ((line = br.readLine()) != null && !line.equals(\"exit\") )\n        strLine += br.readLine() + \"~\";\n        isr.close();                                                        \n    } catch (IOException ioe) {\n        ioe.printStackTrace();                                \n    }\n    return strLine.split(\"~\");\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The below code might fix, replace text exit with your requirement specific string.\nQuestion: Reading data from text line by line in java: :I'm making a game in Java, but can't figure out how to get information from a text file so that I can load the game. I have the saved files set up so that on every line there is the name of a method in my Main program. What I need to do is to look in a certain line for text and execute the method that the text is referring to.\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: public static void loadFromFile(String fileName) {\nBufferedReader br = null;\ntry {\nbr = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(fileName));\nString line = \"\";\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\nif (line.equals(\"your method name here\")) {\n// execute method\n}\n}\n} catch (IOException ioe) {\nioe.printStackTrace();\n} finally {\nif (br != null) {\nbr.close();\n}\n}\n}\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: You can use the BufferedReader.readLine() method to read lines of text from a file. In this case, you should check if the line contains the method name you're looking for and execute the corresponding method in the Main program."}
