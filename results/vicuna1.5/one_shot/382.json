Try to just use the value of the foreach inside the loop.\nQuestion: Search through arraylist, remove item from arraylist, add it elsewhere: :public void drop (String name) - if appropriate, remove the item from the ArrayList and add it to the current room. Update the game\u2019s message with one of the following options: 1) the player is not holding that item, 2) the room already has an item, or 3) the player has successfully dropped the item in the room.  This is the goal of this method but when I run it it always skipps to the currentMessage in the else statement.PROBLEM:The problem I am hacing is that when I run this method and try to drop an Item in a room, it doesnt and skips to the else statement and resturns the message \"you do not have that item\", and I do not know why it is doing this and not working through the first if statement because I am typing an items name I know is in the arraylist.public void drop(String name){          for(Item count : myArray){        if(count.getName().contains(name) && currentRoom.hasItem() == false){            currentRoom.addItem(count);            currentMessage = \"you have successfully dropped the item in the room\";            myArray.remove(count);        }        else if(count.getName().contains(name) && currentRoom.hasItem() == true)        {            currentMessage = \"the room already has an item\";        }        else         {            currentMessage = \"you do not have that item\";        }    }}\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: for(Iterator<Item> it = myArray.iterator(); it.hasNext(); ){\n    Item count = it.next();\n    if(count.getName().contains(name) && currentRoom.hasItem() == false){\n        currentRoom.addItem(count);\n        currentMessage = \"you have successfully dropped the item in the room\";\n        myArray.remove(count);\n    }\n    else if(count.getName().contains(name) && currentRoom.hasItem() == true)\n    {\n        currentMessage = \"the room already has an item\";\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        currentMessage = \"you do not have that item\";\n    }\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem with your code is that you are using the value of the iterator in the if statement, but you are not using it in the else if statement. Also, you are using the value of the iterator in the for loop, but you are not using it in the if statement. You should use the value of the iterator in the if statement and use the value of the iterator in the else if statement."}
