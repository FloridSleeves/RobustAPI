Try to just use the value of the foreach inside the loop.\nQuestion: Generating Random integers within a range to meet a percentile in java: :I am trying to generate random integers within a range to sample a percentile of that range. For example: for range 1 to 100 I would like to select a random sample of 20%. This would result in 20 integers randomly selected for 100. This is to solve an extremely complex issue and I will post solutions once I get this and a few bugs worked out. I have not used many math packages in java so I appreciate your assistance.Thanks!\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Random.nextInt()\n<<<code>>>: for(Iterator<DataSnapshot> it = dataSnapshot.getChildren().iterator(); it.hasNext(); ){\nint randomValue = Random.nextInt(100);\nif(randomValue <= 20){\nnames.add(it.next().getValue(String.class));\n}\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You can use the Random.nextInt() method to generate a random integer within a range. In your case, you want to generate a random integer between 1 and 100 and make sure it's less than or equal to 20. You can use the if statement to check if the random value is within the desired range and add the corresponding value to the list."}
