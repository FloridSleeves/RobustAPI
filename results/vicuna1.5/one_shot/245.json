USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Android InputStream.read() horribly slow:I'm working on an Android app that needs to communicate with a server (running on my PC) which is also written by me. The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: How to convert boolean array to binary and vice versa in Java?: :What is the most efficient way to output a boolean array to (and input from) a file in Java? I was going to use a string with each character being either 't' or 'f' and then I thought, why not take eight time less space?NOTEI actually have no idea which answer is the better method, I've just chosen Peter's because I understand it. Thanks to both answerers!\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\nint b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\nif (b == 3) {\n// do your length calculation\nfinal byte buffer = new byte[length];\nb = is.read(buffer);\n// check b and then you have your bytes\n} else {\nsuccess = false;\nbreak;\n}\n} catch (IOException e) {\nSystem.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: This code reads the first 3 bytes from the InputStream and checks if it is equal to 3. If it is, it calculates the length of the data to be read and then reads the next block of data. This way, you can read blocks of data rather than one byte at a time, which is more efficient. Also, you are not allocating a mega array like you previously had."}
