The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: String base64 decoded un-gziped from little-endian 4-byte int to java int: :I'm trying to implement TMX files in Android and I was hoping someone could help. Based on the TMX guide, in order to get the GID's I have to first base64 decode the string, then gunzip the resulting data if the compression attribute is set to \"gzip\" as in the above example. Finally, you can read 4 bytes at a time for each GID from the beginning of the data stream until the end.I think I've figured out the base64 decoding and 'gunzip' but the result from the code below is 27,0,0,0 repeating. I think the output is supposed to be (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) Thanks! public static void main( String[] args ) { String myString = \"H4sIAAAAAAAAAO3NoREAMAgEsLedAfafE4+s6l0jolNJiif18tt/Fj8AAMC9ARtYg28AEAAA\"; byte[] decode = Base64.decodeBase64(myString); ByteArrayInputStream byteArrayInputStream = new ByteArrayInputStream(decode);  GZIPInputStream gzipInputStream; int read; try {      gzipInputStream = new GZIPInputStream(byteArrayInputStream);      InputStreamReader inputStreamReader = new InputStreamReader(gzipInputStream);      BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(inputStreamReader, 4);      while ( ( read = bufferedReader.read() ) != -1 )      {           System.out.println(\"read :\" + read);      } } catch (IOException e) {      e.printStackTrace(); } }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: byte[] buffer = new byte[4];\nint read = is.read(buffer);\nif (read == -1) {\n// handle the end of the stream\n} else {\nint gid = buffer[0] | (buffer[1] << 8) | (buffer[2] << 16) | (buffer[3] << 24);\n// do something with gid\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: Instead of reading one byte at a time, you should read 4 bytes at a time to get the 4-byte int. Then you can decode the int to get the GID. Also, you should check if the read operation returned -1 to indicate the end of the stream."}
