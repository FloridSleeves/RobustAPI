The `ListView` widget allows you to display a list of items in a scrollable list. You can use the `List.get` method to get the last item in the list and display it initially. Then, you can use a `Button` widget with a `onPressed` callback to trigger the display of the next item in the list when the button is clicked.\n\nHere is an example of how you can use the `ListView` and `Button` widgets to display a list of items with a next button:\n```\nclass MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {\n  final List<String> items;\n\n  MyWidget({this.items});\n\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return Scaffold(\n      appBar: AppBar(\n        title: Text('My Widget'),\n      ),\n      body: ListView.builder(\n        itemCount: items.length,\n        itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int index) {\n          return ListTile(\n            title: Text(items[index]),\n          );\n        },\n      ),\n      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(\n        onPressed: () {\n          // Display the next item in the list\n          setState(() {\n            items.insert(items.length, 'Next Item');\n          });\n        },\n        child: Icon(Icons.arrow_forward),\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\nIn this example, the `MyWidget` class has a `ListView.builder` widget that displays each item in the `items` list as a `ListTile` widget. The `FloatingActionButton` widget has an `onPressed` callback that inserts the string \"Next Item\" at the end of the `items` list when the button is clicked. This will cause the `ListView.builder` to display the next item in the list.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."}
