Try to just use the value of the foreach inside the loop.\nQuestion: Something like Collections.rotate for map: :Not looking for any code help just yet, just some advice.I'm devising a scheduler that takes a text file input and schedules weekly games for all teams. I have this working, and now I'm looking at expanding it to hold results. At the moment I read all the teams into a list. and use Collections.rotate to rotate the list in order to randomize the fixtures.I was thinking of using a Map to hold the team and number of wins, however rotate doesn't appear to work for map. Is there a similar function that I'm missing, or something that I have overlooked?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Map.entrySet()\n<<<code>>>: for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : map.entrySet()) {\nString key = entry.getKey();\nInteger value = entry.getValue();\n// Do something with key and value\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You can use Map.entrySet() to get a set of key-value pairs from a map, and then iterate over them using a for-each loop. This will allow you to access each key-value pair in the map and perform operations on them."}
