If the connection gets refused the thread should keep polling the port until the server is up again. How can I handle this exception and keep my thread fro crashing? The server may not be up for long time but thread should run indefinitely.public void SendMessage(String message){    try {        socket = new Socket(actuatorAddress, destPort.get());        outToServer = socket.getOutputStream();        out = new DataOutputStream(outToServer);        out.flush();        out.write(message.getBytes());    } catch (IOException ex) {        System.out.println(ex.getMessage());    } catch (Exception e) {        System.out.println(e.getMessage());    }}I changed some part of the code as below. For first time called Connect function and then subsequently called Send Message function through thread. The delay added to reconnecting helped reduce time lag recurred due to connecting to non existing server. Still think that there might be a better solution to the basic problem.public boolean ConnectToActuator() {    try {        if(actuatorAddress.isReachable(2000)){            socket = new Socket();            socket.setPerformancePreferences(1, 2, 0);            socket.setTcpNoDelay(false);            socket.setSendBufferSize(32);            socket.connect(new InetSocketAddress(actuatorAddress, destPort.get()));            outToServer = socket.getOutputStream();            out = new DataOutputStream(outToServer);            connected = true;            disconnectedTimeout = 0;        }    }catch (ConnectException e) {        // TODO Auto-generated catch block        System.out.println(e.getMessage());    }catch (IOException ex) {        connected = false;        System.out.println(ex.getMessage());    }    return connected;}public boolean SendToActuator(String message) {    if(connected == false){ //socket.isOutputShutdown()        disconnectedTimeout++;        if(disconnectedTimeout>20){            disconnectedTimeout = 0;            ConnectToActuator();        } else {            return connected;        }    }    try {        out.flush();        out.writeBytes(message);        disconnectedTimeout = 0;        connected = true;    } catch (UnknownHostException uhe) {        connected = false;        System.out.println(uhe.getMessage());    } catch (IOException ioe) {        connected = false;        System.out.println(ioe.getMessage());    }    return connected;}\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: DataOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>: private void sendMessage(String message) throws IOException {\nDataOutputStream dataOutputStream = new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());\ndataOutputStream.writeBytes(twoHyphens + boundary + lineEnd);\ndataOutputStream.writeBytes(\"Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"message\\\"\");\ndataOutputStream.writeBytes(lineEnd);\ndataOutputStream.writeBytes(message);\ndataOutputStream.writeBytes(lineEnd);\ndataOutputStream.flush();\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: To send a string along with a file in Volley, you need to create a VolleyFileUploadRequest object and override its getByteData() and getParams() methods. In the getByteData() method, you need to create a MutableMap<String, FileDataPart> object and add a FileDataPart object for the file you want to send. In the getParams() method, you need to return a MutableMap<String, String> object.\n\nTo send a string without a file, you can simply create a VolleyRequest object and override its get() method to send the string as POST request data.\n\nTo connect to a remote server from a thread and keep sending strings, you can use a while loop to keep checking if the server is up. If the connection gets refused, you can increase a reconnect delay and try again after a certain amount of time. You can use the Socket class to create a new socket and connect to the server. Once the connection is established, you can use a DataOutputStream object to write the string data to the server. If an exception occurs, you can catch the exception and print an error message."}
