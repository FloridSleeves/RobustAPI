It wait for EOF but I can't send it because if I use out.close();orskt.shutdownOutput();I close the Socket and I must keep this connection alive.I can't send '\\0' becouse I get Parse Error in the server.How can I do it? Can I \"close\" the output stream without closing the socket?RESOLVEDI've created new class XMLStreamOutput and XMLStreamInput with advanced Stream gesture.\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: DataOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>: private void writeXMLData(DataOutputStream dataOutputStream, String xmlData) throws IOException {\ndataOutputStream.writeBytes(twoHyphens + boundary + lineEnd);\ndataOutputStream.writeBytes(\"Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"xmlData\\\"\");\ndataOutputStream.writeBytes(lineEnd);\ndataOutputStream.writeBytes(xmlData);\ndataOutputStream.writeBytes(lineEnd);\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: To send XML data through a socket InputStream, you can create a new class called XMLStreamOutput that extends DataOutputStream. In this class, you can override the write() method to write the XML data in the correct format. The server will receive the data and parse it as XML. This way, you can avoid the deadlock and keep the connection alive."}
