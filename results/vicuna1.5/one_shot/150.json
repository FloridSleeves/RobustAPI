USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Android InputStream.read() horribly slow:I'm working on an Android app that needs to communicate with a server (running on my PC) which is also written by me. The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: How to split binary data into hex strings when characters are in the start and end of the strings: :I want to split data based on character values which are two right parenthesis )) as start of substring and carriage return CR as the end of substring. The data comes in form of bytes Am stuck on how to split it. This is so far what I have come up with.    public class ByteDecoder {         public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {              InputStream is = null;              DataInputStream dis = null;             try{                 is = new FileInputStream(\"byte.log\");                 dis = new DataInputStream(is);                 int count = is.available();                 byte[] bs = new byte[count];                 dis.read(bs);                 for (byte b:bs)                  {                     char c = (char)b;                     System.out.println(c);                  //convert bytes to hex string                  // String c = DatatypeConverter.printHexBinary( bs);                  }                  }catch(Exception e){                    e.printStackTrace();                     }finally{                         if(is!=null)                         is.close();                         if(dis!=null)                         dis.close();          }         }}\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: public class ByteDecoder {\npublic static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\nInputStream is = new FileInputStream(\"byte.log\");\nDataInputStream dis = new DataInputStream(is);\nint count = is.available();\nbyte[] bs = new byte[count];\ndis.read(bs);\nfor (byte b : bs) {\nchar c = (char) b;\nif (c == '(' || c == ')') {\n// Convert bytes to hex string\nString hexString = DatatypeConverter.printHexBinary(bs);\nSystem.out.println(hexString.substring(0, c.length()));\n} else {\nSystem.out.println(c);\n}\n}\n}\n}\n\nExplanation:\nYou can use the DataInputStream to read the binary data and then check for the characters '(' and ')' to determine the start and end of the substring. Once you have determined the start and end of the substring, you can use the DatatypeConverter.printHexBinary method to convert the bytes to a hex string. Finally, you can use the substring method to extract the portion of the hex string that corresponds to the characters '(' and ')' and print it out."}
