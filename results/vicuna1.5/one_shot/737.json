{"api": "PrintWriter.write", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem. That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Output text to a file with a class method java: :I have a valet class method that should write an hourly wage to a file:public void hourlyOverall() throws FileNotFoundException{    PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(\"wage info\");    new FileOutputStream(\"wage info\", true);    hourlyOverall = tips / hours + hourlyWage;    out.println(hourlyOverall);}However, when I run valet.hourlyOverall() in my main method, the file \"wage info\" is created but nothing is written to it.  What am I doing wrong?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(hourlyOverall + \"\\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are not adding a line break character at the end of the string. Adding \"\\n\" at the end of the string will create a new line when the file is written to, allowing the file to be read properly."}
