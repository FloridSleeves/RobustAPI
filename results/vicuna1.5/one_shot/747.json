USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem. That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Inputting a sorted file, unsorting it, then outputting the unsorted file (Java): :This project is supposed to have 3 separate main classes. It inputs a file of a list of countries that is sorted alphabetically, it outputs an unsorted file with lines rearranged randomly.My first main class looks like this:package assignment3;import java.io.PrintWriter;import java.io.File;import java.util.Scanner;public class Assignment3 {`public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception{    Scanner stdIn = new Scanner(new File(\"C:/Users/Vicki/Desktop/CountrySortedFormat.txt\"));    PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(\"C:/Users/Vicki/Desktop/CountryUnsortedFormat.txt\");    String[] line = new String[238];    while (stdIn.hasNextLine()){            for (int k = 0; k <= line.length-1; k++){            line[k]=stdIn.nextLine();            out.println(line[k]);            out.close();        }    }  }}My code doesn't have any visible problems but I tried printing out the array and got an array of \"null\". Am I doing something wrong?EDIT: changed PrintWriter file name to CountryUnsortedFormat\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break.

This could happen if the array is not initialized properly or if some of the lines in the input file are empty or contain invalid characters.\n\nTo fix this, you can initialize the array with a default value, such as an empty string, or you can check each element before printing it to ensure that it is not null. Here is an example of how you can initialize the array with an empty string as the default value:\n```java\nString[] line = new String[238];\nwhile (stdIn.hasNextLine()) {\n    for (int k = 0; k <= line.length - 1; k++) {\n        line[k] = stdIn.nextLine();\n    }\n    out.println(line[k]);\n    out.close();\n}\n```\nThis will ensure that the array is not null and that all elements are initialized with an empty string before they are printed.\n\nAlternatively, you can check each element before printing it to ensure that it is not null:\n```java\nString[] line = new String[238];\nwhile (stdIn.hasNextLine()) {\n    String line = stdIn.nextLine();\n    if (line != null) {\n        out.println(line);\n    }\n    out.close();\n}\n```\nThis will prevent any null references from being printed to the output file."}
