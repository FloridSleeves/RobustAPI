Try to just use the value of the foreach inside the loop.\nQuestion: Signature of Collections.min/max method: :In Java, the Collections class contains the following method:public static <T extends Object & Comparable<? super T>> T min(Collection<? extends T> c)Its signature is well-known for its advanced use of generics,so much that it is mentioned in the Java in a Nutshell bookand in the official Sun Generics Tutorial.However, I could not find a convincing answer to the following question:Why is the formal parameter of type Collection<? extends T>, ratherthan Collection<T>? What's the added benefit?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Collections.min()\n<<<code>>>: Collections.min(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5));\n<<<explanation>>>: The formal parameter of type Collection<? extends T> allows for a more flexible and generic implementation of the method. By using <? extends T>, the method can work with any collection that contains elements of type T or a subclass of T, whereas using Collection<T> would only allow for collections of type T. This allows for the method to work with more types of collections, such as a List of Objects that contains Integer objects, without having to change the method signature."}
