{"api": "PrintWriter.write", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem. That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: java jasper report export to stream blank page: :I use jasper reports version 6.2.1 with the following configuration:HttpServletResponse response = (HttpServletResponse) FacesContext.getCurrentInstance().getExternalContext().getResponse(); JREmptyDataSource jasper = new JREmptyDataSource(); JasperPrint jasperPrint = jasperFillManager.fillReport(this.getClass().getClassLoader().getResource(\"/reports/tn2.jasper\").getPath(), null, jasper);response.setContentType(\"application/pdf\");response.setHeader(\"Content-Disposition\", \"attachment\" + \"; filename=hehe.pdf\");ByteArrayOutputStream finalReport = new ByteArrayOutputStream();JasperExportManager.exportReportToPdfStream(jasperPrint,finalReport);PrintWriter ouputStream = response.getWriter();ouputStream.write(new String(finalReport.toByteArray()));ouputStream.flush();FacesContext.getCurrentInstance().responseComplete();I do it from my JSF 2.x backing bean.But I always get a blank page when try to export to stream. But if I do:JasperExportManager.exportReportToPdfFile(jasperPrint,                                \"d://hehe.pdf\");it works ok, I see the content in the generated file. How to force it work with streams? I tried to close/flush streams in different configurations, use ARM, etc. No luck so far\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\"); printWriter.write(\"2\"); printWriter.write(\"3\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The issue is that you are writing multiple lines without adding a line break between them. BufferedReader expects a line break to indicate the end of a line, so it reads the entire buffer as a single line. To fix this, you need to add a line break between each line you write.\n\nRegarding the second question, it seems that the issue is with the way you are exporting the report to a stream. When you export to a file, Jasper Report generates a PDF file and writes it to the file system. When you export to a stream, Jasper Report generates a PDF stream and writes it to the response object's output stream. The issue could be that the PDF stream is not being properly generated or written to the output stream.\n\nOne possible solution is to use the `JasperExportManager.exportReportToPdfStream` method to export the report to a byte array, and then write the byte array to the response object's output stream using the `PrintWriter.write` method. Here's an example:\n```java\nByteArrayOutputStream finalReport = new ByteArrayOutputStream();\nJasperExportManager.exportReportToPdfStream(jasperPrint, finalReport);\nbyte[] pdfBytes = finalReport.toByteArray();\nPrintWriter outputStream = response.getWriter();\noutputStream.write(pdfBytes);\noutputStream.flush();\n```\nThis should write the PDF stream to the response object's output stream, and should avoid the issue of generating a blank page."}
