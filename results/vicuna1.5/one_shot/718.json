{"api": "PrintWriter.write", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem. That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Does a PrintWriter / PrintStream need to be flushed?: :I'd like to use a PrintWriter or PrintStream to write formatted strings out to an outputstream (for which I have no control over the creation).  However flushing the underlying OutputStream has a big performance hit.Does a PrintWriter / PrintStream need to be flushed.If I need to flush the PrintStream / PrintWriter; can I do so without flushing the underlying OutputStream, or will I need to create a \"flush protecter\" OutputStream to wrap the underlying stream?To try to be a little clearer on this I want to implement public void writeSomeString(OutputStream foo);But this method may be called many times for the same OutputStream (foo).  Each call will have to construct its own PrintWriter.  I know it's ugly to do so but I have no control over the interface or the creation of foo.I'm trying to avoid each method having to flush foo just to flush its own PrintWriter / PrintStream.So I want to:public void writeSomeString(OutputStream foo) {    PrintStream s = new PrintStream(foo);    s.println(\"bar\");    // other code}I want to completely avoid this method flushing foo \nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though. To fix this, you need to add a line break character at the end of the string you are writing. In this case, it should be a newline character \"\\n\"."}
