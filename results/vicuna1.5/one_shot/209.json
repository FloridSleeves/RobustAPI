USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Android InputStream.read() horribly slow:I'm working on an Android app that needs to communicate with a server (running on my PC) which is also written by me. The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: How to stream url from .pls file with java?: :I want to stream a radio with Java, my approach is to download the playlist file (.pls), then extract one of the urls given in that same file and finally, stream it with java. However, it seems I cannot find a way to do it.. I tried with JMF, but I get java.io.IOException: Invalid Http response everytime I run the code.Here is what I tried:Player player = Manager.createPlayer(new URL(\"http://50.7.98.106:8398\"));player.start();The .pls file:[playlist]NumberOfEntries=1File1=http://50.7.98.106:8398/In the piece of code above I'm setting the URL by hand, just for testing, but I've sucessfuly done the .pls downloading code and it's working, and from this I make another question, is it a better approach to just simply play the .pls file locally? Can it be done?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: InputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream(\"path/to/playlist.pls\");\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\nint bytesRead = inputStream.read(buffer);\nwhile (bytesRead > 0) {\ninputStream.read(buffer);\n}\nInputStream urlStream = new BufferedInputStream(inputStream);\nbyte[] urlBuffer = new byte[1024];\nint urlLength = -1;\nwhile (urlLength == -1) {\nurlLength = urlStream.read(urlBuffer);\n}\nurlStream.close();\ninputStream.close();\nString url = new String(urlBuffer, 0, urlLength);\nPlayer player = Manager.createPlayer(new URL(\"http://50.7.98.106:8398/\"));\nplayer.setURL(new URL(url));\nplayer.start();\n<<<explanation>>>: Instead of reading each byte individually, you can read a large buffer at once and then parse it to extract the URL. This way, you can take advantage of the optimizations that InputStream provides for reading blocks of data. Also, it's better to play the .pls file locally as it eliminates the need for making HTTP requests and reduces the chances of encountering errors."}
