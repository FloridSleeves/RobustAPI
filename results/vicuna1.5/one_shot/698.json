{"api": "PrintWriter.write", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem. That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: PrintWriter throwing FileNotFoundException: :I am writing a code that outputs to a text file using the PrintWriter class. However, when I try to initialize a new PrintWriter it throws a FileNotFound exception.Here are two versions of my code that both don't work, writer is initialized in the global variable as a PrintWriter.File file = new File(fileName);writer = new PrintWriter(fileName);writer.println(\"N: \" + N);writer.println(\"E: \" + E);writer.println(\"D: \" + D);writer.flush();writer.close();~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~writer = new PrintWriter(fileName);writer.println(\"N: \" + N);writer.println(\"E: \" + E);writer.println(\"D: \" + D);writer.flush();writer.close();Here is a list of the imports I'm using, am I possibly missing one?import java.text.DateFormat;import java.text.SimpleDateFormat;import java.math.*;import java.math.BigInteger;import java.util.*;import java.io.*;\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though. To fix this, you need to add a line break at the end of the string."}
