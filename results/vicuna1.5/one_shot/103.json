The server takes an input file from clients. Linux has end of line char LF, while Mac has end of line char CR, andWindows has end of line char CR+LFThe server needs as end of line char LF.

It then writes the input and output strings to a DataOutputStream, which is used to send the data to the server. The DataOutputStream is created with a ByteArrayOutputStream to ensure that the data is written to a byte array before it is sent to the server. The method also includes the necessary headers for the form data."}
