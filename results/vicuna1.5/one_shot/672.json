USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem. That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Read/write txt file for saves: :I have now written high scores to a text file at gameover, and read them at game load. The problem I have now is that the txt file highscores.txt isn't found anywhere because I haven't created it. Is it possible to have the file created whenever it isn't found? Here is the relevant code:Write highscores to file at gameover: if(gameOver == true){        sbg.enterState(5, new FadeOutTransition(), new FadeInTransition());        if(score > Highscores.highscore3 && score < Highscores.highscore2){            Highscores.highscore3 = score;        }else if(score > Highscores.highscore2 && score < Highscores.highscore1){            Highscores.highscore3 = Highscores.highscore2;            Highscores.highscore2 = score;          }else if(score > Highscores.highscore1){            Highscores.highscore3 = Highscores.highscore2;            Highscores.highscore2 = Highscores.highscore1;            Highscores.highscore1 = score;        }else Highscores.highscore1 = score;        //Write highscores to highscores.txt        try{            PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"highscores.txt\", \"UTF-8\");            writer.println(String.valueOf(Highscores.highscore1));            writer.println(String.valueOf(Highscores.highscore1));            writer.println(String.valueOf(Highscores.highscore1));            writer.close();        }catch(Exception e){            e.printStackTrace();        }        gameOver = false;        gameStart = false;    }Read highscores from highscores.txt at program start:public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException{    BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"highscores.txt\"));    String line;    while((line = in.readLine()) != null){        System.out.println(line);    }    in.close();I know that I can create a file if it doesn't exist like this:try{File save = new File(\"highscores.txt\");if (!save.exists()){    save.createNewFile();System.out.println(\"\\n----------------------------------\");System.out.println(\"The file has been created.\");System.out.println(\"------------------------------------\");}But I don't know how to do that with buffers. Please help!\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: File.createNewFile()\n<<<code>>>: try { File save = new File(\"highscores.txt\"); if (!save.exists()) { save.createNewFile(); System.out.println(\"\\n----------------------------------\"); System.out.println(\"The file has been created.\"); System.out.println(\"------------------------------------\"); } } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are trying to write to a file using PrintWriter, but the file doesn't exist, so you get an exception. To fix this, you can use the File.createNewFile() method to create the file before trying to write to it. This method creates a new file with the given name, and if the file already exists, it will not be overwritten."}
