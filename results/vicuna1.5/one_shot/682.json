{"api": "PrintWriter.write", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem. That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Writing String to Text File: :I am saving a log to a .txt file on the sdcard but once there is two lines saved, it overwrites it and starts over?Here is my code: public static String getTimestamp() {    try {        SimpleDateFormat dateFormat = new SimpleDateFormat(\"MMMdd HH:mm:ss\", Locale.getDefault());        String currentTimeStamp = dateFormat.format(new Date()); // Find todays date        return currentTimeStamp;    } catch (Exception e) {        e.printStackTrace();        return null;    }}public static void writeToLog(Context context, String string) {    String text = getTimestamp() + \" \" + string;    // ONLY SAVES TWO LINES    try {        PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(logFile, true)));        out.println(text);        out.close();    } catch (IOException e) {        Log.d(Constants.APP_NAME, e.toString());    }}As soon as you mount /data in recovery, the log files in /sdcard & /data/media/0 show the full log history but not when the device is powered on\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break.
