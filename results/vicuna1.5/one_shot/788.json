{"api": "PrintWriter.write", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem. That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Filewriter and spaces?: :I was asked to write an assignment wherein the user would be prompted to input a key and/or a value. So far, here is my code:import java.util.Scanner;import java.io.*;class bTree{    //Fields    static Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);    static boolean done = false;    public static void main(String args[])throws Exception    {        FileWriter fWriter = new FileWriter(\"data.txt\");        do        {            System.out.print(\"Enter command: \");            String enter[] = input.nextLine().split(\" \", 3);            if(enter[0].toLowerCase().equals(\"insert\"))            {                fWriter.write(enter[1] + \"\\n\" + enter[2] + \"\\n\");                fWriter.flush();            }            else if(enter[0].toLowerCase().equals(\"select\"))            {                FileReader fReader = new FileReader(\"data.txt\");                Scanner fileInput = new Scanner(fReader);                while(fileInput.hasNext() && done == false)                {                    if(fileInput.nextLine().equals(enter[1]))                    {                        System.out.println(fileInput.nextLine());                        done = true;                    }                    else                    {                        fileInput.nextLine();                    }                }                done = false;            }            else if(enter[0].toLowerCase().equals(\"update\"))            {                fWriter.write(enter[2]);                fWriter.flush();            }            else if(enter[0].toLowerCase().equals(\"exit\"))            {                System.exit(0);            }        }        while(true);    }}Problem: When i open the data.txt, there are no spaces. So if i enter \"insert 1001 gen\" and \"10001 genny\", in notepad, it would come out as \"1001gen10001genny\". Any suggestions?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though. To fix the issue, you need to add a line break after each line you write using PrintWriter.write() method."}
