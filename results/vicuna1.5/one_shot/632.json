USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to increment a Map value in Java: Say I'm creating a word frequency list, using a Map (probably a HashMap), where each key is a String with the word that's being counted and the value is an Integer that's incremented each time a token of the word is found. Can you help me with this?\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Map.get\n<<<code>>>: import java.util.HashMap;import java.util.Map;Map<String, Integer> freq = new HashMap<String, Integer>();Integer count = freq.get(word);if (count == null) {freq.put(word, 1);}else {freq.put(word, count + 1);}\n<<<explanation>>>: If you look at the API for Map, get operations usually return null when the map does not contain the requested element. Note that this will make a solution.\nQuestion: different ways of sorting ArrayList of of HashMap<String, String>: :There are many question related to this which suggests to use Comparator to compare and sort data, and I am already trying it and struggling to make it work so please don't report it as duplicate.I have an arraylist of HashMap<String, String> ArrayList<HashMap<String, String>>and having data in this list in this form,title , link and number are keys.{ {title=\"\",link=\"\",number=}, {title=\"\",link=\"\",number=}, {title=\"\",link=\"\",number=} }Example,{ {title,link,number = 8}, {title,link,number = 1}, {title,link,number = 3} }should be changed to,{ {title,link,number = 1}, {title,link,number = 3}, {title,link,number = 8} }and I wanted to sort it based on the number, I have tried this,I create a new class (as suggested in many post to create new class to compare data) which implements Comparator.public class SortData implements Comparator<ArrayList<HashMap<String, String>>> the method which is automatically implemented is ,@Override    public int compare(ArrayList<HashMap<String, String>> lhs,            ArrayList<HashMap<String, String>> rhs) {        return 0;    }Now this method suggest to use two arraylist of Hashmap to compare, but since I have only one arraylist which needs to be sorted so what should i use for the second arraylist ?my Arraylist name is SecondArray, and I want to compare each value of it with the next value, @Override        public int compare(ArrayList<HashMap<String, String>> lhs,                ArrayList<HashMap<String, String>> rhs) {                lhs = SecondArray;                rhs = // How to compare to the next value of the same Array ?             return 0;        }How should I compare the same arraylist with the next value ?Update:each Array list element has three key/value pairs, one of them is a number , I want to sort the arraylist based on that number , which means, key/value pairs which has the lowest number should be first in the array list.\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.util.Comparator\n<<<code>>>: import java.util.Comparator;import java.util.List;import java.util.Map;public class SortData implements Comparator<List<Map<String, String>>> {private static final int COMPARATOR = 1;@Overridepublic int compare(List<Map<String, String>> lhs, List<Map<String, String>> rhs) {Map<String, String> left = lhs.get(0);Map<String, String> right = rhs.get(0);if (left.get(\"number\") != right.get(\"number\")) {return COMPARATOR;}else {return 0;}return 0;}return COMPARATOR;}\n\nExplanation:\nTo sort the ArrayList of HashMap<String, String> based on the number, you can create a new class SortData that implements the Comparator interface. In the compare method, you can get the first element of the ArrayList using the get() method and compare the number value using the get() method. If the number values are not equal, return COMPARATOR, otherwise return 0. This will sort the ArrayList based on the number value."}
