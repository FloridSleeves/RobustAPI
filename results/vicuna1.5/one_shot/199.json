{"api": "InputStream.read", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Android InputStream.read() horribly slow:I'm working on an Android app that needs to communicate with a server (running on my PC) which is also written by me. The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Run a command over SSH with JSch: :I'm trying to run a command over SSH with JSch, but JSch has virtually no documentation and the examples I've found are terrible. For example, this one doesn't show code for handling the output stream. And, this one uses an ugly hack to know when to stop reading from the output stream.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: JSch.exec()\n<<<code>>>: JSch jsch = new JSch();\nSession session = jsch.getSession(\"username\", \"host\", 22);\nsession.setPassword(\"password\");\nsession.setConfig(\"StrictHostKeyChecking\", \"no\");\n\nOutputStream outputStream = session.getOutputStream();\noutputStream.write((\"command to run over SSH\").getBytes());\noutputStream.flush();\n\nInputStream inputStream = session.getInputStream();\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\nint bytesRead = -1;\n\nwhile ((bytesRead = inputStream.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n    System.out.println(new String(buffer, 0, bytesRead));\n}\n\ninputStream.close();\noutputStream.close();\nsession.close();\n\n<<<explanation>>>: This code sets up a SSH session using JSch, writes a command to run over SSH, and reads the output stream. It uses a loop to read data from the input stream in chunks of 1024 bytes and prints each chunk as a string. This way, you can handle the output stream without having to worry about reading each byte individually."}
