NOTE : At first i tried using ImageIcon to add to JPanel but it could not work hence i found this solution which lead to my current problem. I just starting programming in Java.EDIT: Here are the link to the images and I am doing a Java ApplicationI need an alternative to add a image to a JPanel. \nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: for(Iterator<DataSnapshot> it = dataSnapshot.getChildren().iterator(); it.hasNext(); ){\ni = i + 1;\nnames.add(it.next().getValue(String.class));\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You're creating a new dataSnapshot.getChildren().iterator() in every iteration of your loop.
