If you could help me out that would be great. So I need to write a program, that makes money transaction.The way i wrote it is as follows:class program{    public static void main (String[] param)throws IOException    {        intro();        System.exit(0);    }    public static void intro()throws IOException    {        PrintWriter x =new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(\"data.txt\"));        while (true)        {            Object[] possibleValues = { \"Transfer\", \"Receive\", \"Cancel\"};            Object selectedValue = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(null,\"Choose one\", \"Input\",JOptionPane.INFORMATION_MESSAGE, null, possibleValues, possibleValues[0]);            String name;            String surname;            String amount;            String info;            if(selectedValue.equals(possibleValues[0]))            {                name = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(null, \"recipients name\");                surname = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(null, \"recipients surname\");                amount = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(null, \"amount\");                info = name+surname+amount;                x.println(info);            }            else if(selectedValue.equals(possibleValues[1]))            {                String inputname;                String inputsurname;                String inputamount;                inputname = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(null, \"your name\");                inputsurname = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(null, \"your surname\");                inputamount = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(null, \"amount\");                String inputinfo = inputname + inputsurname + inputamount;                if(x.contains.String(inputinfo))                {                    JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null,\"you will recieve \"+inputamount+\"$\");                }                else                {                    JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null,\"request not found\");                }            }            else if(selectedValue.equals(possibleValues[2]))            {                x.close();                System.exit(0);            }        }    }}and everything seems to be working except for the:If (x.contains.String(inputinfo)) linebasically what this program should do is that when you're making transaction it takes down the persons firstname surname and amount you want to give them and stores it in data.txt and when the person wants to collect the money writes down his name and surname and amount he should be receiving and if that information matches to the one stored in the data.txt the program tells them that they will receive the amount but if it doesn't match then the program will tell them that request wasn't found.The part with the program storing the names and amounts in data.txt works; only the part that finds it doesn't. Please help.\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: public static void readLinesFromFile(String filePath) {\nBufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath));\nString line = \"\";\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\nSystem.out.println(line);\n}\nbr.close();\n}\n}\n\nExplanation: The above code reads lines from a file and prints them to the console. The BufferedReader.readLine() method is used to read each line of the file. The while loop continues to execute until the end of the file is reached, and the line is null. The line is then printed to the console using the println() method. Finally, the BufferedReader is closed using the close() method to ensure that the file is properly closed.\n\nTo fix the issue with the program not finding the stored information in the data.txt file, you can modify the code to read the lines from the file and store the information in an array or a list. Then, you can loop through the array or list to check if the input information matches any of the stored information. If a match is found, the program can tell the user that they will receive the amount. If no match is found, the program can tell the user that the request was not found."}
