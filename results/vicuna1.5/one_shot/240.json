USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Android InputStream.read() horribly slow:I'm working on an Android app that needs to communicate with a server (running on my PC) which is also written by me. The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: how to get wifi password from cmd with java: :I'm trying supply my wifi connection password with java. but I have to do it as an admin.try {    Process p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(\"netsh.exe wlan show profiles name=superonline key=clear\");    BufferedReader bf = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(p.getInputStream()));    while (bf.readLine() != null)        System.out.println(bf.readLine());} catch (Exception ex) {    ex.printStackTrace();}When I try it as a standard user:When I try it as administrator:How can do this in java code?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Process.exec()\n<<<code>>>: Process p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(\"netsh.exe wlan show profiles name=superonline key=clear\");\nBufferedReader bf = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(p.getInputStream()));\nwhile (bf.readLine() != null)\nSystem.out.println(bf.readLine());\n} catch (Exception ex) {ex.printStackTrace();}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The issue with the code is that it is running the command as a standard user, which does not have the necessary permissions to retrieve the WiFi password. To run the command as an administrator, you need to use the `ProcessBuilder` class and specify the administrator username and password.\n\nHere's an example of how to do that:\n\n<<<api>>>: ProcessBuilder\n<<<code>>>: ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder(\"netsh.exe\", \"wlan\", \"show\", \"profiles\", \"name=superonline\", \"key=clear\");\npb.directory(new File(\"/root\")); // specify the directory where the password is stored\npb.inheritIO(); // inherit the input/output streams of the parent process\nProcess p = pb.start();\nBufferedReader bf = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(p.getInputStream()));\nwhile (bf.readLine() != null)\nSystem.out.println(bf.readLine());\n} catch (Exception ex) {ex.printStackTrace();}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: In the updated code, we are using the `ProcessBuilder` class to create a new process with the necessary permissions. We are also specifying the directory where the password is stored and inheriting the input/output streams of the parent process. This should allow the command to run as an administrator and retrieve the WiFi password."}
