Try to just use the value of the foreach inside the loop.\nQuestion: Java doing a For loop but also using an iterator for Linked List ( \"For, While\") Loop?: :I apologize for the basic question but my newness to Java is causing me some frustration and I am unable to find an elegant way to do this from my searches.I want to iterate through a linked list using a For construct but also have an numerical iterator so that I can break the loop after a certain number of iterations.I have this LL that I am iterating through:LinkedList<SearchResult> docSearch;I tried doing it like this but then only the iterator part worked (the result was always stuck on the first entry for each iteration)for (SearchResult result : docSearch) while (iter2 < 50)  { //do stuffiter2 = iter2 + 1;}Any advice is appreciated\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: for (Iterator<SearchResult> iter = docSearch.iterator(); iter.hasNext(); ) {\nint i = 0;\nwhile (i < 50) {\niter.next();\ni++;\n}\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You can use a for loop to iterate through the LinkedList and an iterator to keep track of the current element. Inside the loop, you can call the next() method on the iterator to move to the next element in the list. To break out of the loop after 50 iterations, you can use a while loop with a condition that checks the value of i."}
