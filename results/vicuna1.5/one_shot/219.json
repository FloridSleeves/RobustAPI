The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: How can I copy a wav file from one directory to another in java?: :In my program, I have used an adaptation of an example in the documentation for the JSch package that describes how to copy files from a remote server to the local machine.  Though the program appears to work, the files seem to be corrupted in the copying process, and when I try to play them from bash, I get an error that reads \"play FAIL formats: can't open input file `79_97_729.wav': WAVE: RIFF header not found\".My copy method is as follows:public void copyFile(File file, String newName) throws JSchException, IOException{    String prefix = null;    if (new File(destination).isDirectory()){        prefix = destination + File.separator;    }    JSch jsch = new JSch();    Session session = jsch.getSession(\"username\", \"network\");    session.setUserInfo(new MyUserInfo());    session.connect();    String command = \"scp -f \" + file.getAbsolutePath();    Channel channel = session.openChannel(\"exec\");    ((ChannelExec)channel).setCommand(command);    OutputStream out = channel.getOutputStream();    InputStream in = channel.getInputStream();    channel.connect();    byte[] buf = new byte[1024];    // send '\\0'    buf[0]=0; out.write(buf, 0, 1); out.flush();    while(true){        int c=checkAck(in);        if(c!='C'){            break;        }        // read '0644 '        in.read(buf, 0, 5);        long filesize=0L;        while(true){            if(in.read(buf, 0, 1)<0){                // error                break;            }            if(buf[0]==' ')break;            filesize=filesize*10L+(long)(buf[0]-'0');        }        // send '\\0'        buf[0]=0; out.write(buf, 0, 1); out.flush();        // read a content of lfile        fos=new FileOutputStream(prefix == null ? destination : prefix + newName);        int foo;        while(true){            if(buf.length<filesize) foo=buf.length;            else foo=(int)filesize;            foo=in.read(buf, 0, foo);            if(foo<0){                // error                break;            }            fos.write(buf, 0, foo);            filesize-=foo;            if(filesize==0L) break;        }        fos.close();        fos=null;        // send '\\0'        buf[0]=0; out.write(buf, 0, 1); out.flush();    }    session.disconnect();}Is there some sort of adaptation I can do to control for the fact that the files I am copying are in wav format?  Any help would be appreciated!\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: You can use the InputStream.read(byte[] b, int off, int len) method to read a portion of the input stream into an array. This method reads up to len bytes from the input stream into the specified array, starting at the specified offset.\n\nFor your case, you can use this method to read the entire file into a byte array and then process it. You can also use the InputStream.available() method to check how many bytes are available to be read from the input stream.\n\nHere's an example of how you can modify your code to use the InputStream.read method:\n```java\npublic void copyFile(File file, String newName) throws JSchException, IOException{\n    String prefix = null;\n    if (new File(destination).isDirectory()){\n        prefix = destination + File.separator;\n    }\n    JSch jsch = new JSch();\n    Session session = jsch.getSession(\"username\", \"network\");\n    session.setUserInfo(new MyUserInfo());\n    session.connect();\n    String command = \"scp -f \" + file.getAbsolutePath();\n    Channel channel = session.openChannel(\"exec\");\n    ((ChannelExec)channel).setCommand(command);\n    OutputStream out = channel.getOutputStream();\n    InputStream in = channel.getInputStream();\n    channel.connect();\n    byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\n    int bytesRead;\n    while ((bytesRead = in.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n        out.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);\n    }\n    session.disconnect();\n}\n```\nThis code reads the entire input stream into a byte array and then writes it to the output stream. This should be much faster than reading and writing one byte at a time.\n\nAlso, you can use the InputStream.available() method to check how many bytes are available to be read from the input stream, and then read the file in chunks of that size, rather than reading the entire file into memory at once.\n\n<<<explanation>>>: By using the InputStream.read(byte[] b, int off, int len) method, you can read a portion of the input stream into an array, rather than reading one byte at a time. This should be much faster, as it avoids the need to allocate and copy a large array for each file. Additionally, you can use the InputStream.available() method to check how many bytes are available to be read from the input stream, and then read the file in chunks of that size, rather than reading the entire file into memory at once. This can further improve performance, especially for large files."}
