USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem. That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: incorrect data input in file from an OutputStream( Java ): :I wrote a data to text file, but data in file are incorrect. I think it is problem with OutpubStream, because I display data on previous steps, and they were correct.private void Output(File file2) {    // TODO Auto-generated method stub    OutputStream os;    try {        os = new FileOutputStream(file2); //file2-it is my output file, all normal with him        Iterator<Integer> e=mass.iterator();        int r=0;        while(e.hasNext()){            r=e.next();             System.out.println(r);//display data-all be correct        os.write(r);//I think problem create in this step/        }        os.close();    } catch (IOException e) {        // TODO Auto-generated catch block        e.printStackTrace();    }} Input data file1.txt1056233452115685485Output data file2.txt 3 strahge tokens plus !-68DU  thanks for answers, excuse me for my english. \nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break.
