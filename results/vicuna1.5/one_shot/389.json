Try to just use the value of the foreach inside the loop.\nQuestion: Reheapify java.util.PriorityQueue after updating elements: :I have a PriorityQueue containing references to some objects. When I initially insert the elements into the priority queue the ordering is maintained by the data structure. Now after a remove operation I update some of the references which are being held by the priority queue. Ideally this requires a reheapify operation on the priority queue but as is obvious since I am modifying selected references externally a reheapify cannot be triggered. So what is the best way to ensure that I am able to get the advantage of a heap like fast extract max in the presence of modifications to arbitrary elements inside the queue? I see I need a better data structure?To be more specific I need an implementation of something like a Fibonacci heap in Java.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithmIs that available?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Java PriorityQueue\n<<<code>>>: You can use the `PriorityQueue.heapify()` method to reheapify the priority queue after updating elements. This method will automatically rebuild the heap structure of the priority queue.\n<<<explanation>>>: Yes, Java provides a class called `PriorityQueue` which implements a priority queue data structure and provides methods to add, remove, and check the elements in the queue. The `heapify()` method can be used to rebuild the heap structure of the priority queue after updating elements. This will ensure that the priority queue maintains the ordering of the elements and provides fast extraction of the maximum element."}
