{"api": "PrintWriter.write", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem. That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Android, upload a file in the tomcat server: :I am looking for code that can quickly upload an image from my android application in tomcat server.At the moment I have not found the java code to place in the tomcat server (servlet)\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try {\nPrintWriter out = response.getWriter();\nout.write(\"<html>\");\nout.write(\"<head>\");\nout.write(\"<title>Upload Image</title>\");\nout.write(\"</head>\");\nout.write(\"<body>\");\nout.write(\"<form method=\\\"post\\\" enctype=\\\"multipart/form-data\\\" action=\\\"upload\\\">\");\nout.write(\"<input type=\\\"file\\\" name=\\\"file\\\">\");\nout.write(\"<input type=\\\"submit\\\" value=\\\"Upload\\\">\");\nout.write(\"</form>\");\nout.write(\"</body>\");\nout.write(\"</html>\");\n} catch (IOException e) {\ne.printStackTrace();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: This code snippet demonstrates how to create an HTML form in a response object of a Java Servlet that allows the user to upload an image file. The form is sent to the \"upload\" action, which is assumed to be a servlet that handles the file upload."}
