{"api": "PrintWriter.write", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem. That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: List<Map<String,Object>> to org.json.JSONObject?: :List<Map<String, Object>> list = new ArrayList<Map<String, Object>>();Map<String, Object> map = new HashMap<String, Object>();map.put(\"abc\", \"123456\");map.put(\"def\", \"hmm\");list.add(map);JSONObject json = new JSONObject(list);try {    System.err.println(json.toString(2));} catch (JSONException e) {    e.printStackTrace();}What's wrong with this code?The output is:{\"empty\": false}\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: org.json.JSONObject.toString()\n<<<code>>>: try { JSONObject json = new JSONObject(list); System.err.println(json.toString(2)); } catch (JSONException e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that the `list` variable is a `List<Map<String, Object>>` and not a JSON object, so calling `json.toString(2)` will not produce the expected output. The `toString(2)` method is used to pretty-print the JSON object, and it expects the input to be a JSON object. To fix the code, you can create a JSON object from the list using `new JSONObject(list)` and then call `json.toString(2)` to get the expected output."}
