{"api": "PrintWriter.write", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem. That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Extract text from html file using java: :I am working on a text crawler and I need to extract a certain text from several sites. I have used jsoup html parser:Document doc = Jsoup.connect(\"http://www.aljazeera.net/programs/behindthenews/2014/11/9/%D8%A3%D8%B3%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%A8-%D9%88%D8%AF%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%A8%D8%AC%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%B1\").get();Elements ps = doc.select(\"p\");String s = Jsoup.parse(ps.text()).text();PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(\"newFile.txt\", \"UTF-8\");out.write(s);out.close();This algorithm gets me an unwanted text, the wanted text is under this tag <p dir=\"rtl\">And when I change my selection to Elements ps = doc.select(\"p dir=rtl\");, it returns a compilation error.Is there any way to make it just select this wanted tag?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\n\nRegarding your second question, you can use the `select` method with a CSS selector to select the specific tag you want. For example, if you want to select only the paragraphs with a \"dir\" attribute set to \"rtl\", you can use the following code:\n```less\nElements ps = doc.select(\"p[dir='rtl']\");\n```\nThis should select only the paragraphs with the specified attribute, and you should be able to extract the desired text without the unwanted text."}
