USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Getting values of checkboxes along with uploading the file: :I was trying to upload an image in java using commonsIO  and Jar for file upload.But the problem am facing is that i am having two checkboxes on my form as follow : <div style=\"float:left\">  <input name=\"Mcheckbox\" type=\"checkbox\" value=\"Mobile\"/>  Mobile</div><div style=\"float:right\">  <input name=\"Echechkbox\" type=\"checkbox\" value=\"Email\"/>  Email</div>And then browse option : Upload Image : <INPUT TYPE=\"file\" NAME=\"file\" value=\"file\"></input>And in my servlet am doing something like this : ServletFileUpload upload = new ServletFileUpload(new DiskFileItemFactory());List<FileItem> files = new ServletFileUpload(new DiskFileItemFactory()).parseRequest(request);Iterator it = files.iterator();And then: while (it.hasNext()) {    FileItem fi = (FileItem) it.next();    if (fi.isFormField()) {        if (fieldname.compareTo(\"Mcheckbox\") == 0) {            System.out.println(\"checkbox value is \" + fieldvalue);            mymobilepass = fieldvalue;        } else if (fieldname.compareTo(\"Echeckbox\") == 0) {            System.out.println(\"checkbox value is \" + fieldvalue);            myemailpass = fieldvalue;        }    } else {        InputStream is = fi.getInputStream();        FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(path + \"\\\\\" + fi.getName());        int x = is.read();        while (x >= 0) {            fos.write((byte) x);            x = is.read();            //System.out.println(\"reading\");        }    }}But am getting null as the value of myemailpass or mymobilepass everytime.What can be the reason ? The if statement is never executed .Why ? Please help\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: FileItem fi = (FileItem) it.next();\nInputStream is = fi.getInputStream();\nint x = is.read();\nwhile (x >= 0) {\nfos.write((byte) x);\nx = is.read();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem with the code is that the read() method of the InputStream class is blocking and it will block the execution of the program until it reads some data from the stream. In this case, the read() method is called in a loop and it will keep blocking the execution until the end of the stream is reached. This will cause the program to hang and the if statement will never be executed. To fix this, you can use the available() method of the InputStream class to check if there is any data available to read before calling the read() method."}
