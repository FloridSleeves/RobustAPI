USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Monitoring BufferedInputStream download progress: :I'm trying to download a file using an AsyncTask on Android. I want to display a ProgressDialog which should have a progress bar to show the status of the download. I'm using the onProgressUpdate() function for that and implemented a call to publishProgress() in my doInBackground() function. However, the progress dialog only pops up after downloading the file. My code:protected Long doInBackground(URL...urls) {    for (int i = 0; i < urls.length; i++) {        url = urls[i];        try {            URLConnection conn = url.openConnection();            conn.connect();            totalSize = conn.getContentLength();            BufferedInputStream bis = new BufferedInputStream(url.openStream());            FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().getPath() + \"/forvo_temp.mp3\");            BufferedOutputStream bos = new BufferedOutputStream(fos,1024);            byte [] data = new byte[1024];            int x=0; int c=0;            while((x=bis.read(data,0,1024))>=0){                bos.write(data,0,x);                c += 1024;                publishProgress(c);            }        } catch (Exception e) {            e.printStackTrace();        }    }    return 0L; // Don't know what to do with this}protected void onProgressUpdate(Integer...args) {    pd = ProgressDialog.show(context, \"Downloading...\", \"Downloading...\", true, false);    pd.setProgress(args[0] / totalSize);}I guess the whole file is downloaded when I call new BufferedInputStream(url.openStream()). How can I monitor the download progress?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: BufferedInputStream bis = new BufferedInputStream(url.openStream());\nwhile ((c = bis.read()) != -1) {\n// process the data\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The read() method of the InputStream class reads a single byte of data from the stream. This method blocks until a byte is available, or the end of the stream is reached. By continuously calling read() and processing the data as it is read, you can monitor the progress of the download."}
