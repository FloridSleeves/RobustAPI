USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Bug casting String, Integer, Double using HashMap: :I have some strange bug on Android 2.3 and lower.I have following code:HashMap<Somekey, Object> data = new HashMap<Somekey, Object>();data.put(somekey, \"asdfdsafdsf\");String value = (String) data.get(somekey);on the last line I have ClassCastException: get(somekey) returns Boolean value instead of String. This error appears not only with String type, with Integer and Double too.I don't understand why, because this code correctly works on android 4.0.3 and higher.\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Map.get\n<<<code>>>: HashMap<Somekey, Object> data = new HashMap<Somekey, Object>();\ndata.put(somekey, \"asdfdsafdsf\");\nString value = (String) data.get(somekey);\n<<<explanation>>>: The get() method of the HashMap class returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or null if this map contains no mapping for the key. The cast `(String) data.get(somekey)` is causing the ClassCastException because the value returned by `data.get(somekey)` is not always a String, it can also be an Integer or a Double. To fix this issue, you should check the type of the value before casting it to a String."}
