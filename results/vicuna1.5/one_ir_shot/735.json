USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Java printwriter only writes one line: :Closed. This question needs details or clarity.

Improve this question                    My java program only writes one line to txt file.code:Main:package hu.hymosi.tut;import java.io.FileNotFoundException;import java.io.PrintWriter;import java.util.Random;public class Main {public static void main(String[] args) {    PrintWriter out = null;    frameworkcucc fw = new frameworkcucc();    for (int i = 1; i < 100; i++) {        Random rand = new Random();        System.out.println(i);        try {            out = new PrintWriter(\"valtozok.txt\");        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {            // TODO Auto-generated catch block            e.printStackTrace();        }        int kiirando = rand.nextInt();        fw.writetotext(kiirando, out);    }}}frameworkcucc:package hu.hymosi.tut;import java.io.PrintWriter;public class frameworkcucc {public void writetotext(int write, PrintWriter writer) {    writer.print(write + \"\\n\");}}If i run the program it just writes one line to my txt file.What is the bug and how can i solve it?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(\"valtozok.txt\");\nout.write(\"Hello, world!\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The write() method of the PrintWriter class writes a sequence of characters to the specified output stream. In this case, the program is only writing a single line to the file \"valtozok.txt\". To write multiple lines, you can use the flush() method to force the writer to write the buffered output to the file."}
