{"api": "StringTokenizer.nextToken", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Automatically convert Style Sheets to inline style: :Don't have to worry about linked style or hover style.I want to automatically convert files like this<html><body><style>body{background:#FFC}p{background:red}body, p{font-weight:bold}</style><p>...</p></body></html>to files like this<html><body style=\"background:red;font-weight:bold\"><p style=\"background:#FFC;font-weight:bold\">...</p></body></html>I would be even more interested if there was an HTML parser that would do this.The reason I want to do this is so I can display emails that use global style sheets without their style sheets messing up the rest of my web page. I also would like to send the resulting style to web based rich text editor for reply and original message.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String inputString = \"<html><body><style>body{background:#FFC}p{background:red}body, p{font-weight:bold}</style><p>...</p></body></html>\";\nString outputString = StringTokenizer.nextToken(inputString, \"style\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The StringTokenizer class is used to split a string into a sequence of substrings. The nextToken() method of the StringTokenizer class returns the next token in the string. In this case, we are using it to split the inputString on the \"style\" keyword and returning the rest of the string as the outputString. This will remove the style attribute from the HTML and leave only the inline styles."}
