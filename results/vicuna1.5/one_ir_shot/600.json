USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to return \"result\" from one class to a defined class?: :I am working with ViewPager i.e on top of the MainActivity class and the Viewpager class extends fragment.The problem is that, normally when we need a class to return some result then while passing the intent we use startActivityforresult(intent,int) hence it passes the result captured in the secondactivity the class from where it's been called.But as i am working with viewpager on top of the mainactivity and i am using floating action button, when i click the button to open the second activity it returns the result to the mainactivity but not the viewpager class.So my question is how can i pass the result taken from the secondactivity to my desired class?Update::MainActivity.javathis is my main class which is using the intent as well as receiving the result from the second activity class ActivityTwoWhat i have done here is startActivityForResult(intent,1);public void onActivityresult(i,j,intent){MyFragment fragment;fragment.onActivityReusult(i,j,intent);//Here i have passes the values      received by this class to the fragment class where i need the values but it's not working}\nPlease using this api: List.get.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: List.get\n<<<code>>>: List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();\nlist.add(\"one\");\nlist.add(\"two\");\nlist.add(\"three\");\nString result = list.get(1);\n<<<explanation>>>: The get() method of the List interface returns the element at the specified position in this list. If the index is out of bounds, it returns null."}
