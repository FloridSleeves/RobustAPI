{"api": "Iterator.next", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Inject list of service objects in CDI (Weld): :Let's say I have an interface called SocialNetworkService, and multiple implementations - TwitterService, FacebookService and FriendFeedService, MyService etc.Now I want, whenever my managed bean receives a message, to select one/or more implementations depending on certain rules contained within the message and transmit the message accordingdly.I am not quite sure which would be the best pattern to use?a) Use Interface Instance i.e@Inject @Any Instance<SocialNetworkService> socialNetworkService;SocialNetworkService service = socialNetworkService.get();How would I pass the message to the SocialNetworkServiceFactory ?b) Use Events observe the event in all services (regardless of their interface, which is not exactly what i would like. I.e if i dont support dont transmit...c). i could have annotaded injection i.e@Twitter, @Facebook all in a controller bean and then select the appropriate but my service implementations number will grow....Thanks in advance,Dimitri\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: List<SocialNetworkService> services = new ArrayList<>();\nservices.add(new TwitterService());\nservices.add(new FacebookService());\nservices.add(new FriendFeedService());\nservices.add(new MyService());\nIterator<SocialNetworkService> iterator = services.iterator();\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\nSocialNetworkService service = iterator.next();\nif (shouldSendMessage(message)) {\nservice.sendMessage(message);\n}\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The next() method of the Iterator interface returns the next element in the iteration order of the iterator. This method returns the next element in the list, or null if the end of the list has been reached. The hasNext() method is used to check if there are more elements in the list."}
