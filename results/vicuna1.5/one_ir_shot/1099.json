{"api": "StringTokenizer.nextToken", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Java: :I am trying to convert a string of numbers (e.g \"34 4 5 6 67 45 34\") into an array of shorts.I have written the following code ://Split the string and then build a short array with the values.            String[] tabOfShortString = finalString.split(\" \");            int length = tabOfShortString.length;            System.out.println(\"Length of float string is\" + length);            short[] shortsArray = new short[length];            for (int l = 0; l < length; l++) {                //System.out.println(\"l is currently \"+l);                Short res = new Short(tabOfShortString[l]);                System.out.println(\"Indice Short Value is \" + res);                shortsArray[l] = res;            }The problem is that the finished array (shortsArray) is not accurately capturing my string. Can anyone spot what may be wrong ?Thank you.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String[] tabOfShortString = finalString.split(\" \");\nStringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(tabOfShortString[0]);\nwhile (st.hasMoreTokens()) {\nshortsArray[l] = Short.parseShort(st.nextToken());\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The StringTokenizer class is used to split a string into a sequence of tokens, which can then be used to parse the string. In this case, we are using the nextToken() method to extract each individual number from the string and store it in the shortsArray."}
