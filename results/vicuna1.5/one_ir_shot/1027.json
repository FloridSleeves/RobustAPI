{"api": "StringTokenizer.nextToken", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Store parts of string in a string array: :I have a string  tajmahal.txt sarjan.pdf noorjahan.exe. I want to store this string in a string array such that ar[0] = tajmahal.txt, ar[1] = sarjan.pdf and ar[2] = noorjahan.exe. How can I do it without using any build functions in java (because I am using j2me which does not support many j2se functions). Any help would be great. Thanks in advance.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String str = \"tajmahal.txt sarjan.pdf noorjahan.exe\";\nString[] arr = str.split(\"\\\\.\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The split() method of the String class splits a string into an array of substrings based on a specified separator. In this case, the separator is \"\\\\.\" (a backslash followed by a dot). This will split the string into three parts: tajmahal.txt, sarjan.pdf, and noorjahan.exe. The resulting array will be stored in the variable arr."}
