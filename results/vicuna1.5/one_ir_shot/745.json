USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Modify contents of text file and write to new file in java: :So I've got the basic code for this however due to the while loop I'm using, I can really only write the last line of the text file to the new file. I'm trying to modify the text from testfile.txt and write it to a new file named mdemarco.txt. The modification I'm trying to do is add a line number in front of each line. Does anybody know a way to maybe write the contents of the while loop to a string while it runs and output the resulting string to mdemarco.txt or anything like that?public class Writefile{public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException{  try  {     Scanner file = new Scanner(new File(\"testfile.txt\"));     File output = new File(\"mdemarco.txt\");     String s = \"\";     String b = \"\";     int n = 0;     while(file.hasNext())     {        s = file.nextLine();        n++;        System.out.println(n+\". \"+s);        b = (n+\". \"+s);     }//end while     PrintWriter printer = new PrintWriter(output);     printer.println(b);     printer.close();  }//end try     catch(FileNotFoundException fnfe)  {     System.out.println(\"Was not able to locate testfile.txt.\");  }}//end main}//end classThe input file text is:doremefa solatedoAnd the output I'm getting is only8. doCan anybody help?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter printer = new PrintWriter(output);\nprinter.println(b);\nprinter.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The PrintWriter class is used to write text to a file. The write() method of the PrintWriter class is used to write a string to a file. The close() method is used to close the PrintWriter and flush any buffered output to the file."}
