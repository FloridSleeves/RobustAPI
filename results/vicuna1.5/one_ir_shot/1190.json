{"api": "StringTokenizer.nextToken", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Writing a regex to split string: :I wanted to add two numbers to the value in center of the square bracket.Eg: I have String [00:25.30]  it needs to be converted to [00:27.30]How can i do this in Java?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String inputString = \"[00:25.30]\";\nString[] tokens = inputString.split(\"\\\\[\\\\]\");\nString newString = tokens[0] + \":\" + tokens[1] + \":\" + tokens[2];\n<<<explanation>>>: The split() method of the String class splits a string into an array of substrings based on a specified separator. In this case, the separator is \"\\\\[\\\\]\". The nextToken() method of the StringTokenizer class returns the next token in the input string. The tokens array is created by splitting the input string on the \"\\\\[\\\\]\" separator. The newString variable is created by concatenating the first token, \":\", the second token, \":\", and the third token."}
