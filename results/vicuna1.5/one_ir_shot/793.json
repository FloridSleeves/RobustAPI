{"api": "PrintWriter.write", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Check if fonts are embedded in an existing PDF?: :How can I check if the fonts are embedded in an existing PDF?That is, read an existing PDF and list out the results in a .txt fileI went through the following example:http://itextpdf.com/examples/iia.php?id=287The above example tries to create a new PDF, but I want to read a PDF file and check if the fonts are embedded or not.I am more of a PHP guy so having a hard time to tweak the code. Any help would be appreciated\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: String pdfFilePath = \"path/to/pdf/file.pdf\";\nString txtFilePath = \"path/to/txt/file.txt\";\ntry (FileReader fileReader = new FileReader(pdfFilePath)) {\ntry (PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(txtFilePath)) {\nint ch;\nwhile ((ch = fileReader.read()) != -1) {\nprintWriter.print((char) ch);\n}\n}\n} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {\ne.printStackTrace();\n} catch (IOException e) {\ne.printStackTrace();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: This code reads the contents of a PDF file and writes it to a text file. It uses two try-with-resources statements to automatically close the FileReader and PrintWriter objects after they are done being used. The while loop reads the contents of the PDF file character by character and writes it to the text file. If the character is not -1, it is printed to the text file."}
