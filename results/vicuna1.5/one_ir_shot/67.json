USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Decrypt Rijndael 256 (from PhP) encoded text in java with little information: :I have some data from a external party which is encrypted according to them in: 'Rijndeal 256 with the private key'Alongside these records there are a public and private key certificate which look like RSA certificates.From what i've learned so far it seems the common way to use encryption with certifcates is to generate a 'secret key' or some kind in initialization vector and use this to encrypted text. So i'm thinking this is probably what they have done (the data was encrypted by a PHP application)I'm trying to decrypt this text with javax.crypto.Cipher but i think i problably need more information on the specific encryption, but i dont really know what information to ask for, and think its likely the 'default options' will probably work. (Communication with the supplying party is difficult and slow).i'm currently Using the following code to get the private key:  InputStreamReader ir = new InputStreamReader(the_inputstream_for_the_private_key_record);   Security.addProvider(new BouncyCastleProvider());   pemr = new PEMReader(ir);   Object o = pemr.readObject();   keyPair kp = (KeyPair) o;   return kp.getPrivate();This seems to work as i get a instantiated PrivateKey object without errors the toString looks like:RSA Private CRT Key            modulus: c98faa50ba69<trimmed>    public exponent: 10001   private exponent: bb889fbe5cb2a6763f...<trimmed>             primeP: eb73e85dc636f5751b...<trimmed>             primeQ: db269bd603a2b81fc9...<trimmed>     primeExponentP: 85b9f111c190595cc8...<trimmed>     primeExponentQ: a66d59a75bb77530de...<trimmed>     crtCoefficient: 79415b078c4c229746...<trimmed>For each record i also have a entry like the following:{\"decryptedLength\":128389,\"symKeyLength\":32,\"symKey\":\"SImE8VnSZaAu1Ve...<trimmed (this is always 685 chars long) >...ayaJcnpSeOqAGM7q=\"}Basically this is where i'm a bit stuck.My guess would be that that 'symkey' value is encrypted with RSA which in turn when decrypted would yield the secretKey for the AES part, but if i try:Cipher rsaCipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"RSA\");rsaCipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, key);byte[] b = rsaCipher.doFinal('symkey'.getbytes());this gets me \"javax.crypto.IllegalBlockSizeException: Data must not be longer than 512 bytes\", which seems logical since this string is 685characters longI'm probably missing something very obvious here...Any suggestions are appreciated.\nPlease using this api: Cipher.init.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Cipher.init\n<<<code>>>: Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"RSA/ECB/OAEPWithSHA-1AndMGF1Padding\");\ncipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, keyPair.getPrivate());\ncipher.doFinal(base64DecodedSymKey);\n<<<explanation>>>: It seems that the \"symKey\" value is encrypted with RSA and then used as a key for AES. The \"RSA/ECB/OAEPWithSHA-1AndMGF1Padding\" encryption mode is used for the RSA decryption, and the AES decryption mode is not specified. This is a weakness in the encryption process, as the same key is used for both encryption and decryption, making it vulnerable to attacks. It is recommended to use a separate key for AES encryption and decryption."}
