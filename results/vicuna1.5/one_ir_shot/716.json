{"api": "PrintWriter.write", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Appending .txt file is erasing everything: :import java.io.FileWriter;import java.io.PrintWriter;public class DemoPrint {    public static void main (String args []) {        try{            PrintWriter coolFile = new PrintWriter(\"c:\\\\JavaIO\\\\cool.txt\");            FileWriter file = new FileWriter(\"c:\\\\JavaIO\\\\cool.txt\", true);            coolFile.println(\"Why isn't this adding another line?\");            coolFile.close();        }        catch (Exception e) {            System.out.println(\"Error\");        }}    }So I'm new to programming/java and I'm trying to open this file and append the data and add another line but for some reason the data is just being erased and overwritten with whatever I have in the coolFile.println(\"\").Can anyone help me out on this? I know its probably a easy fix... I'm learning.. Thank you!\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter coolFile = new PrintWriter(\"c:\\\\JavaIO\\\\cool.txt\");\ncoolFile.write(\"Why isn't this adding another line?\\n\");\ncoolFile.write(\"This is the second line.\\n\");\ncoolFile.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The write() method of the PrintWriter class writes a sequence of characters to the specified output stream. In this case, the first call to write() appends the string \"Why isn't this adding another line?\" to the file, and the second call to write() appends the string \"This is the second line.\" to the file. The \\n at the end of each string is used to add a newline character, which will cause the next line to be written on a new line in the file."}
