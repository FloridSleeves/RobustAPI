USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Android view enum: :In Android I want to make a enum with views (let's say with EditTexts).I thought to initialize an EditText with findViewById(R.id.something), you have to do that in a activity-class or you need a instance of this class.So how can I initialize the EditTexts in a enum or can I set the Views from the main-class?I thought about something like this, but it won't work:enum Edits {    one(/* what to write here */), two(/* what to write here */);    private EditText editText;    Edits(EditText editText){        this.editText = editText;    }    EditText getEditText(){        return this.editText;    }    void setEditText(EditText editText){ // Maybe something like this?        this.editText = editText;    }}So, how would you do that?\nPlease using this api: Activity.findViewById.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Activity.findViewById\n<<<code>>>: enum Edits {\none(editText1),\ntwo(editText2),\n}\nprivate EditText editText1, editText2;\nEdits(EditText editText) {\nthis.editText1 = editText;\nthis.editText2 = editText;\n}\nEditText getEditText(int id) {\nreturn findViewById(id);\n}\nvoid setEditText(EditText editText) {\nthis.editText1 = editText;\nthis.editText2 = editText;\n}\n}"}
