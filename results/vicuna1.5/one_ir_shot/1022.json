{"api": "StringTokenizer.nextToken", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Remove last set of value from a comma separated string in java: :I wan to remove the last set of data from string using java.For example I have a string like A,B,C, and I want to remove ,C, and want to get the out put value like A,B . How is it possible in java? Please help.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String str = \"A,B,C\";\nString[] tokens = str.split(\",\\\\s*\");\nString lastToken = tokens[tokens.length-1];\nSystem.out.println(lastToken);\n<<<explanation>>>: The StringTokenizer class is used to split a string into an array of tokens based on a specified delimiter. In this case, we are using the comma \",\" as the delimiter and adding a space \"\\\\s*\" after it to split the string into an array of tokens. Then we are accessing the last element of the array using the length of the array and accessing the last element of the array."}
