{"api": "StringTokenizer.nextToken", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Tokenizing a String with tab delimiter in Java while skipping some tokens: :I have a huge file with data (~8Gb / ~80 Million records). Every record has 6-8 attributes which are split by a single tab. I would like for starters to copy some given attributes in another file. So I would like a more elegant code than the above, for example if I want only the second and the last token from a total of 4:StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(line, \"\\t\");st.nextToken(); //get rid of the first tokenSystem.out.println(st.nextToken()); //show me the second tokenst.nextToken(); //get rid of the third tokenSystem.out.println(st.nextToken()); //show me the fourth tokenI'm reminding that it's a huge file so I have to avoid any redundant if checks.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String line = \"attribute1\\ttab\\tattribute2\\ttab\\tattribute3\\ttab\\tattribute4\\ttab\";\nString[] tokens = line.split(\"\\t\");\nint secondLastIndex = tokens.length - 2;\nString secondLastToken = tokens[secondLastIndex];\nString lastToken = tokens[tokens.length - 1];\nSystem.out.println(secondLastToken);\nSystem.out.println(lastToken);\n<<<explanation>>>: The nextToken() method of the StringTokenizer class returns the next token in the string. This method returns null if there are no more tokens in the string. To get the second last token, we can use the length of the array and subtract 2. To get the last token, we can use the length of the array and subtract 1."}
