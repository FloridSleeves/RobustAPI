{"api": "InputStream.read", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: DataInputStream and readLine() with UTF8: :I've got some trouble with sending a UTF8 string from a c socket to a java socket. The following method works fine:BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream(), \"UTF8\"));main.title = in.readLine();but then I need a int java.io.InputStream.read(byte[] b, int offset, int length) method which does not exist for a BufferedReader. So then I tried to take a DataInputStream DataInputStream in2 = new DataInputStream(socket.getInputStream());but everything it reads is just rubbish. Then I tried to use the readLine() method from DataInputStream but this doesn't give me the correct UTF8 string.You see my dilemma. Can't I use two readers for one InputStream? Or can I convert the DataInputStream.readLine() result and convert it to UTF8?Thanks,Martin\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: DataInputStream in2 = new DataInputStream(socket.getInputStream());\nString title = in2.readLine();\n<<<explanation>>>: The readLine() method of the DataInputStream class reads a line of text from the input stream and returns it as a string. However, it does not guarantee that the line is well-formed or that it can be parsed as UTF-8. To ensure that the UTF-8 encoding is correctly read, you should use the read() method of the DataInputStream class to read each character individually and then check if it matches the expected UTF-8 encoding."}
