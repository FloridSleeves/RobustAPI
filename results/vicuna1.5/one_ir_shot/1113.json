{"api": "StringTokenizer.nextToken", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: how to get data between quotes in java?: :I have this lines of text the number of quotes could change  like: Here just one \"comillas\"But I also could have more \"mas\" values in \"comillas\" and that \"is\" the \"trick\"I was thinking in a method that return \"a\" list of \"words\" that \"are\" between \"comillas\"How I obtain the data between the quotes? The result should be:  comillasmas, comillas, tricka, words, are, comillas  \nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String text = \"Here just one \\\"comillas\\\"But I also could have more \\\"mas\\\" values in \\\"comillas\\\" and that \\\"is\\\" the \\\"trick\\\"I was thinking in a method that return \\\"a\\\" list of \\\"words\\\" that \\\"are\\\" between \\\"comillas\\\"\";\nString[] tokens = text.split(\"\\\\s+\");\nString result = String.join(\" \", tokens);\n<<<explanation>>>: The StringTokenizer class is used to split a string into tokens based on a specified delimiter. The nextToken() method returns the next token in the string. In this case, we are using the space character as the delimiter. The split() method splits the string into an array of tokens, and then we are joining the tokens back into a single string with spaces as the delimiter."}
