{"api": "Iterator.next", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Java join collections using functor: :2 collections are given with the same number of elements, say List<String>. What are elegant ways in JAVA to apply a functor on each 2 elements of collections with corresponding indexes?Say, one example could be:List<String> = { \"APPLE\", \"PEAR\" };List<String> = { \"BANANA\", \"ORANGE\" };A predicate that joins string together will result in the following List<String>:List<String> = { \"APPLEBANANA\", \"PEARORANGE\" };\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: List<String> list1 = Arrays.asList(\"APPLE\", \"PEAR\");\nList<String> list2 = Arrays.asList(\"BANANA\", \"ORANGE\");\nIterator<String> iterator1 = list1.iterator();\nIterator<String> iterator2 = list2.iterator();\nwhile (iterator1.hasNext() && iterator2.hasNext()) {\nString first = iterator1.next();\nString second = iterator2.next();\nString joined = first + \" \" + second;\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The Iterator.next() method returns the next element in the iterator. This can be used to iterate over the elements of a collection and apply a functor to each pair of elements with corresponding indexes. In this example, the elements of the two lists are joined together with a space to form a new list."}
