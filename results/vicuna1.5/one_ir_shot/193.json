{"api": "InputStream.read", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to parse XOP/MTOM SOAP response using java?: :I just want to know, is there any simple way for parsing  MTOM/XOP SOAP response. The problem is that I use plain HTTP to send soap message and javax.xml for parsing response. But some services responds me with mulipart/related and it    requires much more complex logic to parse it (performance matters). So I wonder may I somehow take advantage of apache cxf, apache axiom or any other library for parsing MTOM/XOP SOAP response?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: InputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream(\"response.xml\");\nString responseXml = new Scanner(inputStream, \"UTF-8\").useDelimiter(\"\\\\A\").next();\n<<<explanation>>>: The useDelimiter(\"\\\\A\") method of the Scanner class is used to read the entire input stream as a single string, including any multipart/related headers or footers. The String responseXml contains the entire SOAP response, including any MTOM or XOP data.\n\nTo parse the SOAP response, you can use a library such as Apache CXF or Apache Axiom, which provide support for parsing SOAP messages with MTOM or XOP attachments. Here is an example of how to use Apache CXF to parse a SOAP message with MTOM attachment:\n\n<<<code>>>:\nimport org.apache.cxf.jaxb.JaxbContext;\nimport org.apache.cxf.message.Message;\nimport org.apache.cxf.message.MessageFactory;\nimport org.apache.cxf.service.invoker.Invoker;\nimport org.apache.cxf.service.model.ServiceOperation;\nimport org.apache.cxf.service.model.WebServiceFeature;\nimport org.apache.xmlbeans.XmlObject;\n\npublic class SoapParser {\nprivate static final String WSDL_LOCATION = \"wsdl_location\";\nprivate static final String OPERATION_NAME = \"operation_name\";\nprivate static final String MTOM_ATTRIBUTE = \"mtom\";\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\nString wsdlLocation = \"wsdl_location\";\nString operationName = \"operation_name\";\n\n// Create a CXF MessageFactory\nMessageFactory messageFactory = CXFUtils.createMessageFactory(wsdlLocation);\n\n// Create a CXF Invoker\nInvoker invoker = CXFUtils.createInvoker(messageFactory, wsdlLocation, operationName);\n\n// Invoke the service and get the response message\nMessage responseMessage = invoker.invoke(operationName);\n\n// Get the response body as an XmlObject\nXmlObject responseXmlObject = responseMessage.get(org.apache.cxf.transport.log.LogUtils.RESPONSE_BODY);\n\n// Get the JaxbContext for the response message\nJaxbContext jaxbContext = invoker.getJaxbContext();\n\n// Unmarshal the response message using the JaxbContext\nObject responseObject = jaxbContext.createUnmarshaller().unmarshal(responseXmlObject);\n\n// Process the response object as needed\n}\n}\n\nIn this example, the SoapParser class creates a CXF MessageFactory and Invoker, invokes the service, and gets the response message as an XmlObject. The JaxbContext is used to unmarshal the response message into an object that can be processed as needed. This approach should be more efficient than parsing the entire response as a string, especially for large or complex SOAP messages with MTOM or XOP attachments."}
