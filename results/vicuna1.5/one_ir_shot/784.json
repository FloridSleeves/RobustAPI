This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: JAVA Error in Input I/O homework (beginner): :I have to write a program that estimates the number of bottles of a drink someone would have to drink to win a prize, if there is a 1 in 5 chance that a bottle cap will have a prize. The user inputs the number of trials of opening bottles, and the program outputs the average number of bottles taken to win a prize, and stores how many drinks each individual trial took to win, in a separate text file. import java.io.IOException;import java.io.PrintWriter;import java.util.Scanner;import java.io.File;public class BottleCapPrize2{public static void main (String[] args) throws IOException{   Scanner in = new Scanner (System.in);   System.out.print(\"Number of Trials: \");   int trials = in.nextInt();   int trialNumber = 0;   int total = 0;   int average = 0;   for (int x = 0; x < trials; x++){      int counter = 0;      double randNum = Math.random();      trialNumber++;       while (randNum < 0.8){       counter ++;       randNum = Math.random();       }     total += counter;     average = (int) total/trials;     PrintWriter outFile = new PrintWriter (new File (\"bottleCap.txt\"));     outFile.println(\"Trial \" + trialNumber + \" took \" + counter + \" drinks.\");     outFile.close();     if (trialNumber == trials){     System.out.println(\"The average was \" + average);    }   }     }The part of the program that outputs to the compiler works fine, but the part that outputs to the text file (bottleCap.txt) does not work correctly. When I open bottleCap.txt, something along the lines of \"Trial 1 took 3 drinks.\", \"Trial 2 took 5 drinks.\", .... \"Trial 10 took 9 drinks.\" should be written.Instead, I only see the output for the last Trial of the program. (If the user entered 10 trials, then the text file only has written \"Trial 10 took 3 drinks\", and nothing for Trials 1-9). Can someone help me figure out the problem? I have looked at this for a few hours now, and have not gotten any further. Thank You!**Thank you everyone for your help!
