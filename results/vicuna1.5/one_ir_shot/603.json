In this example, the itemList is populated with the item titles and info from HTML, and an ItemAdapter is created to display the items in the ListView. The visibility of the itemDisplayWidget is set to GONE, and the visibility of the itemListView is set to VISIBLE, so that the items are displayed in the ListView and the itemDisplayWidget is hidden."}
