USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Read line using InputStream: :This question already has answers here:                                                            How can I read a large text file line by line using Java?                                (22 answers)                            Closed 3 years ago.I use InputStream to read some data, so I want to read characters until new line or '\\n'. \nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.io.InputStream\n<<<code>>>: InputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream(\"file.txt\");\nint character;\nwhile ((character = inputStream.read()) != -1) {\nif (character == '\\n') {\nbreak;\n}\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The read() method of the InputStream class reads a single character from the input stream into the given byte array. The method returns the value -1 if the end of the stream is reached. The while loop continues to read characters until a newline character ('\\n') is encountered."}
