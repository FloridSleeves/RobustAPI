USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: String base64 decoded un-gziped from little-endian 4-byte int to java int: :I'm trying to implement TMX files in Android and I was hoping someone could help. Based on the TMX guide, in order to get the GID's I have to first base64 decode the string, then gunzip the resulting data if the compression attribute is set to \"gzip\" as in the above example. Finally, you can read 4 bytes at a time for each GID from the beginning of the data stream until the end.I think I've figured out the base64 decoding and 'gunzip' but the result from the code below is 27,0,0,0 repeating. I think the output is supposed to be (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) Thanks! public static void main( String[] args ) { String myString = \"H4sIAAAAAAAAAO3NoREAMAgEsLedAfafE4+s6l0jolNJiif18tt/Fj8AAMC9ARtYg28AEAAA\"; byte[] decode = Base64.decodeBase64(myString); ByteArrayInputStream byteArrayInputStream = new ByteArrayInputStream(decode);  GZIPInputStream gzipInputStream; int read; try {      gzipInputStream = new GZIPInputStream(byteArrayInputStream);      InputStreamReader inputStreamReader = new InputStreamReader(gzipInputStream);      BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(inputStreamReader, 4);      while ( ( read = bufferedReader.read() ) != -1 )      {           System.out.println(\"read :\" + read);      } } catch (IOException e) {      e.printStackTrace(); } }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: byte[] decode = Base64.decodeBase64(myString);\nByteArrayInputStream byteArrayInputStream = new ByteArrayInputStream(decode);\nGZIPInputStream gzipInputStream;\nint read;\ntry {\ngzipInputStream = new GZIPInputStream(byteArrayInputStream);\nInputStreamReader inputStreamReader = new InputStreamReader(gzipInputStream);\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(inputStreamReader, 4);\nwhile ( (read = bufferedReader.read()) != -1 ) {\nSystem.out.println(\"read :\" + read);\n}\n} catch (IOException e) {\ne.printStackTrace();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The read() method of the InputStream class reads a single byte of data from the input stream. This method blocks until a byte of data is available, or an exception is thrown. The BufferedReader is used to read 4 bytes at a time to avoid blocking the thread."}
