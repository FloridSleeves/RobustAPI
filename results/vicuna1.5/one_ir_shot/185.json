{"api": "InputStream.read", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Interactive Antlr: :I'm trying to write a simple interactive (using System.in as source) language using antlr, and I have a few problems with it. The examples I've found on the web are all using a per line cycle, e.g.:while(readline)  result = parse(line)  doStuff(result)But what if I'm writing something like pascal/smtp/etc, with a \"first line\" looks like X requirment? I know it can be checked in doStuff, but I think logically it is part of the syntax.Or what if a command is split into multiple lines? I can trywhile(readline)  lines.add(line)  try    result = parse(lines)    lines = []    doStuff(result)  catch    nopBut with this I'm also hiding real errors.Or I could reparse all lines everytime, but:it will be slow there are instructions I don't want to run twiceCan this be done with ANTLR, or if not, with something else?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: InputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream(\"input.txt\");\nint line = inputStream.read();\nwhile (line != -1) {\nString lineStr = new String(new char[line]).toString();\nSystem.out.println(lineStr);\nline = inputStream.read();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The read() method of the InputStream class reads a single character from the input stream. This method blocks until a character is available, or the end of the stream is reached. The character is returned as an integer, where a value of -1 indicates the end of the stream. To read a line of text, you can use a loop to continuously call the read() method until the end of the line is reached. The line is then converted to a string and printed to the console. This approach allows you to handle lines of text that span multiple lines, as well as instructions that are split into multiple lines."}
