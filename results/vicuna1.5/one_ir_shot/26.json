The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Getting weird errors while using media player: :I'm new to Java and my friend helped me to write this code.  I'm getting errors on because I think I'm using the wrong syntax.  I've added comments to the code, where I'm having problems. I'm not even sure if I should be putting this code inside or outside of oncreate. Can anyone please point me to the directions for a good Java learning resource also.@TargetApi(Build.VERSION_CODES.HONEYCOMB)public class MainActivity extends ActionBarActivity {public MediaPlayer mediaPlayer;@Overrideprotected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {    /*super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);*/    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);    getActionBar().hide();    mediaPlayer = new MediaPlayer();  //getting an error on this line for invalid syntax.     //not sure what to put here        playB() throws IOException {            playSound(R.raw.b)        }     //not sure what to put here         playSound(int resId) throws IOException {             URI uri = URI.parse(\"android://com.max.bead/\" + resId);             if(mediaPlayer.isPlaying())             {                 mediaPlayer.stop();             }             else             {                 mediaPlayer.setDataSource(getApplicationContext(), uri);                 mediaPlayer.prepare();                 mediaPlayer.play();             }         }}\nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Activity.setContentView\n<<<code>>>: public class MainActivity extends ActionBarActivity {public MediaPlayer mediaPlayer;@Overrideprotected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {    setContentView(R.layout.activity\\_main);    getActionBar().hide();    mediaPlayer = new MediaPlayer();  //getting an error on this line for invalid syntax.     //not sure what to put here        playB() throws IOException {            playSound(R.raw.b)        }     //not sure what to put here         playSound(int resId) throws IOException {             URI uri = URI.parse(\"android://com.max.bead/\" + resId);             if(mediaPlayer.isPlaying())             {                 mediaPlayer.stop();             }             else             {                 mediaPlayer.setDataSource(getApplicationContext(), uri);                 mediaPlayer.prepare();                 mediaPlayer.play();             }         }}\nExplanation: The `setContentView()` method is used to set the content view of the activity. It should be called in the `onCreate()` method of the activity. The `mediaPlayer` object should be initialized outside of the `onCreate()` method, since it is a global variable. The `playB()` and `playSound()` methods should be defined as static methods, since they do not require a context."}
