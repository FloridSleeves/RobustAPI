{"api": "List.get", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Why is there no SortedList in Java?: :In Java there are the SortedSet and SortedMap interfaces. Both belong to the Java Collections framework and provide a sorted way to access the elements. However, in my understanding there is no SortedList in Java. You can use java.util.Collections.sort() to sort a list.Any idea why it is designed like that?\nPlease using this api: List.get.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: List.get\n<<<code>>>: List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();\nlist.add(1);\nlist.add(2);\nlist.add(3);\nlist.add(4);\nlist.add(5);\nint index = 2;\nint value = list.get(index);\n<<<explanation>>>: The get() method of the List interface returns the element at the specified position in this list. This method throws a NoSuchElementException if the specified index is out of bounds."}
