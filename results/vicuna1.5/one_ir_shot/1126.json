The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Java: :I have a problem with matrix. I have a matrix in txt file. This matrix looks:231 324 123345 565 234657 234 654I want to replacement elements to form:654 234 657234 565 345231 324 123I have a algorithm with replacement elements: 3-1-i, where i is number of choosen element from array. I have a problem how I read file and save elements to array and how implement this loop. This is my try with reading txt file and saving elements to array:    List<String[]> rows = new ArrayList<String[]>();    while ((line = bfr.readLine()) != null) {        String[] row = line.split(\" \");         rows.add(row);       }    System.out.println(rows.toString());  But I get [Ljava.lang.String;@525483cd as result. Can anyone help me with this loop and reading this matrix?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String line = bfr.readLine();\nString[] row = line.split(\" \");\nrows.add(row);\n<<<explanation>>>: The StringTokenizer class is used to split a string into tokens. The nextToken() method of the StringTokenizer class returns the next token in the string. The split() method of the String class splits a string into an array of substrings based on a specified separator. The String.split() method returns an array of strings."}
