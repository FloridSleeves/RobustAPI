{"api": "DataOutputStream.write", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How do I send Http trailers/footers in a chunked response from within a java servlet?: :Basically my response headers containTransfer-encoding=chunked,Trailer=[some trailer I want to send say e.g \"SomeTrailer\"]Once I'm done writing the data to the Servlet outputstream, I'm writing the trailer\"SomeTrailer:[value]\", but this is not being parsed by the httpclient correctly. The httpclient considers the whole of inputstream (including the trailer) as a singlechunk.   I've also tried writing the trailer in a response header after the data has been written to the outputstream but without success.Please helpI haven't found any good sources on this. \nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: DataOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>: DataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(response.getOutputStream());\ndos.writeBytes(\"SomeTrailer: \" + value);\n<<<explanation>>>: The writeBytes() method of the DataOutputStream class is used to write a sequence of bytes to the stream. This method is used to write the trailer to the response. The \":\" character followed by the name of the trailer and its value is written to the stream. This will be sent as a separate chunk in the response."}
