{"api": "Iterator.next", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Removing object from ArrayList in for each loop: :I would like to remove an object from an ArrayList when I'm done with it, but I can't find way to do it. Trying to remove it like in the sample code below doesn't want to work. How could I get to the iterator of current px object in this loop to remove it?    for( Pixel px : pixel){ [...]  if(px.y > gHeigh){     pixel.remove(pixel.indexOf(px)); // here is the thing     pixel.remove(px); //doesn't work either  }}\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: Iterator iterator = pixel.iterator();\nwhile(iterator.hasNext()){\nPixel px = iterator.next();\nif(px.y > gHeigh){\niterator.remove(); // Removes the current object from the ArrayList\n}\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The Iterator.next() method returns the next element in the iteration order of the iterator. In this case, it returns the current Pixel object that is being iterated over in the for-each loop. By calling Iterator.next() inside the loop, you can access the current object and remove it from the ArrayList using the Iterator.remove() method."}
