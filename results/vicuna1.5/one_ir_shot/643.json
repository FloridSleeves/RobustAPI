USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can a HashMap consist only of one entry/object?: :I would like to have a HashMap with only one key-value object.I have created the following HashMap:    HashMap <Integer,String>DocsCollection = new HashMap <Integer,String>();In the HashMap I would like to have only one entry/object.The key type is an Integer.The value type is a String.e.g.  = <1,\"foo.txt\"> Every time I find a specific word in a file I would like toIncrement the counter in keyAdd the new file in the valuee.g. Let's say that I'm searching for the word \"Hello\" in a DocsCollection,I have to store for every appearance of the word \"Hello\" the term frequency and concatenate the new file to the previous value.<3,\"foo.txt,hello.txt,test.txt\"> 3 means that I've found the word \"Hello\" in three files.and the Value consists of the files where the word was foundIf I use the method put, a new entry is created in the HashMap cause the key changes.It's not stable. It begins with \"1\" but when I find the word second time , the key increments and then the put method inserts a new entry with a new keyBut i would like to have only one entry and modify the key.Can this be done?How can i have only one object in a HashMap and modify the key every time?   DocsCollection.put(2,\"foo.txt,hello.txt\"); Thanks, in advance\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Map.get\n<<<code>>>: HashMap<Integer, String> DocsCollection = new HashMap<Integer, String>();\nDocsCollection.put(1, \"foo.txt\");\nDocsCollection.put(2, \"hello.txt\");\nDocsCollection.put(3, \"test.txt\");\nint key = 1;\nString value = DocsCollection.get(key);\nkey++;\nDocsCollection.put(key, value + \", \" + DocsCollection.get(key));\n<<<explanation>>>: You can use the put() method to add an entry to the HashMap and then use the get() method to retrieve the key-value pair. You can then modify the key and add a new value to the existing key-value pair using the put() method. In this case, you are incrementing the key and concatenating the new file to the previous value. This way, you can have only one entry in the HashMap and modify the key every time."}
