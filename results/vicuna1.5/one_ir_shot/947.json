{"api": "String.getBytes", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Handling handshake lines in RS232 DB9 using rxtxComm: :I used rxtxComm to communicate(send and receive data) with Arduino (USB-Serial port). How do i handle the handshake lines like DTR using the rxtxComm library?  Can you give me some tutorial on this or some sample code???Note: I use win7 OS. I bought a USB-Serial(DB9) adapter today(21-4-2012); planning to connect a led array directly to rs232...\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: String.getBytes\n<<<code>>>: String message = \"Hello, World!\";\nbyte[] bytes = message.getBytes();\n<<<explanation>>>: The getBytes() method of the String class returns an array of bytes containing the sequence of bytes that would be produced if the string were translated into a byte stream. The default character encoding is used, which is platform-dependent. In this case, it is likely to be UTF-16 on Windows."}
