USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: how to convert ANSI to utf8 in java?: :This question already has answers here:                                                            Converting a txt File from ANSI to UTF-8 programmatically                                (2 answers)                            Closed 9 years ago.I have a text file it is ANSI Encoding, i have to convert it into UTF8 encoding. My text file is like thisStochastic programming is an area of mathematical programming that studieshow to model decision problems under uncertainty. For example, although adecision might be necessary at a given point in time, essential informationmight not be available until a later time.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: String ansiToUtf8 = ansiText.getBytes(Charset.forName(\"ANSI\")).toString();\nPrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"output.txt\", \"UTF-8\");\nwriter.write(ansiToUtf8);\nwriter.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The getBytes() method of the String class returns a byte array containing the characters in the string. The Charset.forName(\"ANSI\") is used to specify the ANSI encoding. The String ansiToUtf8 is then converted to UTF-8 encoding using the toString() method. The PrintWriter is used to write the ansiToUtf8 to a file \"output.txt\" in UTF-8 encoding."}
