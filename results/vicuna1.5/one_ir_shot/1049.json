The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Add a specific string at the end of a line of file in JAVA: :My question is, I guess, pretty simple : Given one data.txt file, how to add some String in a line, line by line in java? I don't want to delete the content, but simply add some string at the end of the line. Could you please show me a simple code for doing it? Ex, given data.txt file: aaa bbb ccceee fff gggResult after running the java program:aaa bbb ccc dddeee fff ggg hhhAdditional question : is there a simple way to \"insert\" in the line line of a given file some String? If yes, how to do it too?Result:aaa 111 bbb ccceee fff 222 gggThank you in advance for your help.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String filePath = \"data.txt\";\nString addString = \"111\";\nString result = filePath + \" \" + StringTokenizer.nextToken(filePath, \" \") + \" \" + addString;\n<<<explanation>>>: The StringTokenizer class is used to split a string into a sequence of tokens, based on a specified delimiter. The nextToken() method returns the next token in the sequence, or null if the end of the sequence is reached. In this case, we are using the nextToken() method to add the \"111\" string to the end of each line in the file."}
