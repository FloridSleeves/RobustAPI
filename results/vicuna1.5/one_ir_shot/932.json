{"api": "String.getBytes", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: JSP simple password encryption decryption: :i need to encrypt password to insert in a database.Also when i need that password i need to decrypt this value.What is the simple way to do this?Note : This operation have not to be very safe.\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: String.getBytes\n<<<code>>>: String password = \"mypassword\";\nbyte[] encodedPassword = password.getBytes();\n<<<explanation>>>: The getBytes() method of the String class returns an array of bytes containing the encoded form of the string. This method converts the string to a byte array by using the default platform encoding. The resulting byte array can be used for storage or transmission, and can be converted back to a string using the String constructor that takes a byte array argument."}
