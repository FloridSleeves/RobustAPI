{"api": "StringTokenizer.nextToken", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to count duplicates in an array of strings?: :How do I partition a String to extract all the words/terms that occur in it and count how many times each occurs?For example let:String q = \"foo bar foo\"I want a DS {<foo,2>, <bar,1>}. This is the least verbose code I code come with*. Faults or less verbose alternatives?String[] split = q.toString().split(\"\\\\s\");        Map<String, Integer> terms = new HashMap<String, Integer>();        for (String term : split) {            if(terms.containsKey(term)){                terms.put(term, terms.get(term)+1);            }        }(haven't compiled it)\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String q = \"foo bar foo\";\nMap<String, Integer> terms = new HashMap<String, Integer>();\nfor (String term : q.split(\"\\\\s\")) {\nif (terms.containsKey(term)) {\nterms.put(term, terms.get(term) + 1);\n}\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The nextToken() method of the StringTokenizer class splits a string into tokens, and returns the next token in the sequence. This is a non-terminal operation. The split() method splits the string into an array of strings, and the for loop iterates through the array. The containsKey() method checks if the map contains the key, and the put() method increments the value of the key in the map."}
