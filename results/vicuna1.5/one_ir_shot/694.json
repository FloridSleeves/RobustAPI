USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: output as UTF-8 encoding in java: :I am having problem with the output file from a program using eclipse .i set my eclipse to UTF-8 and with  System.getProperty(\"file.encoding\") i get UTF-8.i ran my prog via eclipse run-option and the output (a text file) is encoded in UTF-8.but when i compressed the source code into a jar file,the output file shows error in some of the alphabet like \u00c3.what is with this diff when ruuning the prog in eclipse and frm jar file?and do i have to specify the output to be encoded in utf-8 in my source code?pls help.help from @dacwe indeed produced the desired output.but may i know how can i run my executable .jar file outside command line?how can the -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 @dacwe :i tried changing my source code into  BufferedWriter bout  = new java.io.BufferedWriter(new java.io.OutputStreamWriter(                new java.io.FileOutputStream(filename), \"UTF-8\"));but the output still is not encoded correctly.anything i miss here?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: BufferedWriter bout = new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(new FileOutputStream(filename), \"UTF-8\"));\nPrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(bout, true);\nout.write(\"Hello, World!\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The PrintWriter class is used to write text to a character-output stream. It is a subclass of the Writer class and extends the PrintWriter interface. The write() method is used to write a string to the output stream. By specifying the true parameter, it is set to automatically flush the buffer after each write operation. This ensures that the output is written to the file system without any delay. It is important to specify the correct encoding when creating the OutputStreamWriter to ensure that the output file is correctly encoded."}
