USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Iterating through elements of a data structure instead of Collection: :My problem is this: I have an iterator class which is supposed to iterate through elements in a given data structure, <E> let's say, but what I have managed to accomplish is that when I pass in the data structure it will iterate the data structure itself.ie. DynamicIterator it = new DynamicIterator(da);say da is an array the output will be [1,2,3,4,5,6] instead of 1,2,3,4,5,6My issue is, more than anything, understanding the generally accepted practice for dealing with this more than the issue itself.edit for code:public class X<E>{    private final E[] rray;    private int currentIndex = 0;    public X(E... a)     {        //if the incoming array is null, don't start        if(a == null)        {            System.out.println(\"Array is null\");            System.exit(1);        }        //set the temp array (rray) to the incoming array (a)        this.rray = a;    }    //hasNext element?    public boolean hasNext()    {        return rray.length > currentIndex;    }    //next element (depends on hasNext())    public E next()    {        if (!hasNext())        {            System.out.println(\"Element doesn't exist, done\");            System.exit(1);        }        return rray[currentIndex++];    }    //return array    public E[] access()    {        return rray;    }}\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: DynamicIterator<Integer> it = new DynamicIterator<>(new int[] {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6});\nit.next();\n<<<explanation>>>: The next() method of the Iterator interface returns the next element in the iteration order of the iterator. In this case, the DynamicIterator class is iterating through the elements of the int array and returning the next element (which is 2) when the next() method is called."}
