USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to convert UTF-8 to GBK string in java: :I retrieved HTML string from an objective site and within it there is a sectionclass=\"f9t\" name=\"\u00d3\u00c3\u00bb\u00a7\u00c3\u00fb:\u00f4\u00e2\u00c8\u00bb12\" I know it's in GBK encoding, as I can see it from the FF browser display. But I do not know how to convert that name string into a readable GBK string (such as \u4e0a\u6d77 or \u5317\u4eac).I am usingString sname = new String(name.getBytes(), \"UTF-8\");byte[] gbkbytes = sname.getBytes(\"gb2312\");String gbkStr = new String( gbkbytes );System.out.println(gbkStr);but it's not printed right in GBK text???\u00a1\u00ec??:????12I have no clue how to proceed.\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: String.getBytes\n<<<code>>>: String sname = new String(name.getBytes(), \"UTF-8\");\nbyte[] gbkbytes = sname.getBytes(\"gb2312\");\nString gbkStr = new String(gbkbytes);\n<<<explanation>>>: The getBytes() method of the String class returns a byte array containing the encoded form of the string. In this case, the string is already encoded in UTF-8, so the getBytes() method is called with the \"UTF-8\" encoding to get the original bytes. Then, the bytes are converted to a byte array using the \"gb2312\" encoding, which is not a valid encoding for the GBK character set. Therefore, the resulting string is not in the correct GBK encoding. To convert a string to GBK encoding, you need to use a valid encoding for the GBK character set, such as \"gbk\"."}
