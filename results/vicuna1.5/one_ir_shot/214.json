{"api": "InputStream.read", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Reading all string from a server socket which has not been closed: :I have a problem with socket programming in Java. There is a server which has been written in python like this which I shouldn't not change.s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)s.connect((TCP_IP, TCP_PORT))s.send('from server\\nnewline\\0')data = s.recv(BUFFER_SIZE)s.close()Now I want to write a code in Java which read the string from a server. Something like this:public static String readStr(Socket client) throws IOException {        InputStreamReader inStream = new InputStreamReader(                client.getInputStream());        BufferedReader inBuff = new BufferedReader(inStream);        String answer = new String();        String str = inBuff.readLine();        while (str!=null) {            answer = answer.concat(str + \"\\n\");            str = inBuff.readLine();        }        answer = answer.substring(0, answer.length() - 1);        System.out.println(\"answer:\\n \"+answer);        return answer;    }But it seems that it blocks at line str = inBuff.readLine(); at the last line of the message. I tried the read() method but it was blocked too.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.io.InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: public static String readStr(Socket client) throws IOException {\nInputStream inputStream = client.getInputStream();\nInputStreamReader inputStreamReader = new InputStreamReader(inputStream);\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(inputStreamReader);\nStringBuilder answer = new StringBuilder();\nString str = bufferedReader.readLine();\nwhile (str != null) {\nanswer.append(str + \"\\n\");\nstr = bufferedReader.readLine();\n}\nanswer.deleteCharAt(answer.length() - 1);\nSystem.out.println(\"answer:\\n\" + answer);\nreturn answer.toString();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The read() method of the BufferedReader class reads a line of text from the underlying stream and returns it as a string. The readLine() method reads a complete line of text, including any newline characters, from the underlying stream and returns it as a string. The deleteCharAt() method deletes the last character of the string."}
