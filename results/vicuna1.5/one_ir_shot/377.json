USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to query OrientDB database for vertex in Java?: :I want to connect to an OrientDB. The OrientDB contains one unique node with the property \"SPECIAL-NODE\". I want to query the database for this node and print it out. I have one line of code that works using an iterator (see below) and one that does not (below at bottom). It seems like both should work yet only the first does, the second does not. Why is this the case?Thanks!// create Orient graph object and connect to database, works successfullyOrientGraph ograph = new OrientGraph(\"remote:localhost/test\", \"username\", \"password\");// this WORKS - finds the one special node and prints it outIterator<Vertex> i =ograph.getVertices(\"SPECIAL-NODE\", \"SPECIAL\").iterator();System.out.println(i.next());// this DOES NOT WORK. WHY???System.out.println(\"SPECIAL NODE: \" + ograph.getVertexByKey(\"SPECIAL-NODE\",   \"SPECIAL\"));\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: OrientGraph ograph = new OrientGraph(\"remote:localhost/test\", \"username\", \"password\");\nIterator<Vertex> i = ograph.getVertices(\"SPECIAL-NODE\", \"SPECIAL\").iterator();\nSystem.out.println(i.next());\n<<<explanation>>>: The getVertices() method returns an Iterator of Vertex objects that match the given query. The iterator is then used to retrieve the first element in the iterator using the next() method, which returns the next element in the iterator. In this case, the query \"SPECIAL-NODE\" is used to find the unique node with the property \"SPECIAL-NODE\" and the next() method is used to retrieve the first element in the iterator, which is the vertex object representing the unique node."}
