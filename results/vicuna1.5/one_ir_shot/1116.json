Improve this question                    I want to convert words containing alphabetical characters into a representative number in Java.  For example, four hundred four should evaluate to the number 404.If the letters are gibberish like asdf then that's an error.I know I can convert bare Characters to their ascii equivalent Integer, appending those together, but I only want the numbers behind the English word phrases extracted.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String input = \"four hundred four\";\nint[] digits = new int[4];\nfor (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {\nString token = StringTokenizer.nextToken(input, \"\\\\d+\");\nif (token != null) {\ndigits[i] = Integer.parseInt(token);\n}\n}\nint sum = 0;\nfor (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {\nsum += digits[i];\n}\nint result = sum % 100;\nif (result == 0) {\nresult = 100;\n}\nString output = \"'\" + result + \"'\";\n<<<explanation>>>: This code uses the StringTokenizer class to split the input string into tokens, where each token represents a digit. The nextToken() method of the StringTokenizer class is used to extract each token. The tokens are then parsed into integers and stored in an array. The sum of these integers is calculated and the result is obtained by taking the remainder of the sum when divided by 100. If the remainder is 0, it is set to 100. Finally, the result is converted to a string in the format '123' and stored in the output variable."}
