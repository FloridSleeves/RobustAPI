USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to get a generic type-safe Iterble from Iterable of other type, with a convertor? (Java 7): :In our project, we use proxies-based database API (Tinkerpop Frames), so we have a lot of loops like:    List<Link> links = new LinkedList<>();    for (LinkModel model : obj.getLinks())    {        Link l = new Link(model.getLink(), model.getDescription());        links.add(l);    }I would like to get rid of these for two reasons:To remove boilerplate codeFor larger lists, memory issues may arise.Is there a nice way to get an Iterable that takes from the other one and converts using given method? What I would like to do is:Iterable<Link> links_ = new IterableConverter<LinkModel, Link>(obj.getLinks()){    public Link from(LinkModel m){ return new Link(m.getLink(), m.getDescription()); }};I guess there's something like that in Java 8. I need this for Java 7.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: Iterable<LinkModel> links = obj.getLinks();\nIterator<LinkModel> iterator = links.iterator();\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\nLinkModel model = iterator.next();\nLink l = new Link(model.getLink(), model.getDescription());\nlinks.add(l);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: This code creates an Iterable<LinkModel> called links from the obj.getLinks() method. Then it creates an iterator for the links Iterable and uses a while loop to iterate through the links. In each iteration, it calls the next() method on the iterator to get the next LinkModel and creates a new Link object using the model and its description. Finally, it adds the new Link object to the links Iterable and moves to the next iteration. This way, it converts the LinkModel to Link and adds it to the links Iterable."}
