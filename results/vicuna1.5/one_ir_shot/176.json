USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Safely reading http request headers in java: :I'm building my own HTTP webserver in java and would like to implement some security measures while reading the http request header from a socket inputstream.I'm trying to prevent scenario's where someone sending extremely long single line headers or absurd amounts of header lines would cause memory overflows or other things you wouldn't want.I'm currently trying to do this by reading 8kb of data into a byte array and parse all the headers within the buffer I just created.But as far as I know this means your inputstream's current offset is always already 8kb from it's starting point, even if you had only 100bytes of header.the code I have so far:InputStream stream = socket.getInputStream();HashMap<String, String> headers = new HashMap<String, String>();byte [] buffer = new byte[8*1024];stream.read( buffer , 0 , 8*1024);ByteArrayInputStream bytestream = new ByteArrayInputStream( buffer );InputStreamReader streamReader = new InputStreamReader( bytestream );BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader( streamReader );String requestline = reader.readLine();for ( ;; ){    String line = reader.readLine();    if ( line.equals( \"\" ) )        break;    String[] header = line.split( \":\" , 2 );    headers.put( header[0] , header[1] ); //TODO: check for bad header}//if contentlength > 0//      read bodySo my question is, how can I be sure that I'm reading the body data (if any) starting from the correct position in the inputstream?I don't exactly use streams a lot so I don't really have a feel for them and google hasn't been helpful so far\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: InputStream stream = socket.getInputStream();\nByteArrayOutputStream bos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();\nInputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(stream);\nBufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);\nString line;\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\nif (line.equals(\"\")) {\nbreak;\n}\nString[] header = line.split(\":\", 2);\nif (header.length == 2) {\n// TODO: check for bad header\n}\nif (header[1].contains(\"Content-Length\")) {\nint contentLength = Integer.parseInt(header[1].split(\"\\\\D+\")[0]);\nbos.write(br.readBytes(contentLength - bos.size()));\n}\n}\nbyte [] buffer = new byte[8*1024];\nstream.read(buffer, 0, 8*1024);\nByteArrayInputStream bytestream = new ByteArrayInputStream(buffer);\nbos.close();\nbytestream.close();\nstream.close();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The read() method of the InputStream class reads a single character from the input stream and returns it as an int. The method blocks until a character is available, or an exception is thrown. To read a line of text, you can use the readLine() method of the BufferedReader class. To read the body data, you can use the readBytes() method of the BufferedReader class, which reads a specified number of bytes from the input stream and returns them as a byte array. To calculate the content length of the body, you can use the split() method of the String class to split the header into an array of strings, and then check if the second element of the array contains \"Content-Length\". If it does, you can use the parseInt() method of the String class to parse the value of the \"Content-Length\" header and use it to read the body data."}
