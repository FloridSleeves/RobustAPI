USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Extracting JSON value, which is an array: :I am trying to extract the value from a key-value pair in a JSONObect. Here is the structure:{\"key1 \":[\"dog\",\"cat\"],\"key2\":[\"house\",\"boat\"]}So, I want to extract the values dog and cat, also values house and boat. I tried the following in Java:    //obj - has this JSON.    Iterator iter = obj.keys();    for (int i=0; i<len; i++){        String key = (String)iter.next();        System.out.println(\"Key is --> \"+key);  //This is correctly giving me the keys.        System.out.println(\"Value is --> \"+clientDetails.getJSONArray(key)); //This is not working. I tried lots of other things but to no avail.     }Could somebody please guide me here.thanks,Kay\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: Iterator<String> iter = obj.keys();\nString key = (String)iter.next();\nSystem.out.println(\"Key is --> \" + key);\n<<<explanation>>>: The next() method of the Iterator interface returns the next element in the iteration order of the iterator. In this case, it returns the next key-value pair in the JSONObject, which is a String."}
