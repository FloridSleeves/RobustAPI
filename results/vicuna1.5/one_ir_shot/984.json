USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: eclipse junit system.in java: :I am trying to create a junit test on a method that calls for a user input using scanner and System.in.The method being tested looks like this:public void setUserAnswer(){    Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);    userAnswer = input.nextInt();}Currently, I am using the following set up in jUnit:StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();        sb.append(\"\");        sb.append((problem.getOperand1()+problem.getOperand2()));        String data = sb.toString();        System.setIn(new ByteArrayInputStream(data.getBytes()));operand1 and operand2 are random generated numbers which the user adds and enters the answer for.The problem I have is the System.setIn doesn't pass from the jUnit class to the class being tested.Help?\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: String.getBytes\n<<<code>>>: String data = \"12345\";\nbyte[] inputData = data.getBytes();\nSystem.setIn(new ByteArrayInputStream(inputData));\n<<<explanation>>>: The getBytes() method of the String class returns an array of bytes that represents the specified string. This method is used to convert a string to an array of bytes. The ByteArrayInputStream class is used to convert a byte array to a stream of bytes. This is used to set the input for the scanner in the tested method."}
