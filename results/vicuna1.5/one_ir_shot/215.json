USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How do you read from an InputStream in Java and convert to byte array?: :I am currently trying to read in data from a server response. I am using a Socket to connect to a server, creating a http GET request, then am using a Buffered Reader to read in data. Here is what the code looks like compacted:    Socket conn = new Socket(server, 80);    //Request made here    BufferedReader inFromServer = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(conn.getInputStream()));    String response;    while((response = inFromServer.readLine()) != null){        System.out.println(response);    }I would like to read in the data, instead of as a String, as a byte array, and write it to a file. How is this possible? Any help is greatly appreciated, thank you.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: byte[] byteArray = new byte[1024];\nint bytesRead = conn.getInputStream().read(byteArray);\nwhile (bytesRead > 0) {\nbyteArray = new byte[byteArray.length + 1];\nbytesRead = conn.getInputStream().read(byteArray);\n}\nbyteArray = byteArray.length > 0 ? byteArray : new byte[0];\nFileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(\"file.txt\");\nout.write(byteArray);\nout.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The read() method of the InputStream class reads a single byte of data from the stream and returns it as an int. This method blocks until a byte is available, or the end of the stream is reached. The byteArray is used to store the data read from the stream, and the FileOutputStream is used to write the byteArray to a file."}
