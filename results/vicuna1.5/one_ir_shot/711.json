{"api": "PrintWriter.write", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Split Flat File using Java: :I am fairly new to java and need some help.  I have flat file with 10 columns and a total of, lets say, 9750 rows.  All the rows are pipe delimited.  I need to split the file into 2000 rows each (5 files). How do I do this in Java?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: String filename = \"file\" + i + \".txt\";\nPrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(filename);\nfor (int i = 0; i < 2000; i++) {\nString row = readRowFromFile();\nwriter.println(row);\n}\nwriter.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: To split the flat file into 2000 rows each, you can use a for loop to read 2000 rows at a time and write each row to a new file. You can use the PrintWriter class to write the rows to the file. The filename can be generated using the i variable to create a unique filename for each file. The PrintWriter.close() method should be called to close the writer and ensure that all data is written to the file."}
