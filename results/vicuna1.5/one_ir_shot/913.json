Improve this question                    I have a large amount of data being sent from server to Javascript, which is taking quite a long time to load.I was wondering how I can implement compression at server and decompression in Javascript. I would appreciate any help.\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: String.getBytes\n<<<code>>>: String jsonString = \"{\\\"name\\\":\\\"John\\\",\\\"age\\\":30,\\\"city\\\":\\\"New York\\\"}\";\nbyte[] jsonBytes = jsonString.getBytes();\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The getBytes() method of the String class returns an array of bytes that represents the character sequence of this string. This method can be used to compress the string by converting it to a byte array before sending it over the network. In JavaScript, you can use the built-in `Buffer` object to decompress the byte array and return the original string."}
