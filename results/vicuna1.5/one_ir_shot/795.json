USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: PrintWriter to append data if file exist: :I have a savegame file called mysave.sav and I want to add data to this file if the file already exists. If the file doesn't exists, I want to create the file and then add the data.Adding data works fine. But appending data overwrites existing data. I followed the instructions of axtavt here (PrintWriter append method not appending).     String savestr = \"mysave.sav\";     File f = new File(savestr);    PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(savestr);    if ( f.exists() && !f.isDirectory() ) {        out = new PrintWriter(new FileOutputStream(new File(savestr), true));        out.append(mapstring);        out.close();    }    else {        out.println(mapstring);        out.close();    }where mapstring is the string I want to append. Can you help me? Thank you!\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: String savestr = \"mysave.sav\";\nFile f = new File(savestr);\nPrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(savestr);\nif (f.exists() && !f.isDirectory()) {\nout.write(mapstring);\n} else {\nout.println(mapstring);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The write() method of the PrintWriter class writes the specified string to the file. If the file already exists, the existing data will be overwritten. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created and the data will be written to it."}
