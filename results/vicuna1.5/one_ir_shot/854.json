{"api": "RandomAccessFile.read", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to choose RandomAccessFile dynamically?: :I had written a program using RandomAccessFile class to read binary data.  The code is as followsRandomAccessFile in = new RandomAccessFile('BOT.GRD', \"r\");in.read(a);Now I want to choose file dynamically rather than providing directly as above. I tried a lot and I was unable to do that. Can any one help me on this?\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: RandomAccessFile.read\n<<<code>>>: RandomAccessFile in = new RandomAccessFile(\"file.txt\", \"r\");\nint a = in.read();\n<<<explanation>>>: The read() method of the RandomAccessFile class reads a single character from the file and returns it as an integer. To read more than one character, you can use the read(char[] array) method, which reads characters into an array and returns the number of characters read."}
