{"api": "Activity.setContentView", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: AsyncTask onPostExecute UI Changes: :It is always the little things that stump me for hours.I have an onPostExecute method from an AsyncTask class that looks like so: @Override    protected void onPostExecute(String s) {                               super.onPostExecute(s);        showColumnCounts();        dataDownloadCompleteToast();    }The toast works just fine. However, my showColumnCounts() method refuses to work. It works just fine on the main thread. I use it during onCreate() just not here. I thought the onPostExecute ran on the UI thread?Here is my showColumnCounts() method if it is relevant. public void showColumnCounts() {    TextView totalView = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.totalColumn2);    TextView ignoredView = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.ignoredColumn2);    TextView rView = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.rColumn2);    Cursor c = myDB.getEmptyRColumn(\"\");    int count = c.getCount();    if (count == 0) {        c.close();        return;    }    String unread = String.valueOf(count);    String total = getTotalCount();    int tTotal = Integer.parseInt(total);    int r = tTotal - count;    String read = String.valueOf(r);    totalView.setText(total);    ignoredView.setText(unread);    rView.setText(read);    c.close();}I've been fiddling with it for a while now assuming the answer should be obvious but I'm calling uncle. Can't figure it.Edit***** 6/30I THINK I've found my problem. In my background thread I am using a parse.com method \"query.findInBackground\" which I assume is starting a third thread? I'm trying to update this to \"query.find\" and I'm hoping that will fix.\nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Activity.setContentView\n<<<code>>>: setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n<<<explanation>>>: This code sets the content view of the activity to the layout specified in R.layout.activity\\_main. It is typically used to inflate a layout file and assign it to the activity's root view."}
