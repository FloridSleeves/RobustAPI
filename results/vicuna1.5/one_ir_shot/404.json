{"api": "Iterator.next", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Is there a conventional iterator interface in Java which separates traversal from element access?: :For my application, element access is expensive, so java.util.Iterator is no use.  I want something more like C++ iterators, where I can move the pointer around without returning an element.  Is there something in the standard library like this, or has some de facto standard interface evolved through custom?  (If not, please don't waste your time posting code snippets - I'm quite able to think up reasonable names which will do the job).  \nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: import java.util.Iterator;\nclass IteratorExample {\nIterator<String> iterator = null;\nString[] array = {\"Hello\", \"World\", \"Java\"};\niterator = array.iterator();\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\nSystem.out.println(iterator.next());\n}\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The next() method of the Iterator interface returns the next element in the iteration order of this iterator. This method does not return the element, it just moves the iterator to the next position. This is similar to the C++ iterator concept, where the iterator moves forward to the next element without returning it."}
