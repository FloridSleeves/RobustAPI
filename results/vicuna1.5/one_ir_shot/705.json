USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to read a specified String from an input file, then read the next word after it: :In Java I want to be able to have two JTextFields that take in String. One is a username and the other a password. to \"login\", the program will search through a file --> accounts.txt  and will search first for \"usrnm:\", once it finds it, it takes the word right after the :the same goes for the password but it searches for \"pswrd:\".Here's what iv'e got so far:    public void checkCredentials() {    try {        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(new File(\"accounts.txt\")));        String text = br.readLine();        text = text.toLowerCase();        text.split(\"usrnm:\");        System.out.println(\"username: \" + userInput);    } catch (Exception ex) {        ex.printStackTrace();    }}any help is appreciated!\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"accounts.txt\");\nwriter.write(\"usrnm:\");\nwriter.write(userInput);\nwriter.write(\"\\\\n\");\nwriter.write(\"pswrd:\");\nwriter.write(passwordInput);\nwriter.write(\"\\\\n\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The PrintWriter class is used to write text to a file. The write() method is used to write a string to the file. The first argument is the file to write to, and the second argument is the text to write. The \\\\n escape sequence is used to write a newline character to the file."}
