USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to create OAuth HMAC-SHA1 signature on GAE/J?: :EDIT: java equivalent to php's hmac-SHA1(well hopefully, trying a.t.m.)My understanding is that to create a signature I need a 'base string' and a 'key'. I guess I know how to create the base string, and I assume I'm supposed to use 'OAuth Consumer Secret' that Google have assigned to my app as the key.But what am I supposed to do with these two to obtain the signature? Is there any HMAC-class on GAE/Java?Would it play if I just stored somewhere what OAuth Playground generates for me? Is it how you do it? Or does OAuth signature have some expiration date?(I tried AuthSub before but failed too, even though it looks quite simple. Also OAuth seems like more 'standard' to me, so I'd like to stick with OAuth.)\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: String.getBytes\n<<<code>>>: String baseString = \"my base string\";\nString key = \"my key\";\nbyte[] signature = baseString.getBytes();\nbyte[] secretKey = key.getBytes();\nHmacSHA1 hmac = new HmacSHA1(new SecretKeySpec(secretKey, \"HmacSHA1\"));\nbyte[] hash = hmac.doFinal(signature);\nString signatureString = new String(hash);\n<<<explanation>>>: To create an OAuth HMAC-SHA1 signature in GAE/J, you need to first convert the base string and key to byte arrays. Then, create an instance of the HmacSHA1 class with the secret key (in this case, the OAuth Consumer Secret). Use the doFinal() method to calculate the hash of the signature byte array with the secret key. Finally, convert the hash back to a string to obtain the signature. The OAuth signature does not have an expiration date, but it is important to ensure that the secret key is kept secure and not shared with anyone."}
