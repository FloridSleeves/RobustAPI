{"api": "InputStream.read", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: When does getInputStream() return null?: :When we call Socket.getInputStream() the second time after creating client it returns null. What can I do?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: Socket socket = new Socket(\"localhost\", 1234);\nInputStream inputStream = socket.getInputStream();\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\nint bytesRead = inputStream.read(buffer);\nwhile (bytesRead > 0) {\n// process the data\nbytesRead = inputStream.read(buffer);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The getInputStream() method returns null when the stream has been closed. To avoid this, you can use a try-with-resources statement to automatically close the input stream after use. Alternatively, you can check if the input stream is null before reading from it, using the isNull() method of the InputStream class."}
