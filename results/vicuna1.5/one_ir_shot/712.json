{"api": "PrintWriter.write", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Is there any way to make a JSP print carriage returns (CR)?: :I'm currently generating some vCards using JSP. I found out some platforms don't recognize these generated vCards unless their lines are separated by Carriage Returns (CR), and JSP seems to use just Line Feed (LF) by default to separate lines.Do you guys know any way to tell the JSP to include a CR between each line?I hope someone has a clue, cause I haven't found much out there...Thanks in advance!\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter out = pageContext.getOut();\nout.write(\"\\r\\n\");\nout.write(\"Line 1\");\nout.write(\"\\r\\n\");\nout.write(\"Line 2\");\nout.write(\"\\r\\n\");\nout.write(\"Line 3\");\nout.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The write() method of the PrintWriter class writes characters to the output stream. The \"\\r\\n\" sequence is the carriage return and line feed characters, which can be used to add a line break. The close() method should be called to close the PrintWriter and release any resources."}
