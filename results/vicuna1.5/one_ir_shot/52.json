{"api": "BufferedReader.readLine", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Reading data from text line by line in java: :I'm making a game in Java, but can't figure out how to get information from a text file so that I can load the game. I have the saved files set up so that on every line there is the name of a method in my Main program. What I need to do is to look in a certain line for text and execute the method that the text is referring to.\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"file.txt\"));\nString line = reader.readLine();\nif (line.contains(\"methodName\")) {\n// execute method\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The readLine() method of the BufferedReader class reads a single line of text from the file and returns it as a string. The contains() method checks if a string contains a specified substring. This can be used to check if the line of text contains the method name you are looking for."}
