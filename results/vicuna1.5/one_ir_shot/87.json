{"api": "DataOutputStream.write", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Transferring byte[] over sockets: :I have a byte array that has to be sent to the server.byte[] b=new byte[]{(byte)0xFE,0x01,0x01,0x32,0x00,0x00,(byte)0xFD};My client code for sending isPrintStream pw=new PrintStream(s.getOuputStream());pw.Println(b);My server code for receiving is InputStreamReader in=new InputStreamreader();BufferedReader br=new BufferedReader(in);String s=br.readline();System.out.println(\"client sent :\" + s);when server receives and prints the output i am getting the output as client sent:[B@1f4917a7I want the output same as what is sent: FE 01 01 32 00 00 FD\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: DataOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>: DataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(s.getOutputStream());\ndos.writeByte(0xFE);\ndos.writeByte(0x01);\ndos.writeByte(0x01);\ndos.writeByte(0x32);\ndos.writeByte(0x00);\ndos.writeByte(0x00);\ndos.writeByte(0xFD);\n<<<explanation>>>: The writeByte() method of the DataOutputStream class writes a single byte to the stream. This is a terminal operation."}
