{"api": "String.getBytes", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Generate SHA 256 Hash using multiple values in Java/Android: :I have two objects based on which SHA 256 Hash needs to be generated.First value is a JSONObjectSecond value is a String variable.Ideally, what i need isHash hash= new Hash(JSONObject, String);I couldn't find any hash generation methods which takes two values.Could anyone help me with this?.\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: String.getBytes\n<<<code>>>: JSONObject jsonObject = new JSONObject(\"{\\\"key\\\":\\\"value\\\"}\");\nString string = \"hello world\";\nbyte[] hash = hash(jsonObject.toString(), string);\n<<<explanation>>>: The getBytes() method of the String class returns an array of bytes that, when interpreted as a byte string, represent the original string. This method is used to convert a string to its byte representation. The hash() method is a custom method that takes two strings and returns the SHA 256 hash of their concatenation. It is not a built-in method and must be implemented separately."}
