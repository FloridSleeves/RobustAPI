Update the question so it focuses on one problem only by editing this post.Closed 9 years ago.                        Improve this question                    I have a database with two tables , First one contains 2 columns: group_ID , group_name . And the second one : ID, Word, Definition , word_group_id . This is the prototype of the function which I am going to write WordContainer [] findWordsByGroupId(int id);and this is the WordContainer class:public class WordContainer {      String word;      String definition;      int id  = -1;public WordContainer (int id , String word ,String definition){    this.id = id;    this.word = word;    this.definition = definition;}public void setWord (String word){    this.word = word;}public void setDefinition (String definition){    this.definition = definition;}public String getWord (){    return this.word;}public String getDefinition (){    return this.definition;}}So the question is , How to write a SQLite query which will find all the rows (or ids of those rows)which have the given group_id ; \nPlease using this api: SQLiteDatabase.query.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: SQLiteDatabase.query\n<<<code>>>: SQLiteDatabase db = ...;\nString[] projection = new String[]{WordContainer._ID, WordContainer.WORD, WordContainer.DEFINITION};\nString selection = WordContainer.GROUP_ID + \"=?\";\nString[] selectionArgs = new String[]{id};\nCursor cursor = db.query(WordContainer.TABLE_NAME, projection, selection, selectionArgs, null, null, null);\n<<<explanation>>>: The query() method of the SQLiteDatabase class allows you to execute a raw SQL query on the database. The first argument is the name of the table you want to query, the second argument is an array of column names to return, the third argument is the selection criteria, the fourth argument is an array of values to match against the selection criteria, and the remaining arguments are optional. In this case, we are selecting the ID, word, and definition columns from the WordContainer table where the group\\_id is equal to the given id."}
