{"api": "DataOutputStream.write", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Java OutputStream/TelnetClient can't write string longer than 1955 characters: :I've had to create a client that takes requests from sockets and send them to our telnet legacy server and return the servers response. It's worked great until we recently realized that some of the commands I send are getting cut off at 1955 characters. The way everything is set up is that I send the server 1 line commands and it sends back 1 line responses. I can't figure out a way to send longer commands via DataOutputStream through the TelnetClient. Am I doing this wrong or is this just a limitation of one of these objects?public void connect() {    try {        tc = new TelnetClient();        TerminalTypeOptionHandler ttopt = new TerminalTypeOptionHandler(\"VT100\", false, false, true, false);        EchoOptionHandler echoopt = new EchoOptionHandler(true, false, true, false);        SuppressGAOptionHandler gaopt = new SuppressGAOptionHandler(true, true, true, true);        try {            tc.addOptionHandler(ttopt);            tc.addOptionHandler(echoopt);            tc.addOptionHandler(gaopt);        } catch (InvalidTelnetOptionException e) {            ServerConsole.log(e.getMessage());        }        tc.connect(\"192.168.1.8\", 2010);        in = new DataInputStream(tc.getInputStream());        out = new DataOutputStream(tc.getOutputStream());        login();    } catch (IOException ex) {        ServerConsole.log(ex.getMessage());    }}//This is a watered down version of my write method just to show the basic idea of whats happeningpublic String write(String command) {    String finalCommand = command+\"\\n\";    byte[] comm = finalCommand.getBytes();    out.write(comm);    out.flush();    response = in.readLine();    response = in.readLine();    return response;}\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: DataOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>: String command = \"This is a long command that needs to be sent to the server.\";\nbyte[] commandBytes = command.getBytes();\nDataOutputStream out = new DataOutputStream(tc.getOutputStream());\nout.write(commandBytes);\nout.flush();\nString response = in.readLine();\n<<<explanation>>>: The write() method of the DataOutputStream class writes a sequence of bytes to the underlying output stream. In this case, the command is first converted to a byte array using the getBytes() method, and then the byte array is written to the output stream using the write() method. The flush() method is called to ensure that the data is written to the output stream before the response is read. This should allow for longer commands to be sent to the server without being cut off."}
