{"api": "StringTokenizer.nextToken", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can i pass all integers i this loop and stop before the last line: :this is my inputfirst line5 63 42 32 51 0word 2 2 4i need to add all the integers to a graph but not the last line (word 1 2 4).. i have splitted the first line (first line etc.) and put them in a arraylist.. No problem therebut then i have this for-loopfor (int i = 0; i < (amount of lines); i++) {        StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());        graph.addEdge(Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken()), Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken()));    }i cant write in the code how many times i want it to put integers, because my code should run generally with other inputs...How can i make it stop before the last line, i still need to be able to use the last bufferreaderline\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String line = in.readLine();\nint[] integers = line.split(\"\\\\s+\");\nfor (int i = 0; i < integers.length; i++) {\ngraph.addEdge(Integer.parseInt(StringTokenizer.nextToken(integers[i])), Integer.parseInt(StringTokenizer.nextToken(integers[i])));\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The nextToken() method of the StringTokenizer class returns the next token in the input string. This method returns null if the end of the input has been reached. By using this method in a for loop, you can iterate through the input string and extract the integers one by one, without having to know the number of integers in advance. This way, you can make the code more flexible and reusable for different inputs."}
