The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Problems with String Tokenizer: :                                It's difficult to tell what is being asked here.

Closed 10 years ago.I have a set of 3 strings, each in different lines, which are integers separated by spaces.1 1 23 4 44 5 5I wanted to input them into a character array, and I used StringTokenizer in this manner:for(int j=0;i<n1;i++){  s2=bure.readLine();           st1=new StringTokenizer(s2);  for(int k=0;k<n2;k++){    a[j][k]=Integer.parseInt(st1.nextToken());  }      }Where n1 and n2 are the number of rows and columns.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String s2 = bure.readLine();\nStringTokenizer st1 = new StringTokenizer(s2);\nfor(int k=0;k<n2;k++){\nint a[j][k]=Integer.parseInt(st1.nextToken());\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The nextToken() method of the StringTokenizer class returns the next token in the string. This method returns the next non-whitespace character in the string. This method returns null if the end of the string has been reached."}
