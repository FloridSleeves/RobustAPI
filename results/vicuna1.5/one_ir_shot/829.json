{"api": "PrintWriter.write", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Console output into text file: :code to convert HTML file to .txt file. code for reference..public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"D:/ticket.htm\"));    String line;    while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {        sb.append(line).append(System.getProperty(\"line.separator\"));    }    String nohtml = sb.toString().replaceAll(\"\\\\<.*?>\", \"\");    String nospace = nohtml.replaceAll(            \"^\\\\s+|\\\\s+$|\\\\s*(\\n)\\\\s*|(\\\\s)\\\\s*\", \"$1$2\");    String new1 = nospace.replace(\"\\t\", \" \");    System.out.println(new1);    PrintWriter outs = new PrintWriter(\"D:/text123.txt\");    outs.write(new1);    outs.println(new1);    outs.close();}new1 contains text(HTML output) which I am able to print line by line in the eclipse console,but when am trying to copy that text into text file (text123.txt), the text is copied in the same line. I need to same console output to be copied in the text file i.e line by line.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter outs = new PrintWriter(\"D:/text123.txt\"); outs.write(new1); outs.println(new1); outs.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The write() method of the PrintWriter class writes the specified string to the output stream. This method can be called repeatedly to write multiple strings to the output stream. The println() method of the PrintWriter class writes the specified string to the output stream and adds a newline character at the end of the string. This method can be called repeatedly to write multiple strings to the output stream. The close() method of the PrintWriter class closes the output stream."}
