USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: JAVA Need a condition to check whether the entire 2D array is full: :I'm making a game. In the game there is a grid that is populated by cells. Each cell has a partner (same type of cell). There should be 24 total cells which would mean 12 different pairs of cells. For example a cell can be type 1, there will be two type 1 cells on the grid.All the way until type 12.What I'm trying to achieve with my code is to randomly generate a row and column and then place a cell of type 1 on it. AGAIN, generate random row and column and place type 1 cell on it.Then increment type.Now what I am struggling with is the condition that will make sure my entire grid is fully populated with cells.Further more a condition that makes sure that once a cell has been placed at a spot on the grid, it cannot be replaced by another cell.Here is the code that I've come up with for now.     int type =1;    int row=0;    int column=0;    board[row][column] = new Cell(this, type, row, column);    while(board[row][column] != null){      if(type <=12){      row = generator.nextInt(4);      column = generator.nextInt(6);            board[row][column] = new Cell(this, type, row, column);      type++;        if (type < 13){      row = generator.nextInt(4);            column = generator.nextInt(6);            board[row][column] = new Cell(this, type, row, column);      row = generator.nextInt(4);      column = generator.nextInt(6);      board[row][column] = new Cell(this, type, row, column);      add(board[row][column]);} //Adding a Cell object **board is a 2d array of type Cell**      }  }  }Tried my best to explain the problem in the most simple terms\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: Iterator<Cell> iterator = board.iterator();\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\nint row = iterator.next().getRow();\nint column = iterator.next().getColumn();\nif (row == 0 && column == 0) {\nbreak;\n}\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The hasNext() method of the Iterator interface returns true if there is at least one more element in the iteration. The next() method of the Iterator interface returns the next element in the iteration. By using these methods, we can iterate through the elements of the board array and check if the first row and first column have been reached. Once the first row and column have been reached, we can break out of the loop to prevent further iterations. This will ensure that the entire grid is fully populated with cells and that a cell cannot be replaced by another cell."}
