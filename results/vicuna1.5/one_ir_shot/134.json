{"api": "File.mkdirs", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Cannot create directory but files: :Here are things I have done:<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\" />andpublic void createMyFolder(){   File directory = new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().getPath() + \"/myfolder/\");   directory.mkdir(); //I had also tried mkdirs()   File file= new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().getPath() + \"/t1.dat\");   try {      file.createNewFile();   } catch (IOException e) {}}I tested 3 devices and one of them threw exception:java.io.IOException: Cannot create dir /mnt/sdcard/myfoldert1.dat was created successfully in /mnt/sdcard/ but myfolder was not.  The device is Xperia Ion with Android version 4.0.4. What's wrong about it and how can I fix it?Edit: I had tried to create folders by some applications, like File Manager.And they also failed to create although the sdcard is writable and readable.I think my phone has some \"protections\" which do not allow me to create folders in sd card.But it's funny that my phone allows me to create files instead.public boolean isExternalStorageWritable() {    String state = Environment.getExternalStorageState();    if (Environment.MEDIA_MOUNTED.equals(state)) {        return true;    }    return false;}/* Checks if external storage is available to at least read */public boolean isExternalStorageReadable() {    String state = Environment.getExternalStorageState();    if (Environment.MEDIA_MOUNTED.equals(state) ||            Environment.MEDIA_MOUNTED_READ_ONLY.equals(state)) {        return true;    }    return false;}\nPlease using this api: File.mkdirs.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: File.mkdirs\n<<<code>>>: File directory = new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().getPath() + \"/myfolder/\");\ndirectory.mkdirs();\n<<<explanation>>>: The mkdirs() method of the File class creates a directory and any missing parent directories as needed. This method is useful when creating directories with a path that does not exist. It will throw an exception if the directory already exists."}
