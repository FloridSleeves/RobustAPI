The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Trim string after newline: :My string is say :str1=\"ashdef\";I want to remove anything after the newline so my desired string would be only \"ash\".How do I do this, One thing could be I could trim this and then substring it . Any other ways which I can do this.Thanks \nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String str = \"My string is say :str1=\\\"ashdef\\\";I want to remove anything after the newline so my desired string would be only \\\"ash\\\".How do I do this, One thing could be I could trim this and then substring it .

This method returns the next token in the string, or null if the end of the string is reached. The tokens can then be used to remove anything after the newline. Another way is to use the split method and the trim method to remove any whitespace characters from the string."}
