{"api": "StringTokenizer.nextToken", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to split a String with multiple delimiters in Java: :I am trying to have the desired outputs like this:5555555555by using codes:public class Split {/** * @param args */public static void main(String[] args) {    // TODO Auto-generated method stub    String phoneNumber = \"(555) 555-5555\";    String[] splitNumberParts = phoneNumber.split(\" |-\");    for(String part : splitNumberParts)        System.out.println(part);But dont know how to get rid of the \"( )\" from the first element.Thanks in advance.Regards\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String phoneNumber = \"(555) 555-5555\";\nString[] splitNumberParts = phoneNumber.split(\"\\\\(|-\\\\)\");\nfor(String part : splitNumberParts) {\nif (part.equals(\"(\")) {\nsplitNumberParts[0] = splitNumberParts[0].substring(1);\n}\nif (part.equals(\")\")) {\nsplitNumberParts[splitNumberParts.length - 1] = splitNumberParts[splitNumberParts.length - 1].substring(0, splitNumberParts[splitNumberParts.length - 1].length() - 1);\n}\nSystem.out.println(part);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The StringTokenizer class is used to split a string into a sequence of tokens, where each token is a single character or a string that represents a single character. The nextToken() method of the StringTokenizer class is used to retrieve the next token from the string. The split() method of the String class is used to split a string into an array of substrings. The regular expression \"\\\\(|-\\\\)\" is used to split the string based on the delimiter \"|-\". The if-else condition is used to remove the \"( \" and \" )\" from the first and last element of the array respectively."}
