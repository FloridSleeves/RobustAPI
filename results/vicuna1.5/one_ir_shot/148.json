{"api": "InputStream.read", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to pipe stream to java program?: :Under cmd.exe, I can do like this:dir *.*|grep ....I want to do this to java programdir *.i|java test What I should do in my java test class?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.io.InputStream\n<<<code>>>: InputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream(\"file.txt\");\nint data = inputStream.read();\nwhile (data != -1) {\nInputStreamReader inputReader = new InputStreamReader(inputStream);\nchar c = (char) inputReader.read();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The read() method of the InputStream class reads a single byte of data from the input stream. This method blocks until a byte of data is available, or an exception is thrown. To read a stream of characters, you can use an InputStreamReader and read() method on it."}
