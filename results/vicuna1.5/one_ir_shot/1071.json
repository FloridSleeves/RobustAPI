The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: string tokenizer stopping after first line: :I have a text file I am trying to break up with string tokenizer. Here is a few lines of the text file:Mary Smith 1 James Johnson 2 Patricia Williams 3 I am trying to break up into first name, last name and Customer ID. I have so far been able to do that but it stops after mary smith. Here is my code:  public static void createCustomerList(BufferedReader infileCust,            CustomerList customerList) throws IOException{                String  firstName;            String  lastName;            int  custId;            //take first line of strings before breaking them up to first last and cust ID            String StringToBreak = infileCust.readLine();            //split up the string with string tokenizer            StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(StringToBreak);            firstName = st.nextToken();            while(st.hasMoreElements())            {            lastName =  st.nextToken();            custId = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());            CustomerElement CustomerObject = new CustomerElement();            CustomerObject.setCustInfo(firstName,lastName,custId);            customerList.addToList(CustomerObject);            }    }\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String firstName = StringTokenizer.nextToken(StringToBreak);\n<<<explanation>>>: The nextToken() method of the StringTokenizer class returns the next token in the string. This method returns null if there are no more tokens in the string. In this case, we want to stop after the first line, so we need to check if the nextToken() method returns null before adding the last name and custId to the customer list."}
