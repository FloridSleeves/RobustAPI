USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to identify a special character in a file using java: :I have a .doc file with contains header before the \u00d0\u00cf , So I need to remove all the characters that are exist before the \u00d0\u00cf.Example :  asdfasdfasdfasfasdfasf\u00d0\u00cf9asjdfkjI have used the below code.InputStream is = new   FileInputStream(\"D:\\\\Users\\\\Vinoth\\\\workspace\\\\Testing\\\\Testing_2.doc\");    DataInputStream dis = new DataInputStream(is);    OutputStream os = new  FileOutputStream(\"D:\\\\Users\\\\Vinoth\\\\workspace\\\\Testing\\\\Testing_3.doc\");    DataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(os);    byte[] buff = new byte[dis.available()];    dis.readFully(buff);    char temp = 0;    boolean start = false;    try{    for(byte b:buff){        char c = (char)b;        if(temp == '\u00d0' && c == '\u00cf' ){            start = true;          }        if(start){            dos.write(c);        }        temp = c;    }However , it is not writing anything in my file as the first if condition is not getting satisfied. Please advise how can I perform this .\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: DataOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>: OutputStream os = new FileOutputStream(\"D:\\\\Users\\\\Vinoth\\\\workspace\\\\Testing\\\\Testing_3.doc\"); DataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(os);\n<<<explanation>>>: To write the characters to the file, you need to use the write() method of the DataOutputStream class. This method writes the specified byte to the output stream. In this case, you need to write the character that you want to remove from the file. You can use a loop to iterate through the file and write the characters one by one. In the first if condition, you need to check if the character is '\u00d0' and not '\u00cf'. If it is '\u00d0', then you need to set the start flag to true, so that the characters after '\u00d0' are written to the file."}
