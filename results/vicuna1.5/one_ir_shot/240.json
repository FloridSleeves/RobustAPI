{"api": "InputStream.read", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: how to get wifi password from cmd with java: :I'm trying supply my wifi connection password with java. but I have to do it as an admin.try {    Process p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(\"netsh.exe wlan show profiles name=superonline key=clear\");    BufferedReader bf = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(p.getInputStream()));    while (bf.readLine() != null)        System.out.println(bf.readLine());} catch (Exception ex) {    ex.printStackTrace();}When I try it as a standard user:When I try it as administrator:How can do this in java code?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: Process p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(\"netsh.exe wlan show profiles name=superonline key=clear\");\nBufferedReader bf = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(p.getInputStream()));\nString line = bf.readLine();\nwhile (line != null) {\nSystem.out.println(line);\nline = bf.readLine();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The readLine() method of the BufferedReader class reads a single line of text from the input stream and returns it as a string. The getInputStream() method returns the input stream of the process. The readLine() method of the InputStream class reads a single line of text from the input stream and returns it as a string. The while loop continues to read lines from the input stream until there is no more data to read."}
