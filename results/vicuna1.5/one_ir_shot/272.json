{"api": "Iterator.next", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Java equivalents of C# String.Format() and String.Join(): :I know this is a bit of a newbie question, but are there equivalents to C#'s string operations in Java?Specifically, I'm talking about String.Format and String.Join.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: String[] strings = {\"Hello\", \"world\", \"!\"};\nString joinedString = Arrays.stream(strings).map(Iterator.next).collect(Collectors.joining(\", \"));\n<<<explanation>>>: The map() method of the Stream interface applies a function to each element of the stream and returns a new stream containing the results. The collect() method of the Stream interface is used to collect the elements of a stream into a single result. The joining() method of the Collector interface is used to join the elements of a stream into a single string."}
