The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Conditionally Adding String in StringTokenizer: :I am currently stuck with a very simple yet confusing issue while using StringTokenizer. What I am trying to achieve is below:I have a URL String as:http://xxx:port/jira/rest/api/2/search?jql=project='TP' AND(status='Ready for INT Deployment' or status = 'Ready for UAT Deployment')Above is the base string. Now I want to dynamically add more query parameters to the above URL as below: \"AND (key=NN-1234 OR key=NN-4321 OR key=NN-65343.....)\"Here is my code:private String getPartialIssueList() {    String listFromProperties = getPropertyValue(\"propagateList\");    StringTokenizer token = new StringTokenizer(listFromProperties, \",\");    StringBuilder partialListString = new StringBuilder();    partialListString.append(\" AND key=\");    while (token.hasMoreElements()) {        partialListString.append(token.nextElement() + \" OR key=\" + token.nextElement());    }    return partialListString.toString();}Somehow this only works if I have 2 inputs. What I want is, after the base url an \"AND\" should be added followed by opening brackets \"(\" and then key=\"value from properties\", value 2 from properties, value 3 from properties, then closing brace \")\". Irrespective of how many JIRA ID's I have in properties file, it should keep on adding \"OR key=NN-5432 OR key=\"NN-9875\" and so on..This is the output I am looking for:http://xxx:port/jira/rest/api/2/search?jql=project='TP' AND (status='Ready for INT Deployment' or status = 'Ready for UAT Deployment') AND (key=NN-09876 OR key=NN-09873 OR key=NN-09376 OR key=NN-02876)Currently values for propagateList in the properties file ispropagateList=\"NN-09876\",\"NN-65432\",\"NN-65430\"Can someone please help out on this?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String baseUrl = \"http://xxx:port/jira/rest/api/2/search?jql=project='TP' AND(status='Ready for INT Deployment' or status = 'Ready for UAT Deployment')\";\nString token = baseUrl + \" AND \";\nwhile (listFromProperties.hasMoreTokens()) {\nString keyValue = listFromProperties.nextToken();\ntoken += \"(\" + keyValue + \" OR key=\" + keyValue + \")\";\n}\nreturn token;\n<<<explanation>>>: The nextToken() method of the StringTokenizer class returns the next token in the stream. This method returns the next non-whitespace character in the stream. In this case, we are using the nextToken() method to append the \"AND\" operator and the \"OR key=\" operator to the base URL. We are also using the nextToken() method to append the key-value pairs to the \"OR key=\" operator. We are using a while loop to iterate through the listFromProperties and append each key-value pair to the token. Finally, we are returning the token which contains the complete URL with all the query parameters."}
