{"api": "StringTokenizer.nextToken", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Reading Email Addresses as Tokens: :How can I read an email address as a token?I saw that the tokenizer method has a limit of 16 bits of length, well my token is like this:command emailtest@somewhere.com 50I want to be able to store the email (can be any email address) and the number (can vary from 5-1500).  I dont care about the command token.My code looks like this:String test2 = command.substring(7);StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(test2);String email = st.nextToken();String amount = st.nextToken();\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String test2 = command.substring(7);\nStringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(test2);\nString email = st.nextToken();\nString amount = st.nextToken();\n<<<explanation>>>: The nextToken() method of the StringTokenizer class returns the next token in the input string. In this case, the email address is the first token and the amount is the second token."}
