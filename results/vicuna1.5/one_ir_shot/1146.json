(5 answers)                            Closed 9 years ago.I am trying to fill an arrayList with objects created from reading integers from a text file that represent points (two integers per line).  I'm attempting to do this in a loop.  The ArrayList seems to fill, but when I print it out after, all the elements in each index are the same as the last element added to the ArrayList.  This seems to have something to do with each arrayList index pointing to the object (my newbie guess).  Do I have to create a unique object for each arrayList entry? Is there an easy way to add to this code to do this?public class Point2DDemo extends Point2D<Double>{    ArrayList<Point2DDemo> Points = new ArrayList<Point2DDemo>(7);    /**     * Constructor for objects of class Point2DDemo     */    public Point2DDemo()    {    }    public Point2DDemo(double first, double second)    {        setFirst(first);        setSecond(second);    }    public void putPair(double point1, double point2){        this.setFirst(point1);        this.setSecond(point2);    }    /**     *      *      * @param  y   a sample parameter for a method     * @return     the sum of x and y      */    public void createList()    {        FileIO readFile = new FileIO();        readFile.openInputFile();        String pointLine = null;        Point2DDemo newPoints = new Point2DDemo();        StringTokenizer stringSplit = null;        while(readFile.hasInputLine())        {           pointLine = readFile.readInputLine();           stringSplit = new StringTokenizer(pointLine);           double pointX = Double.parseDouble(stringSplit.nextToken());           double pointY = Double.parseDouble(stringSplit.nextToken());           newPoints.putPair(pointX, pointY);           Points.add(newPoints);        }        for(int i = 0; i < Points.size(); i++)         System.out.println(Points.get(i));         readFile.closeInputFile();    }\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String pointLine = null;\nStringTokenizer stringSplit = null;\nwhile(readFile.hasInputLine())\n{\npointLine = readFile.readInputLine();\nstringSplit = new StringTokenizer(pointLine);\ndouble pointX = Double.parseDouble(stringSplit.nextToken());\ndouble pointY = Double.parseDouble(stringSplit.nextToken());\nnewPoints.putPair(pointX, pointY);\nPoints.add(newPoints);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that the newPoints object is being created and added to the ArrayList each time a new line is read from the file, but it is not being reset to its initial state before the next iteration of the loop. As a result, the same object is being added to the ArrayList multiple times, causing all the elements in each index to be the same as the last element added to the ArrayList. To fix this, you can reset the newPoints object to its initial state before the next iteration of the loop by using the following code:\n```\nnewPoints = new Point2DDemo();\n```\nYou can add this line after the following line:\n```\nstringSplit = new StringTokenizer(pointLine);\n```\nThis will ensure that each iteration of the loop creates a new Point2DDemo object and adds it to the ArrayList, rather than adding the same object multiple times."}
