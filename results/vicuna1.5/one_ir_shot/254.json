{"api": "InputStream.read", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Java copy part of InputStream to OutputStream: :I have a file with 3236000 bytes and I want to read 2936000 from start and write to an OutputStreamInputStream is = new FileInputStream(file1);OutputStream os = new FileOutputStream(file2);AFunctionToCopy(is,os,0,2936000); /* a function or sourcecode to write input stream 0to2936000 bytes */I can read and write byte by byte, but it's to slow (i think) from buffered readingHow can do I copy it?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: InputStream is = new FileInputStream(file1);\nOutputStream os = new FileOutputStream(file2);\nint bytesRead = is.read(new byte[2936000]);\nos.write(bytesRead);\n<<<explanation>>>: The read() method of the InputStream class reads a single byte of data from the input stream and returns an integer value representing the number of bytes read. This method blocks until a byte is available or the end of the stream is reached. To read a large amount of data, it is recommended to use a BufferedInputStream and a BufferedOutputStream to read and write data in a buffered manner, which is faster than reading and writing byte by byte."}
