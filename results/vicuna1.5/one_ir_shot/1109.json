{"api": "StringTokenizer.nextToken", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Simple java file reader not working: :I am creating a program where two numbers are read from one file (test.in) and then the sum is output to another file (test.out). I created the two files as TXT documents in the bin folder of my project but it still gives this Exception in thread \"main\" java.io.FileNotFoundException: test.in.txt (The system cannot find the file specified)    at java.io.FileInputStream.open0(Native Method)    at java.io.FileInputStream.open(Unknown Source)    at java.io.FileInputStream.<init>(Unknown Source)    at java.io.FileInputStream.<init>(Unknown Source)    at java.io.FileReader.<init>(Unknown Source)    at test.main(test.java:11)The files are not showing up in my project directory on the left hand side of the screen, it just won't work.import java.io.*;import java.util.*;public class test {    public static void main (String [] args) throws IOException {        BufferedReader f = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"test.in.txt\"));        PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(\"test.out.txt\")));        StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(f.readLine());        int i1 = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());    // first integer        int i2 = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());    // second integer        out.println(i1+i2);                           // output result        out.close();                                  // close the output file      }}\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader f = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"test.in.txt\"));\nString line = f.readLine();\nint i1 = Integer.parseInt(line.split(\" \")[0]);\nint i2 = Integer.parseInt(line.split(\" \")[1]);\nPrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(\"test.out.txt\")));\nout.println(i1 + i2);\nout.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The StringTokenizer class is used to split a string into a sequence of tokens. The nextToken() method returns the next token in the sequence. The BufferedReader class is used to read the contents of a file, and the FileReader class is used to specify the file to be read. The PrintWriter class is used to write the output to a file, and the BufferedWriter class is used to specify the file to be written. The split() method is used to split a string into an array of tokens, and the parseInt() method is used to convert a string to an integer."}
