{"api": "StringTokenizer.nextToken", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Using the same indices between two arrays to get relevant information?: :I have a data reader that tokenizes input strings by given delimiters. The tokens go to an ArrayList, and the delimiters go to another. For example:this + is - an * inputThis sentence would be tokenized so that \"this\", \"is\", \"an\" and \"input\" would go to the token array while \"+\", \"-\" and \"*\" go to the delimiters array. Now, I need to store the original indices of these as well, so that the tokens would have indices 0, 2, 4 and 6 and the deliminators would have indices 1, 3 and 5. The normal solution would be to put them into the same array, but I need to keep them separated for performance reasons (e.g. to quickly check through the delimiters).How could this indexing be done so that when I have a token index 'i', I could easily get the deliminator from index 'i+1' without looping through all the delimiters?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String input = \"this + is - an * input\";\nString[] tokens = input.split(\"\\\\s+\");\nint[] delimiters = new int[tokens.length];\nfor (int i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {\ndelimiters[i] = tokens[i].indexOf(\"\\\\s+\");\n}\nint tokenIndex = 0;\nint delimiterIndex = 0;\nwhile (tokenIndex < tokens.length) {\nString token = tokens[tokenIndex++];\nint delimiterIndex = tokenIndex - 1;\nString delimiter = tokens[delimiterIndex];\nSystem.out.println(\"Token: \" + token + \", Delimiter: \" + delimiter);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The above code first splits the input string into tokens using the split() method and stores them in an array. Then, it uses a for loop to find the index of each delimiter in the token array. The index of the first token is set to -1, and the index of the second token is set to 0, and so on. The loop then uses the index of the current token to find the corresponding delimiter index and stores it in the delimiters array. Finally, the loop iterates through the tokens array and delimiters array to print the tokens and their corresponding delimiters."}
