USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Q re Java Programme to read from a text file, create an arraylist, reformat, and output to another file: :As a java student (beginner) I've just completed a task to write a program to perform the following tasks:Read the content of a text file;Pick out all words within the text, replacing all upper case letters with lower case ones;Produce a dictionary of the words appearing in the text (i.e., a list of the words in alphabetical order, one word per line, without duplication);Output the dictionary to another file.We were advised to have a single class containing our main method, and use the ArrayList, Scanner, PrintWriter and FileReader classes. I managed to do the below, which works, but it has raised some questions/fundamental gaps in my knowledge. I  believe that based on the principles of good O.O. programming practice, I should break the below down into a series of methods that have a single purpose, and then call those methods. However, I really struggle doing this. Can anyone please elaborate/advise a way to improve on that specific point? Or correct me if I'm wrong? public class Main{    private static ArrayList<String> dictionary;     private static ArrayList<String> tempdictionary;    public static void main() throws FileNotFoundException    {        Scanner inFile = new Scanner(new FileReader(\"H:\\\\csc8001\\\\results.txt\"));        dictionary = new ArrayList <>();        tempdictionary = new ArrayList <>();        while (inFile.hasNext()) {             dictionary.add(inFile.next().toLowerCase().replaceAll(\"[^a-zA-Z ]\", \"\"));        }        inFile.close();        PrintWriter outFile = new PrintWriter(\"H:\\\\csc8001\\\\results1.txt\");        int index = 0;        for (String a : dictionary)        {            if (!tempdictionary.contains(a)){                 tempdictionary.add(a);            } else {                index++;            }        }        Collections.sort(tempdictionary);        for (int i=0; i<tempdictionary.size(); i++)            outFile.println(tempdictionary.get(i));        outFile.flush();        outFile.close();    }}\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter outFile = new PrintWriter(\"H:\\\\csc8001\\\\results1.txt\");\noutFile.write(String.join(\"\\n\", tempdictionary));\noutFile.flush();\noutFile.close();\n\nExplanation: The write() method of the PrintWriter class is used to write the specified string to the output stream. In this case, we are joining the elements of the ArrayList tempdictionary with a newline character \"\\n\" and writing it to the output file \"H:\\\\csc8001\\\\results1.txt\". The flush() method is used to ensure that the output is written to the file immediately, and the close() method is used to close the PrintWriter."}
