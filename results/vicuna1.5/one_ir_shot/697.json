USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: I cant make the text file as read only mode in java: :package com.studytrails.tutorials.springremotingrmiserver;import java.lang.Object;import java.awt.Desktop;import java.io.*;import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;import org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext;import org.springframework.core.io.Resource;public class GreetingServiceImpl implements GreetingService {    @Override    public String getGreeting(String name) {        return \"Hello \" + name + \"!\";    }    public String getText() {        ApplicationContext appContext = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(new String[]{\"spring-config-server.xml\"});        Resource resource = appContext.getResource(\"file:D:\\\\text\\\\test.txt\");        StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();        try {            InputStream is = resource.getInputStream();            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(is));            File temp=File.createTempFile(\"output\", \".tmp\");            String filePath=temp.getAbsolutePath();            System.out.println(\"\"+filePath);            String tem=temp.getName();            String line;            PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(tem));            //System.out.println(\"\"+filePath);            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {                out.println(line);            }            temp.setReadOnly();            String[] cmd = {\"notepad\",tem};             Runtime runtime = Runtime.getRuntime();            Process proc = runtime.exec(cmd);            // proc.getInputStream();            out.close();            br.close();            //temp.deleteOnExit();            }        catch(IOException e) {            e.printStackTrace();        }        return builder.toString();    }}In above code I am not able to setReadonly(); command to temp file. File displayed with all options can you suggest how to make the temp file as not modified and even it is not able to save to another location. I need this file only displayed at run time of the program. During that time user does not change any content and it could not be save as  another location.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(tem));\nout.write(\"This is a test file.\");\nout.close();\n\nExplanation: The PrintWriter class is used to write text to a file. The write() method is used to write the text to the file. In this case, the text \"This is a test file.\" is written to the file. The close() method is used to close the PrintWriter and the FileWriter. This ensures that the file is properly closed and any resources used are released. By closing the file, the file will not be modified and will not be able to be saved as another location."}
