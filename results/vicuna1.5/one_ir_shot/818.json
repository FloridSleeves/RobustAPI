USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to write data to a String when in a for-loop: :So basically I have this database that is a for loop. It gives a different score every time, which I need to save to a String (or file, but I guess a string would be easier, because I need it to be empty at every new call for the database).I want to store all the scores by going through the loop, and then adding a , after each score (to keep them seperate) but my code isn't working because a part of the code is outside the for loop. How do I fix this? Or are there better/other methods to do what I want to create?DatabaseHandler db = new DatabaseHandler(camera.this);List<Database> contacts = db.getAllContacts();for (Database contact : contacts) {    String test = contact.getMP();    StringWriter stringWriter = new StringWriter();    PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(stringWriter);    printWriter.println(test);}  printWriter.flush();printWriter.close();return stringWriter.toString();\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(stringWriter);\nprintWriter.println(test);\nprintWriter.flush();\nprintWriter.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The PrintWriter class is used to write text to a character-output stream. The write() method of the PrintWriter class is used to write a string to the output stream. The flush() method is used to flush the output stream, which is necessary for the changes to be visible outside the current thread. The close() method is used to close the output stream."}
