The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Reading CSV file in Java: :Closed. This question needs to be more focused. It is not currently accepting answers.                                                            Want to improve this question?

Improve this question                    How to read the CSV file in Java?I assume I need to use an InputStream.How do I continue after the InputStream declaration?InputStream file = item.getInputStream();\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String line = \"\";\nwhile ((line = file.readLine()) != null) {\nString[] fields = line.split(\",\");\n// process each field\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The StringTokenizer class is used to split a string into tokens. The nextToken() method returns the next token in the string. The readLine() method reads the next line from the InputStream and returns it as a string. The split() method splits the string into an array of tokens based on the specified separator."}
