USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Java Image compression: :Closed. This question needs to be more focused. It is not currently accepting answers.                                                            Want to improve this question?

Improve this question                    From our application we fetch images (jpeg/png) from a third party service, after download we want to save these images as compressed.Can any one please guide how to compress images in Java ?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: Iterator<Image> iterator = imageList.iterator();\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\nImage image = iterator.next();\n// compress image\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The next() method of the Iterator interface returns the next element in the iteration order of the iterator. In this case, we are using an iterator for a list of images and calling the next() method to retrieve each image, then compressing the image."}
