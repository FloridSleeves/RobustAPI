USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: how to upload a file using commons file upload streaming api: :I am following the example provided in the commons file upload site about streaming API. I am stuck trying to figure out how to get the file extension of the uploaded file, how to write the file to a directory and the worst part is where the person who wrote the example comments // Process the input stream... It leaves me wondering if it's something so trivial that I'm the only one  who doesn't know how to. \nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"upload.txt\");\nwriter.write(\"filename.ext\");\nwriter.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The PrintWriter class is used to write text to a file. The write() method is used to write a string to the file. In this example, the file \"upload.txt\" is being created and the string \"filename.ext\" is being written to it. The close() method is used to close the writer and flush any buffered output."}
