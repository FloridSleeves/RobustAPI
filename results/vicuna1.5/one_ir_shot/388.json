{"api": "Iterator.next", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Manipulate an image without deleting its EXIF data: :Using imageIO, I usually have the problem of transforming an image file, and after overwriting it, it loses all of its EXIF data. Is there any way to preserve it without first extracting it, caching it, and then resetting it?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.util.Iterator\n<<<code>>>: Iterator iterator = imageIO.read(new File(\"image.jpg\"));\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\nint next = (int) iterator.next();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The next() method of the Iterator interface returns the next element in the iteration order of this iterator. This method returns an object of the type T, which is the type of the elements held in the iterator. The hasNext() method returns true if this iterator has at least one more element."}
