Improve this question                    I have stored some JSON objects in MongoDB collections and using Mongo jar and Java I did full text search, and I am extracting one of my DB fields using below code:String tags2=dbo.getString(\"Tags\");Result:[[\"pdf\",\"java\",\"c++\"][\"perl\",\"pdf\",\"c\"][\"java\",\"c++\"]]My requirement is to split all the words and remove duplicates. I require the following output:pdfjavac++cperlCan you please suggest a way to get this?\nPlease using this api: JsonElement.getAsString.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: JsonElement.getAsString\n<<<code>>>: String tags2 = dbo.getString(\"Tags\");\nJsonElement jsonElement = new JsonParser().parse(tags2).getAsJsonObject().getAsJsonArray(\"tags\");\nList<String> tagsList = jsonElement.getAsListOfStrings();\ntagsList.removeIf(String::isBlank);\ntagsList.addAll(tagsList.stream().flatMap(Collection::stream).distinct().collect(Collectors.toList()));\n<<<explanation>>>: First, we extract the \"tags\" field from the MongoDB document using the getString method. Then, we parse the \"tags\" field as a JSON array using the JsonParser class. Next, we get the list of strings from the JSON array using the getAsListOfStrings method. We remove any blank strings from the list using the isBlank method and add back the unique strings using the distinct method. Finally, we collect the unique strings into a list using the collect method and the flatMap method."}
