{"api": "InputStream.read", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Getting a HTTP POST binary payload to a byte array in Scala: :I have a socket which will persist for long. Client will keep streaming data requests to my server app through the socket. Request is a POST with a binary payload which needs to be copied to a byte array which i need to use to get the protocol buffer class.POST / HTTP/1.1Host: 127.0.0.1:80Accept-Encoding: identityContent-Length: 423Content-type: application/octet-stream[PAYLOAD]val out = new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream())val in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()))Any ideas ? UPDATE - I got a temporary solution using a DEPRECATED java function - DataInputStream.readLine.Can someone make this code better ?val in = new DataInputStream(socket.getInputStream())var n:Int = 0var size:Int=0while (n==0) {    var str=in.readLine    if(str==\"\"){        n =1    }else{        val breaks=str.split(\" \")        if(breaks(0).equals(\"Content-Length:\"))size=breaks(1).toInt    }}var payload:Array[Byte]=new Array(size)n=size-1for(i <- 0 to n) payload(i)=in.readByte\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: val in = new DataInputStream(socket.getInputStream())\nval payload = new Array[Byte](size)\nfor (i <- 0 until size) {\npayload(i) = in.readByte()\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The readByte() method of the DataInputStream class reads a single byte of data from the input stream and returns it as an integer. This can be used to read the binary payload of a POST request. The size of the payload can be determined by reading the \"Content-Length\" header and using it to create an Array of the appropriate size."}
