USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Inject Context (CDI/servlet) into new FutureTask Thread: :I found that a new thread created in the servlet donot contain the servlet/CDI context. I created a HelloWorld servlet (given below) to experiment with this problem. In the below example, you'll see that I am running 'doIt()' function in a new Thread (FutureTask). But it returns NULL but when I call 'doIt()' method directly, BeanManager is not NULL./** * Servlet implementation class HelloWorld */@WebServlet(\"/HelloWorld\")public class HelloWorld extends HttpServlet {    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;    private static Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(HelloWorld.class            .getName());    /**     * @see HttpServlet#doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)     */    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {        PrintWriter writer = response.getWriter();        writer.println(\"<html>\");        writer.println(\"<head><title>Hello World Servlet</title></head>\");        writer.println(\"<body>\");        writer.println(\"<h1>Context injection into Thread Experiment</h1>\");        try {            // 1. This is NOT working            new Thread(testTask).start();            testTask.get(5000, TimeUnit.SECONDS);            // 2. This is working                //doIt();        } catch (Exception e) {            e.printStackTrace();        }        writer.println(\"<body>\");        writer.println(\"</html>\");        writer.close();             }    Runnable runnable = new Runnable() {        @Override        public void run() {            try {                doIt();            } catch (Exception e) {                e.printStackTrace();            }        }    };    FutureTask<Object> testTask = new FutureTask<Object>(runnable, null);    protected void doIt() throws Exception {        if(getBeanManager() == null) {             throw new Exception( \"BEAN MANAGER IS NULL\");         }    }    public static BeanManager getBeanManager() {        try {            InitialContext initialContext = new InitialContext();            return (BeanManager) initialContext.lookup(\"java:comp/BeanManager\");        } catch (NamingException e) {            logger.info(\"Couldn't get BeanManager through JNDI\");            return null;        }    }}I searched online but could not find a good reference than saying it is possible. It would be great, if anybody can help me or provide me with some good pointers to inject/pass context into the new thread.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter writer = response.getWriter();\nwriter.println(\"<html>\");\nwriter.println(\"<head><title>Hello World Servlet</title></head>\");\nwriter.println(\"<body>\");\nwriter.println(\"<h1>Context injection into Thread Experiment</h1>\");\nwriter.println(\"</body>\");\nwriter.println(\"</html>\");\nwriter.close();\n\nExplanation:\nThe PrintWriter class is used to write text to a response object in a servlet. In this code, the response object is obtained from the HttpServletResponse parameter passed to the doGet() method. The PrintWriter object is then used to write HTML code to the response, which is displayed in the browser. The doIt() method is called within the run() method of the Runnable object passed to the FutureTask object. The BeanManager object is obtained using the getBeanManager() method and is passed to the Runnable object. However, since the new thread created in the doGet() method does not have access to the servlet's CDI context, the BeanManager object is null when the doIt() method is called."}
