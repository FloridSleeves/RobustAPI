{"api": "RandomAccessFile.write", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Update data to file each amount of bytes: :I want to write my content data to a file each 10kb of file. It looks like this: What I tried: FileInputStream is; FileOutputStream out; File input = new File(filePath); int fileLength = input.length(); int len = 0;    while (len < fileLength){        len += is.read(buff);        // write my data        out.write(data, 0, data.length);       // how to move is to read next 10kb???    }I wonder is there anyway to move the cursor reader to next amount of bytes? Or do I miss anything?Update:Thank to @DThought, here is my implementation:    File input = new File(filePath);    long fileLength = input.length();    byte[] data;    byte[] buff = new byte[data.length];    long JUMP_LENGTH = 10 * 1024;    RandomAccessFile raf = new RandomAccessFile(input, \"rw\");    long step = JUMP_LENGTH + data.length;    for (long i = 0; i < fileLength; i += step) {        // read to buffer        raf.seek(i);        raf.read(buff);        raf.seek(i); // make sure it move to correct place after reading        raf.write(data);    }    raf.close();And it worked well.\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: RandomAccessFile.write\n<<<code>>>: RandomAccessFile raf = new RandomAccessFile(filePath, \"rw\");\nlong step = JUMP\\_LENGTH + data.length;\nfor (long i = 0; i < fileLength; i += step) {\nraf.seek(i);\nraf.write(data);\nraf.seek(i + JUMP\\_LENGTH);\n}\nraf.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The write() method of the RandomAccessFile class writes a sequence of bytes to the file at the current position of the file pointer. The seek() method is used to move the file pointer to the desired position before writing. The step variable is used to calculate the amount of bytes to read and write in each iteration."}
