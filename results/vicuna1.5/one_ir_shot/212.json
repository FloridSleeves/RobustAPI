{"api": "InputStream.read", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Any byte >= 128 is received as 65533: :I am implementing a server on Android and I am using:while (!Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) {    try {        int r;        String response = \"\";        while ((r = input.read()) > 0) {        ...        }    ...}I have two issues. If the client sends me a byte of value 0, it is not received by the server. The second issue is, if the byte value is 128 or more, I keep receiving a value of 65533 or a binary value of 11111101. Anyone knows how to solve these issues. I am a beginner in networking on JAVA.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: int r;\nwhile ((r = input.read()) > 0) {\n...\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The read() method of the InputStream class reads a single byte of data from the input stream into an byte variable. If the byte is not available, the method will block until a byte is available. If the byte value is 0, it will be interpreted as -1, and if the byte value is 128 or more, it will be interpreted as 65533. This is because the range of values that can be represented by a byte is 0 to 255, and any value outside of this range will be interpreted as the maximum value of 255. To fix the first issue, you can check if the byte value is 0 before using it. To fix the second issue, you can use the byte value as is, and check if it is within the valid range of values for a byte."}
