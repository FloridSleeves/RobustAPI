{"api": "DataOutputStream.write", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to send data to the same application installed on other android device using wifi: :i have an application on my android device like \"A\" and same application installed on the other android device like \"B\", now i want to send data from app \"A\" to app \"B\" using WIFI service. so please suggest me how can i implement this feature.i tried many times to get help from google but all is vain.it is possible from WIFI direct or NFC.\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: DataOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>: DataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(\"data.bin\"));\ndos.writeInt(1);\ndos.writeInt(2);\ndos.writeInt(3);\ndos.writeInt(4);\ndos.writeInt(5);\ndos.close();\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The DataOutputStream class is used to write binary data to a file. The writeInt() method is used to write an integer value to the file. In this example, we are writing the integer values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 to a file named \"data.bin\". The FileOutputStream class is used to write the data to a file. The close() method is used to close the output stream."}
