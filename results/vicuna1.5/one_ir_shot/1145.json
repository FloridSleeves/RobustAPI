{"api": "StringTokenizer.nextToken", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Spliting a text using json parser in java: :I have few lines of strings in my property file i need to import it and split those lines and use it the way i want Example format of my property file007.customerclass = component:keyboard;determinantType:key;determinant:test;waste008.ReasonClass = component:mouse;determinantType:click;determinant:rest;RClassI need to split the entire 007 line and 008 into 4 different parts .Expected output : keyboard key test waste and mouse click rest RClassI have achieved this using split but i want to achieve it using jsonparser to minimize my codeThank you\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String propertyFile = \"007.customerclass = component:keyboard;determinantType:key;determinant:test;waste008.ReasonClass = component:mouse;determinantType:click;determinant:rest;RClass\";\nString[] lines = propertyFile.split(\"\\\\n\");\nString[] parts = lines[0].split(\"\\\\s+\");\nfor (int i = 0; i < parts.length; i++) {\nSystem.out.println(parts[i]);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The StringTokenizer class is used to split a string into tokens. The nextToken() method returns the next token in the string. This is a non-terminal operation."}
