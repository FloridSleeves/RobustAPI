{"api": "InputStream.read", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How do I read / convert an InputStream into a String in Java?: :If you have a java.io.InputStream object, how should you process that object and produce a String?Suppose I have an InputStream that contains text data, and I want to convert it to a String, so for example I can write that to a log file.What is the easiest way to take the InputStream and convert it to a String?public String convertStreamToString(InputStream is) {// ???}\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.io.InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: public String convertStreamToString(InputStream is) {\nInputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(is);\nBufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);\nStringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\nString line = null;\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\nsb.append(line);\n}\nString result = sb.toString();\nreturn result;\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The readLine() method of the BufferedReader class reads a line of text from the input stream and returns it as a string. The StringBuilder class is used to accumulate the lines of text read from the input stream and the result is returned as a string."}
