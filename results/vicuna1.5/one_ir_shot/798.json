This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: write the console output to a text file using jsoup: :I wanted to write the console output to a text file but somehow it only writes one line to my text file. I am new  to Java. I don't understand the p in the code, so please help me. Here is my code :package htmlparser;import java.io.IOException;import java.util.logging.*;    import org.jsoup.*;import org.jsoup.nodes.*;import org.jsoup.select.*;    import java.io.FileWriter;import java.io.PrintWriter;import java.io.File;import java.io.*;public class Htmlparser {  public static void main(String[] args)  {    try {      String url = \"http://cell-phone-providers-review.toptenreviews.com/cingular-review.html\";      Document doc = Jsoup.connect(url).get();      Elements paragraphs = doc.select(\"p\");      for(Element p : paragraphs)        System.out.println(p.text());      PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(\"C:/Users/Desktop/outputtext.txt\"));       out.print(System.in);       out.close();              }     catch (IOException ex) {      Logger.getLogger(Htmlparser.class.getName())            .log(Level.SEVERE, null, ex);    }  }}\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(\"C:/Users/Desktop/outputtext.txt\"));\nout.print(System.in);\nout.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The PrintWriter class is used to write text to a file. The write() method of the PrintWriter class is used to write the text to the file. The first argument is the file to which the text is to be written and the second argument is the text to be written. In this code, the System.in is used to get the console output and it is being written to the file \"C:/Users/Desktop/outputtext.txt\". The close() method is used to close the file writer."}
