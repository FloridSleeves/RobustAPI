{"api": "DataOutputStream.write", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Can I change the type of stream I'm using without closing and reopening the socket in Java?: :I'm doing some socket programming in Java and I'd like to be able to change between using the ObjectOutputStream, the DataOutputStream, and the PrintWriter all within the same socket/connection.  Is this possible and what is the best way to do it?I've tried just creating both types of objects, for example ObjectOutputStream and DataOutputStream, but that doesn't seem to work.The reason I want to switch between them is to, for example, send a text command \"INFO\" that signals I'm about to send an object with information or a command \"DATA\" signalling that I'm about to send data.  Any advice on the best way to do this is appreciated.\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: DataOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>: DataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(socket);\ndos.writeUTF(\"INFO\");\ndos.writeObject(object);\ndos.writeUTF(\"DATA\");\n<<<explanation>>>: You can switch between using ObjectOutputStream and DataOutputStream within the same socket/connection by creating both objects and using the writeUTF() method to write the desired message. The writeObject() method can then be used to write the object. The writeUTF() method is used to write the text command \"INFO\" and \"DATA\" to signal the type of data being sent."}
