{"api": "Iterator.next", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to emit a comma-separated list?: :This is profoundly simple, yet I've seen many variants, and I don't see my own practice much elsewhere.  Given:Iterable<String> strings;create a String containing all the strings, separated by commas.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: Iterable<String> strings = Arrays.asList(\"foo\", \"bar\", \"baz\");\nString commaSeparatedList = strings.iterator().next();\n<<<explanation>>>: The iterator().next() method returns the next element in the iterator, or null if the iterator is exhausted. In this case, we are using it to return the first element of the Iterable, which is then separated by commas to create the comma-separated list."}
