USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to append to AES encrypted file: :I'm writing some kind of logger that produces encrypted log-file. Unfortunately, cryptography is not my strong side. Now I can write to file several messages and then close file. Then i can open it, append some messages, close again and after decryption I see padding bytes in the middle of file. Is there any way to work with encrypted file without having to decrypt it every time I want to append some messages?EDIT: little more details. Current implementation utlizes CipherOutputStream. As i understand there's no way to seek using it.Can i use 'NoPadding' option if i will control that output data size is divisible by block size?\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: RandomAccessFile.write\n<<<code>>>: RandomAccessFile file = new RandomAccessFile(\"encrypted_file.log\", \"rw\");\nfile.setEncoding(\"UTF-8\");\nint paddingLength = 16; // assume the padding length is 16 bytes\nint blockSize = 16; // assume the block size is 16 bytes\nint dataSize = file.length() - paddingLength; // get the size of unpadded data\nint paddingSize = (dataSize + blockSize - 1) / blockSize * blockSize; // calculate the size of padding\nfile.seek(paddingSize); // seek to the beginning of the padding\nfile.write(new byte[paddingSize]); // write the padding bytes\nfile.seek(dataSize); // seek to the beginning of the unpadded data\nfor (int i = 0; i < messages.length; i++) {\nfile.write(messages[i]); // write each message to the file\n}\nfile.close();\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn this implementation, we first open the encrypted file using RandomAccessFile.write. We then calculate the size of the padding required based on the block size and the size of the unpadded data. We seek to the beginning of the padding and write the padding bytes using RandomAccessFile.write. We then seek to the beginning of the unpadded data and write each message to the file using RandomAccessFile.write. Finally, we close the file.\n\nBy seeking to the beginning of the padding and writing the padding bytes, we ensure that the file is properly padded and can be decrypted without issues. Since we are controlling the output data size and the block size, we can use the 'NoPadding' option to avoid padding bytes in the middle of the file."}
