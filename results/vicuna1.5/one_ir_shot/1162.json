{"api": "StringTokenizer.nextToken", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: StringTokennizer, take only the last 3 elements out of 4: :I need some help to figure this problem i have run into. Have read a txt file with a buffer reader and trying to use a StringTokenizer.The string i have it like this, where some text first and some numbers after. I only need to numbers, and want to skip \"Text\".Test 2 5 1My code:// Check if the graph contains an cycle    StringTokenizer st1 = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());    Graph.checkForCycle(null, Integer.parseInt(st1.()), Integer.parseInt(st1.nextToken()), Integer.parseInt(st1.nextToken()));      As you can see there are 4 sets here and i want the last 3 to be send with the paramenter when i call the method Graph.checkForCycle()Hope someone can help.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: StringTokenizer st1 = new StringTokenizer(\"Test 2 5 1\");\nString lastThree = st1.nextToken();\nlastThree += st1.nextToken();\nlastThree += st1.nextToken();\nGraph.checkForCycle(null, Integer.parseInt(lastThree.trim()), Integer.parseInt(st1.nextToken()), Integer.parseInt(st1.nextToken()));\n<<<explanation>>>: The nextToken() method of the StringTokenizer class returns the next token in the string. This method returns the next non-whitespace character in the string. To get the last three tokens, you can use the nextToken() method three times, and then concatenate the results. The trim() method can be used to remove any whitespace from the end of the string."}
