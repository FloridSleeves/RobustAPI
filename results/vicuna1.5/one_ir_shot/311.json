{"api": "Iterator.next", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Java get image extension/type using BufferedImage from URL: :I am familiar with working with images. I retrieve/read an image from a URL, where the URL does not have a file extension. Then I wish to write/save the image to the local storage, but I have to specify the image file extension (i.e. JPG, PNG, etc.), which I cannot retrieve its extension through the BufferedImage.Could one please point out how it can be done?Any other method will do.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: BufferedImage image = ImageIO.read(new URL(\"https://example.com/image.jpg\"));\nString extension = image.getType().getName();\n<<<explanation>>>: The getType() method of the BufferedImage class returns the type of the image data, which is a subclass of the ImageType class. The ImageType class has a static field named NAME that returns the file extension of the image. So, we can use the getType().getName() method to get the file extension of the image."}
