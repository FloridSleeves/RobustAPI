This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Android list applications that can view an unknown file: :Hi I'm working on an app where I need to list all types of applications able to open a file. If the file were an image I would do something like this normally to show all applications capable of viewing the image.Intent intent = new Intent();intent.setAction(android.content.Intent.ACTION_VIEW);intent.setDataAndType(Uri.fromFile(file), \"image/*\");context.startActivity(intent);However say I have an unknown file how could I list all applications able to view a file so the user can select the appropriate application to open the file in my application.I also need the titles listed in an arraylist if possible so I can list them in a listview. Thank you for any help with getting a list of applications capable of viewing a file===================================EditAlright well something easier how can i get the applications from the above intent into an arraylist i could just do image/* audio/* etc and add them all to a list and then list them in a listview and that would solve my problem\nPlease using this api: ApplicationInfo.loadIcon.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: ApplicationInfo.loadIcon\n<<<code>>>: PackageManager packageManager = getPackageManager();\nList<ApplicationInfo> apps = packageManager.getInstalledApplications(0);\nArrayList<String> appTitles = new ArrayList<>();\nfor (ApplicationInfo app : apps) {\nString packageName = app.packageName;\nIntent intent = new Intent();\nintent.setAction(Intent.ACTION_MAIN);\nintent.addCategory(Intent.CATEGORY_APP);\nintent.setPackage(packageName);\nPackageManager pm = getPackageManager();\nList<ResolveInfo> list = pm.queryIntentActivities(intent, 0);\nfor (ResolveInfo ri : list) {\nString activityName = ri.activityInfo.name;\nif (activityName != null) {\nappTitles.add(activityName);\n}\n}\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: This code gets all the installed applications on the device, then iterates through each one to get the package name and the title of the application. It then creates an Intent with the package name and sets it to action ACTION\\_MAIN and category ACTION\\_APP. It then uses the PackageManager to query the intent activities and get the title of the application. The titles are then added to an ArrayList which is used to populate a ListView."}
