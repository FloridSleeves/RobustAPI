This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: using for loop write lines one by one in file using java: :                                It's difficult to tell what is being asked here.

The write() method of the PrintWriter class is used to write a string to the file. The close() method is used to close the PrintWriter and the FileWriter."}
