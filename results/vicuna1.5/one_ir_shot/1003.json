USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Understanding piece of code written in PHP using Zend framework: :I am java developer and I am trying to use one WEB Service API (ticketutils) where they have explained two examples first one with PHP and second one with C#. Unfortunately I am not able to get any of them. I have mentioned PHP example below.  public function GenerateSignature($Secret,$PathAndQuery)     {       return base64_encode(\\Zend_Crypt_Hmac::compute($Secret, 'sha256',       $PathAndQuery, \\Zend_Crypt_Hmac::BINARY));     }Can anyone please explain me how can I achieve the same with Java code? I have tried below code but it seems it's not generating proper outcome. public static String generateSignature(String secrete, String pathAndQuery){        String encoded = null;        try {            MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\");            md.update(secrete.getBytes(\"UTF-8\"));            md.update(pathAndQuery.getBytes(\"UTF-8\"));            byte[] digest = md.digest();            encoded = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(digest);        } catch (Exception e) {            e.printStackTrace();        }        return encoded;    }NOTE : I have used Java-8 for while writing above code. \nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: String.getBytes\n<<<code>>>: String secrete = \"mysecret\";\nString pathAndQuery = \"http://example.com/path?query=value\";\nbyte[] digest = md.digest();\nString encoded = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(digest);\n<<<explanation>>>: The getBytes() method of the String class returns an array of bytes for the specified character set. In this case, we are using the UTF-8 character set. The digest() method of the MessageDigest class returns a byte array containing the hash of the input message. The Base64 class is used to encode the digest to a string."}
