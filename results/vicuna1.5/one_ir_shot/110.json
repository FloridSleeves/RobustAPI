{"api": "DataOutputStream.write", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Convert InputStream to byte array in Java: :How do I read an entire InputStream into a byte array?\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: DataOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>: InputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream(\"file.txt\");\nbyte[] byteArray = new byte[inputStream.available()];\nDataOutputStream dataOutputStream = new DataOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(\"file.txt\"));\ndataOutputStream.write(inputStream);\ndataOutputStream.close();\ninputStream.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The write() method of the DataOutputStream class writes the contents of the specified input stream to the current output stream. This method is used to write the entire InputStream into a byte array."}
