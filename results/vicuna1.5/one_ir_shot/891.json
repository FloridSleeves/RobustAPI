USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: getting data from a cursor: :After running a query cursor hold data like this one1 - R. Robert 1 - F. Ahmed 2 - M. Rahman 2 - T. Banik 3 - L. MorisonI want to get the data by specific id Like 1 and wnat to store it in an Array. I tried with this oneString [] Names = null;        cursor.moveToFirst();        do{            if(cursor.getString(cursor.getColumnIndexOrThrow(\"_id\")).equalsIgnoreCase(\"1\")){                String namesAuth = cursor.getString(cursor.getColumnIndexOrThrow(\"NAME\"));                Names[cursor.getInt(cursor.getColumnIndexOrThrow(\"_id\"))] = namesAuth;            }      }while(cursor.moveToNext());I want a format like this one [R.Robert,F.Ahmed]. is this possible ? Thank you\nPlease using this api: SQLiteDatabase.query.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: SQLiteDatabase.query\n<<<code>>>: String [] Names = null;\nString selection = \"_id=?\";\nString[] selectionArgs = new String[]{\"1\"};\nCursor cursor = db.query(DatabaseHelper.TABLE_NAME, null, selection, selectionArgs, null, null, null);\nwhile (cursor.moveToNext()) {\nString namesAuth = cursor.getString(cursor.getColumnIndex(DatabaseHelper.COLUMN_NAME));\nNames[cursor.getInt(cursor.getColumnIndex(DatabaseHelper.COLUMN_ID))] = namesAuth;\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The query() method of the SQLiteDatabase class is used to execute a SELECT statement on the database. It returns a Cursor object that contains the results of the query. In this case, the query is selecting the values of the NAME and ID columns where the ID is equal to 1. The selectionArgs array contains the value 1 to pass as a parameter to the selection clause. The getColumnIndex() method is used to get the index of the column in the cursor.
