USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Java 8 Stream, getting head and tail: :Java 8 introduced a Stream class that resembles Scala's Stream, a powerful lazy construct using which it is possible to do something like this very concisely:def from(n: Int): Stream[Int] = n #:: from(n+1)def sieve(s: Stream[Int]): Stream[Int] = {  s.head #:: sieve(s.tail filter (_ % s.head != 0))}val primes = sieve(from(2))primes takeWhile(_ < 1000) print  // prints all primes less than 1000I wondered if it is possible to do this in Java 8, so I wrote something like this:IntStream from(int n) {    return IntStream.iterate(n, m -> m + 1);}IntStream sieve(IntStream s) {    int head = s.findFirst().getAsInt();    return IntStream.concat(IntStream.of(head), sieve(s.skip(1).filter(n -> n % head != 0)));}IntStream primes = sieve(from(2));Fairly simple, but it produces java.lang.IllegalStateException: stream has already been operated upon or closed because both findFirst() and skip() are terminal operations on Stream which can be done only once.I don't really have to use up the stream twice since all I need is the first number in the stream and the rest as another stream, i.e. equivalent of Scala's Stream.head and Stream.tail. Is there a method in Java 8 Stream that I can use to achieve this?Thanks.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: IntStream sieve = IntStream.iterate(2, n -> n + 1);\nsieve = sieve.skip(1).filter(n -> n % sieve.next() != 0);\nIntStream primes = sieve.skip(1);\n<<<explanation>>>: The skip() method of the IntStream class skips the first n elements of this stream and returns a new stream with the remaining elements. The filter() method of the IntStream class removes elements from this stream that do not match the given predicate. The next() method of the Iterator class returns the next element in the iterator. This is a terminal operation."}
