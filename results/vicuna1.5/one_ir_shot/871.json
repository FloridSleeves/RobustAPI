USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: What is the best way to use a single instance of SQLiteOpenHelper among two different activities?: :I'm coding for the first time in Android (Java) an application using a sqlite database. Two activities must save some informations so I use in both a MySQLiteHelper to access the database.I read here that building SQLiteOpenHelper as static data member could be a good practice so I did this. The static factory method ensures that there exists only one DatabaseHelper instance at any time.I create in each activity a SQLiteOpenHelper that uses the method getWritableDatabase() but I don't know where to use the close() method. Should I put this method after every modification or once at the end of the activity ? Thank you =)\nPlease using this api: SQLiteDatabase.query.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: SQLiteDatabase.query\n<<<code>>>: SQLiteDatabase db = getWritableDatabase();\nCursor cursor = db.query(/* table name */, /* columns */, /* selection */, /* selection arguments */, /* group by */, /* having */, /* order by */);\ncursor.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The close() method should be called once at the end of the activity to close the database connection and release any system resources. It is not necessary to call it after every modification, as the database connection will be automatically closed when the activity is destroyed."}
