{"api": "DataOutputStream.write", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Write and read multiple byte[] in file with Java: :I have to write byte arrays in a file. I can't do it in one time so I can't put my arrays in a container. Also the size of my arrays is variable.Secondly, the file is very huge, so I have to split it, in order to read it array by array.How can I do that ? I tried to write line by line my byte arrays  but I haven't been able. How can I put a separator between my arrays and after split it over this separator ?EDIT : I tried this :ByteArrayOutputStream bos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();ObjectOutput out = new ObjectOutputStream(bos);out.writeObject(byteArray);But, I execute this code several times, so the ObjectOutputStream adds each time a new header which corrupt the file.I also try : out.write(byteArray);but I couldn't separate my arrays. So I tried to append a '\\n', which didn't work. After I was looking for library like FileUtils in order to write byte[] line by line but I didn't find.\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: DataOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>: DataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(\"file.txt\"));\ndos.write(byteArray);\ndos.close();\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The DataOutputStream class provides methods for writing binary data to a file. The write() method of the DataOutputStream class writes a single byte of data to the file. This method does not add any additional headers, so it is suitable for writing multiple byte arrays to a file without corrupting the data. The close() method is used to close the file output stream, which is important for releasing resources."}
