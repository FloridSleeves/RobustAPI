{"api": "InputStream.read", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to parse multiple, consecutive xml files in one document?: :I have a big text file that is a sequence of XML-valid documents that looks something like this:<DOC>   <TEXT> ... </TEXT>    ...</DOC><DOC>    <TEXT> ... </TEXT>    ...</DOC>etc. There is no <?xml version=\"1.0\">, the <DOC></DOC> delimits each separate xml. What's the best way to parse this in Java and get the values under <TEXT> in each <DOC>?If I pass the whole thing to a DocumentBuilder, I get an error saying the document is not well formed. Is there a better solution than simply traversing through, a building a string for each <DOC>?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.io.InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: String text = \"\";\nint c = 0;\nwhile ((c = inputStream.read()) != -1) {\nStringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\nfor (int i = 0; i < c; i++) {\nsb.append((char) inputStream.read());\n}\ntext += sb.toString();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: This code reads characters from an input stream one by one and concatenates them into a string. The while loop continues to read characters until it reaches the end of the stream (-1). The StringBuilder is used to avoid creating too many string objects."}
