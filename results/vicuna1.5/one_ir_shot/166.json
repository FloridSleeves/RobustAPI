USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I display a bitmap image in a Java applet?: :I am having a hard time figuring out how to show an Image (or ImageIcon) in a Java applet. The following is my code.  The picture (test.bmp) does exist and is on the D drive but when I run this I get the applet window with nothing in it.  Can somebody tell me what I am missing to make the ImageIcon show?public class Form1 extends JApplet {    ImageIcon i;    public void init(){        i = new ImageIcon(\"D:\\test.bmp\");    }    public void paint(Graphics g){        i.paintIcon(this, g, 0, 0);    }}Thanks, Steve.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.io.InputStream\n<<<code>>>: Image i = new Image(\"D:\\test.bmp\");\nImageIcon ii = new ImageIcon(i);\n<<<explanation>>>: The code creates an Image object by specifying the file path of the image, and then creates an ImageIcon object by passing the Image object to its constructor. The ImageIcon object is then used to paint the image on the applet's canvas using the paintIcon() method."}
