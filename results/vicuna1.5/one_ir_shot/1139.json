{"api": "StringTokenizer.nextToken", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to get substring based on special characters in android?: :Actually this is a very simple question, I tried a lot but I am unable to get the exact solution. I have a string like:String mystring = \"one<1234567>,two<98765432>,three<878897656>\";Here I want the data which is inside \"<\" and \">\". Can anyone help me with this?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String mystring = \"one<1234567>,two<98765432>,three<878897656>\";\nString[] tokens = mystring.split(\"\\\\<.*\\\\>\");\nString result = tokens[0].trim();\n<<<explanation>>>: The StringTokenizer class is used to split a string into tokens. The nextToken() method returns the next token in the string. In this case, we are using the split() method with a regular expression to split the string based on the \"<\" and \">\" characters. The resulting array is then accessed to get the desired substring."}
