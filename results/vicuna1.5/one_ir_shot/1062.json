{"api": "StringTokenizer.nextToken", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Java file read problem: :I have a java problem. I am trying  to read a txt file which has a variable number of integers per line, and for each line I need to sum every second integer! I am using scanner to read integers, but can't work out when a line is done. Can anyone help pls?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String line = \"\";\nint sum = 0;\nwhile ((line = scanner.nextLine()) != null) {\nString[] tokens = line.split(\"\\\\s+\");\nfor (int i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {\nif (i % 2 == 0) {\nsum += Integer.parseInt(tokens[i]);\n}\n}\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The StringTokenizer class is used to split a string into tokens. The nextToken() method returns the next token in the stream. The split() method splits a string into an array of substrings based on a specified separator. In this case, the line is split on whitespace characters. The for loop iterates through the tokens and adds every second integer to the sum."}
