{"api": "String.getBytes", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Library for generating HMAC-SHA1 OAuth signature on Android?: :Using the specifications below I need to create an oauth_signature on Android.  I'm looking for a library that handles the boiler plate code in creating a signature for accessing resources via OAuth.Construct a signature \"base string\", which consists of a concatenation of three request elements:The HTTP request method.The base URL the request is being sent to. This URL should not include any query parameters. When signing calls to Google services, refer to the OAuth specification, Section 9.1.2, for relevant instructions.A normalized string of the parameters in the request (excluding the oauth_signature parameter). This includes parameters sent in the request header or body, as well as query parameters added to the request URL. To normalize the string, sort the parameters using lexicographical byte value ordering. For more details on normalizing this string, see Section 9.1.1 of the OAuth specification.Generate an oauth_signature using one of the following sequences:If your application is registered and you're using HMAC-SHA1, use the OAuth \"consumer secret\" value generated during registration; this value is displayed on your domain's registration page.\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: String.getBytes\n<<<code>>>: String baseString = \"GET&https://example.com&param1=value1&param2=value2\";\nbyte[] bytes = baseString.getBytes();\nString oauthSignature = new HmacSha1Signature(bytes).getSignature();\n<<<explanation>>>: The getBytes() method of the String class converts the specified string to an array of bytes. This is used to convert the base string into a byte array that can be used for signing. The HmacSha1Signature class is a library that generates an HMAC-SHA1 OAuth signature based on the provided consumer secret and the byte array of the request elements."}
