{"api": "RandomAccessFile.read", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Read file and split into multiple files: :I have a file which I would like to read in Java and split this file into n (user input) output files. Here is how I read the file:int n = 4;BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"file.csv\"));try {    String line = br.readLine();    while (line != null) {        line = br.readLine();    }} finally {    br.close();}How do I split the file - file.csv into n files?Note - Since the number of entries in the file are of the order of 100k, I can't store the file content into an array and then split it and save into multiple files.\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: RandomAccessFile.read\n<<<code>>>: RandomAccessFile file = new RandomAccessFile(\"file.csv\", \"r\");\nint n = 4;\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\nString line = file.readLine();\n// do something with line\n}\nfile.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The readLine() method of the RandomAccessFile class reads a line from the file and returns it as a string. The for loop iterates n times, and on each iteration, the line is read from the file and stored in the variable line. The file is then closed using the close() method."}
