USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to Create InputStream Object from JsonObject: :I'm trying to figure out how one goes about retrieving the raw bytes stored in a JsonObject and turns that into an InputStream object?I figured it might be something like:InputStream fis = new FileInputStream((File)json.getJsonObject(\"data\"));Granted I haven't tried that out, but just wanted to know if anyone had any experience with this and knew the preferred way to do it?\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: String.getBytes\n<<<code>>>: JsonObject json = new JsonObject(\"{\\\"data\\\": \\\"Hello, World!\\\"}\");\nbyte[] bytes = json.getBytes(\"data\");\nInputStream fis = new ByteArrayInputStream(bytes);\n<<<explanation>>>: The getBytes() method of the JsonObject class returns a byte array representation of the JSON string stored in this object. The ByteArrayInputStream class is used to create an InputStream object from a byte array."}
