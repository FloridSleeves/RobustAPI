{"api": "StringTokenizer.nextToken", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: code compiles but i get NoSuchElementException error: :This program is suppose to take a people name,sex and number of people have that name and separate name in a String , sex into a char, and number of people with the name into a int. The number of people that have the name is already calculated I just need to separate each into right categories.Problem is the code compiles but I get an NoSuchElementException error.File looks like this:John,M,416Sarah,F,414Mike,M,413Kate,F,413    ArrayList<OneName> oneName = new ArrayList<OneName>();    while(sc.hasNextLine())    {    // read a line from the input file via sc into line        line = sc.nextLine();        String[] fields =line.split(\",\");        StringTokenizer stk = new StringTokenizer(line);        String name = stk.nextToken();        char sex = stk.nextToken().charAt(0);        int count = Integer.parseInt(stk.nextToken());        OneName list = new OneName(name, sex, count);        oneName.add(list);          }   String personSex = oneName.get(0).getName();    System.out.println(personSex);    }\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String name = StringTokenizer.nextToken(line);\n<<<explanation>>>: The nextToken() method of the StringTokenizer class returns the next token in the input string. This method returns the next token in the input string, or null if the end of the input has been reached. In this case, it is being used to extract the name from the input line."}
