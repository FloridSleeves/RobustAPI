{"api": "StringTokenizer.nextToken", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Create a string array with length determined by user input: :I am trying to create an array that reads string tokens from standard input, and places them in an array, and then prints the words out, until it reaches a specific word. For example, let's say I wanted my array to read a series of words until it reached the word \"okay\" from std in, print out each word, and then terminate before printing out \"okay\". The length of this array will be unknown, so I am confused on how to do this.     String s  = sc.next();     String[] copy = new String[???];     for( int i = 0; i < copy.length; i++ ){           copy[i] = sc.next();          }\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String s = sc.next();\nint i = 0;\nwhile (s != \"okay\") {\nString word = s;\ns = sc.next();\ncopy[i++] = word;\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The StringTokenizer class is used to split a string into a sequence of tokens. The nextToken() method of the StringTokenizer class returns the next token in the sequence. The while loop continues until the nextToken() method returns the string \"okay\". The String array is created using an array of size 1 and then appending each word to it using the nextToken() method."}
