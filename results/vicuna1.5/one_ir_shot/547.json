USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Wedriver Windows popup handling: :This question already has answers here:                                                            Closed 10 years ago.Possible Duplicate:display image from URL retrieved from ALAsset in iPhone My code is:Set<String> windowsid = driver.getWindowHandles();Iterator<String> iterate = windowsid.iterator();while(iterate.hasNext()){    System.out.println(iterate.next());}String mainwindow_id = iterate.next();String tabbedwindow_id = iterate.next();I get an error @ String mainwindow_id = iterate.next();Stating the below, Line 45 is the one i have in quotes.

In this case, it is being used to retrieve the next element of the LinkedHashMap, which is the key-value pair that is stored at the current position of the iterator. The error message suggests that the iterator has reached the end of the map and has returned a NoSuchElementException."}
