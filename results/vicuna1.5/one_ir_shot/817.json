This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: My Java code always give false value but my API got it true?: :I have problem with my code.Here is a picThe result is always false.but in my APIboth results are true.Here part of my Java code. Any help?public class Main {    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"in.txt\"));        PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(\"result.txt\"), true);             String User;        while ((User = br.readLine()) != null){            URL url = new URL(\"http://mysecretweb.com/r/migrate.php?name=\"+User);            URLConnection connection = url.openConnection();            BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(connection.getInputStream()));            boolean result = Boolean.valueOf(reader.readLine());            String str = Boolean.toString(result);            System.out.println(User+\" is \"+str);            out.write(User+\" is \"+str);            out.write(\"\\r\\n\");                           }        }    }\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(\"result.txt\"), true);\n<<<explanation>>>: The write() method of the PrintWriter class writes a sequence of characters to the specified output stream. In this case, the output stream is a FileWriter that writes to a file named \"result.txt\". The true parameter indicates that the writer should automatically flush the output buffer after each write operation."}
