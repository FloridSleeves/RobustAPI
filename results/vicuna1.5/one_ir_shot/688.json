This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Synchronized writing and reading in file with not join object variable of file: :I'm trying to implement threads concurrency in Java. It consists of trying to write in the file for the last time. There are two threads: A - which is creating a file and checking if the right line is in the file and B - which is searching for a file and trying to rewrite the file with a \u201cgood\u201d line. The \u201cwinner\u201d thread must have string in a file. To do it thread checks if file has their line, file has only one line. The threads have only file path.public class A implements Runnable {private File file;private Thread t;public A(String patch,String fileName){    t = new Thread(this);    CreateFile(patch, fileName);    //t.setDaemon(true);    t.start();}@Overridepublic void run() {    BufferedReader reader;    while (!Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) {        try {            reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream(file)));            if (reader.readLine().charAt(0) == 'B') {                System.out.println(\"A try took file: \" + file.getName());                write();            } else {                System.out.println(\"A took file: \" + file.getName());            }        } catch (FileNotFoundException e)        {            System.out.println(\"File read A\" + e.toString());        }        catch (IOException e)        {            System.out.println(\"File read A\"+e.toString());        }    }}private void write() {    try {        PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(file);        printWriter.println(\"A took file: \" + file.getName());        System.out.println(\"A took file: \" + file.getName());        printWriter.close();    } catch (Exception e) {        System.out.println(\"File write A\");    }}public File CreateFile(String patch,String fileName) {    File file = new File(patch,fileName+\".txt\");    try {        PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(file);        printWriter.println(\"A took file: \" + file.getName());        System.out.println(\"A took file: \" + file.getName());        printWriter.close();    } catch (Exception e) {        System.out.println(\"File create A\");    }    return file;}}public class B implements Runnable {private File file;private Thread t;public B(String patch,String fileName){    t = new Thread(this);    //t.setDaemon(true);    FindFile(patch, fileName);    t.start();}@Overridepublic void run() {    BufferedReader reader;    while (!Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) {        try {            reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream(file)));            if (reader.readLine().charAt(0) == 'A') {                System.out.println(\"B try took file: \" + file.getName());                write();            } else {                System.out.println(\"B took file: \" + file.getName());            }        } catch (FileNotFoundException e)        {            System.out.println(\"File read B\" + e.toString());        }        catch (IOException e)        {            System.out.println(\"File read B\"+e.toString());        }    }}private void write() {    try {        PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(file);        printWriter.println(\"B took file: \" + file.getName());        System.out.println(\"B took file: \" + file.getName());        printWriter.close();    } catch (Exception e) {        System.out.println(\"File write B\");    }}public File FindFile(String patch,String fileName) {    File file= null;    File folder = new File(patch);    File[] listOfFiles = folder.listFiles();    BufferedReader reader;    for (int i = 0; i < listOfFiles.length; i++) {        file = listOfFiles[i];        if (file.getName().equals(fileName + \".txt\")) {            break;        }    }    return file;}}I want to synchronize in some way access to the file in threads. In my code I have java.lang.NullPointerException when I use readLine(), so I think this is because threads don\u2019t have synchronized access to the file (after every finished operation file must have one line). I can\u2019t use synchronized method or block, because threads don\u2019t have joint variable of the file. Is there some way of making synchronized writing and reading in the file?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(file);\nprintWriter.println(\"A took file: \" + file.getName());\nprintWriter.close();\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The PrintWriter class provides a way to write text to a file. The write() method of the PrintWriter class writes a string to the file. The close() method of the PrintWriter class closes the file stream. By using the PrintWriter class, you can synchronize the writing process in the file."}
