The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: StringTokenizer not working: :                                This question is unlikely to help any future visitors; it is only relevant to a small geographic area, a specific moment in time,  or an extraordinarily narrow situation that is not generally applicable to the worldwide audience of the internet.

Closed 10 years ago.I have a string as str=123|apple|apple|apple|dog$i like to seperate string using \"|\" character.    String str = \"123|apple|apple|apple|dog$\";    StringTokenizer strString = new StringTokenizer(str..nextToken(), \"|\");    int i;    while (strString.hasMoreElements()) {        if (i == 0)            str1 = Loginstring.nextToken();        else if (i == 1)            str2 = Integer.Loginstring.nextToken();        else if (i == 2) {            str3 = Loginstring.nextToken();            break;        }        i = i + 1;    }but it exit on first loop onwards(that means it exit from loop if i more than 1),, really i dont know y its happens, whats wrong with it\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String str = \"123|apple|apple|apple|dog$\";\nStringTokenizer strString = new StringTokenizer(str, \"|\");\nint i;\nwhile (strString.hasMoreElements()) {\nif (i == 0)\nstr1 = strString.nextToken();\nelse if (i == 1)\nstr2 = Integer.parseInt(strString.nextToken());\nelse if (i == 2) {\nstr3 = strString.nextToken();\nbreak;\n}\ni = i + 1;\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem with the code is that the nextToken() method returns a string, but it is being cast to an integer in the second iteration of the loop. This will cause a compilation error. The correct way to do this is to use the nextToken() method to get the next token as a string and then use the parseInt() method to convert it to an integer."}
