{"api": "DataOutputStream.write", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to send XML data through socket InputStream: :I'm trying to write a client-server application in Java with an XML-based protocol.But I have a great problem!See this part of client code:InputStream incoming = skt.getInputStream(); //I get Stream from Socket.OutputStream out = skt.getOutputStream();[...]XMLSerializer serializer = new XMLSerializer();//This create an XML document.tosend = WUTPClientWriter.createMessage100(projectid, cpuclock, cpunumber);serializer.setOutputByteStream(out);serializer.serialize(tosend);At this point server fall in deadlock. It wait for EOF but I can't send it because if I use out.close();orskt.shutdownOutput();I close the Socket and I must keep this connection alive.I can't send '\\0' becouse I get Parse Error in the server.How can I do it? Can I \"close\" the output stream without closing the socket?RESOLVEDI've created new class XMLStreamOutput and XMLStreamInput with advanced Stream gesture.\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: DataOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>: DataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(out);\ndos.writeUTF(\"<?xml version=\\\"1.0\\\" encoding=\\\"UTF-8\\\"?>\\n\");\ndos.writeUTF(\"<message>\\n\");\ndos.writeInt(projectid);\ndos.writeInt(cpuclock);\ndos.writeInt(cpunumber);\ndos.writeUTF(\"</message>\\n\");\ndos.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: This code creates a new DataOutputStream object and writes the XML data to it. The writeUTF() method is used to write the XML declaration and the message data. The writeInt() method is used to write the integer values. Finally, the close() method is called to close the DataOutputStream."}
