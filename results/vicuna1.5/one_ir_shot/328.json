{"api": "Iterator.next", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Remove last character of a StringBuilder?: :When you have to loop through a collection and make a string of each data separated by a delimiter, you always end up with an extra delimiter at the end, e.g.for (String serverId : serverIds) {  sb.append(serverId);   sb.append(\",\");}Gives something like : serverId_1, serverId_2, serverId_3,I would like to delete the last character in the StringBuilder (without converting it because I still need it after this loop).\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\nfor (String serverId : serverIds) {\nsb.append(serverId);\nsb.append(\",\");\n}\nIterator<Character> iterator = sb.iterator();\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\nchar c = iterator.next();\nsb.deleteCharAt(sb.length() - 1);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The deleteCharAt() method of the StringBuilder class deletes the character at the specified index. The hasNext() method of the Iterator interface returns true if the iterator has more elements. The next() method of the Iterator interface returns the next element in the iteration."}
