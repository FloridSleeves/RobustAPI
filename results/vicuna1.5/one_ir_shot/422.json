USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Java: Return in a for loop: :Is there a way to return some value from within a for loop without jumping out of the loop? I am implementing a static analysis tool where I have to analyze a list of methods (CFGs) in a for loop. The size of CFG list is not known in advance.  Each method in the for loop has to return some value. As asked above, is there a way to do it in a loop without breaking the loop? One possible alternative comes in mind is that I can unroll the loop, assuming the maximum list size could be some fixed value. But this does not solve the problem completely. Any help would be appreciated.code looks like below.for(CFG cfg: cfgList){   val = analyze(cfg);   return val;   //I want for loop not to stop here.}P.S. I cannot store the values in a list to return values later.Edit1:For example, consider following statements.call method1();st2;st3;...This method1() can be any of five different methods. For all five possible options, I want to analyze each of them, return their values and analyze rest of the statements accordingly. So, I would analyze these 5 methods as below.call method1-option1();st2;st3;...call method1-option2();st2;st3;...call method1-option3();st2;st3;...Hope, it helps in understanding the question.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: Iterator<CFG> iterator = cfgList.iterator();\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\nCFG cfg = iterator.next();\nval = analyze(cfg);\nreturn val;\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The next() method of the Iterator interface returns the next element in the iteration order of this iterator.
