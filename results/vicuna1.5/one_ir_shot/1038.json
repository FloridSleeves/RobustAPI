{"api": "StringTokenizer.nextToken", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: What is an efficient way to parse a String in Java?: :How should I parse the following String using Java to extract the file path?? stands for any number of random charaters_ stands for any number of white spaces (no new line)?[LoadFile]_file_=_\"foo/bar/baz.xml\"?Example:10:52:21.212 [LoadFile] file = \"foo/bar/baz.xml\"should extract foo/bar/baz.xml\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String inputString = \"10:52:21.212 [LoadFile]_file_=_\\\"foo/bar/baz.xml\\\"\";\nString filePath = StringTokenizer.nextToken(inputString, \"_\\\\s*\").trim();\n<<<explanation>>>: The StringTokenizer class is used to split a string into a sequence of tokens. The nextToken() method returns the next token in the string, and the trim() method is used to remove any leading or trailing white space. This is an efficient way to parse a string in Java because it only splits the string at the specified delimiter and does not perform any additional processing on the tokens."}
