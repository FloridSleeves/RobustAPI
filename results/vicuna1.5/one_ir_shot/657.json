USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Count occurrences of words in ArrayList: :This question already has answers here:                                                            How to count the number of occurrences of an element in a List                                (25 answers)                            Closed 9 years ago.I have an ArrayList of words with duplicate entries.I want to count and save occurrences for each word in a data structure. How can I do it?\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Map.get\n<<<code>>>: ArrayList<String> words = new ArrayList<String>();\nwords.add(\"apple\");\nwords.add(\"banana\");\nwords.add(\"apple\");\nwords.add(\"orange\");\n\nMap<String, Integer> wordCount = new HashMap<String, Integer>();\nfor (String word : words) {\nwordCount.put(word, wordCount.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);\n}\n\nint[] count = wordCount.values().toArray();\nint sum = Arrays.stream(count).sum();\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < count.length; i++) {\nif (count[i] == 1) {\nSystem.out.println(words.get(i));\n}\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: This code first creates an ArrayList of words with duplicate entries. It then creates a HashMap to count the occurrences of each word. The for-each loop iterates through the ArrayList and adds each word to the HashMap with an initial count of 1. The stream API is used to calculate the sum of the values in the HashMap, which represents the number of occurrences of each word. Finally, the code prints out each word that has only one occurrence."}
