{"api": "PrintWriter.write", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Writing String to Text File: :I am saving a log to a .txt file on the sdcard but once there is two lines saved, it overwrites it and starts over?Here is my code: public static String getTimestamp() {    try {        SimpleDateFormat dateFormat = new SimpleDateFormat(\"MMMdd HH:mm:ss\", Locale.getDefault());        String currentTimeStamp = dateFormat.format(new Date()); // Find todays date        return currentTimeStamp;    } catch (Exception e) {        e.printStackTrace();        return null;    }}public static void writeToLog(Context context, String string) {    String text = getTimestamp() + \" \" + string;    // ONLY SAVES TWO LINES    try {        PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(logFile, true)));        out.println(text);        out.close();    } catch (IOException e) {        Log.d(Constants.APP_NAME, e.toString());    }}As soon as you mount /data in recovery, the log files in /sdcard & /data/media/0 show the full log history but not when the device is powered on\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: String text = getTimestamp() + \" \" + string;\nPrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(logFile, true)));\nout.write(text);\nout.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The write() method of the PrintWriter class writes a sequence of characters to the output stream. In this case, the text variable contains the log message with timestamp and string, and it is written to the log file using the PrintWriter object. The close() method is called to close the PrintWriter and BufferedWriter objects to ensure that the file is properly closed."}
