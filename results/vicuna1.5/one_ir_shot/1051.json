The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Java Shell wildcard tokenizer: :My Java is extremely rusty and I'm stuck trying to make a user interface that simplifies the execution of shell scripts or batch files depending on whether it's Linus or Win32  respectively. The files have the following naming convention.  module-verb-object-etc [args-list]  mysql-connect-grid  mysql-connect-rds  mysql-dump-grid  mysql-dump-grid-se314ultimately I would like it to parse unambiguous terms so I can:tokenize the commands (e.g delimited by \"-\") & shorten them into simplified terms soemthing like foxpro's command window or cisco's IOS  (eg \"my co gr\" executes \"mysql-connect-grid\" in unix and *.cmd in win32)and also in the style of IOS allow the user to enter abbreviated commands so that they can type in  a question mark (?) and it will give them a hint as to the unique remaining (or next) command options (e.g. \"my?\" returns mysql  & \"my ?\" returns connect, or dump). Othr return values would be \"ambiguous\" or \"unknown\" for commands that are not unique or could not be matched. It may seem trivial but there are many hundreds of commands in each folder and my users don't want to think... I wrote a function to pull the list of files from a directory & retun an array of fileanmes. Then I convert that into a 2 dimensional array using the method below which returns a dynamicly sized grid of potential commands.    /**********************************************************************************     *  MAKE GRID: Parses array of filenames and tokenizes AWS cmds.     * @param strs  Array of filenames     **********************************************************************************/     public static String [][] makeGrid(String strs[], boolean bPrint) {       String tmpGrid[][];       int nMaxCols = 0;       int nRows = uniqueCount(strs);       int nGridRow = 0;        tmpGrid = new String [nRows][];        for (int nRow=0; nRow<nRows; nRow++) {  String cFilename = strs[nRow];                if (!cFilename.endsWith(\".cmd\") // just list unix files (filter for batch files)    && cFilename.indexOf(\"-\") > 0 ) // make sure there's a dash in the filename    {           String strTokens[] = tokenize(strs[nRow], \"-\"); // the dash is our token deliminator           int nCols = strTokens.length;            if (nCols>nMaxCols) nMaxCols=nCols;           tmpGrid[nGridRow] = new String [nCols];           for (int nCol=0; nCol<nCols; nCol++) {                tmpGrid[nGridRow][nCol] = strTokens[nCol];               if (bPrint) System.out.print(\" \"+tmpGrid[nGridRow][nCol]);             }            nGridRow++;            if (bPrint) System.out.println(\"\");     } //end-if         }       String[][] cmdGrid = new String[nGridRow][nMaxCols];       System.arraycopy(tmpGrid, 0, cmdGrid, 0, nGridRow); // removes null rows  (&NPEs!)       return cmdGrid;      }This returns a 2-d array (below), so grid[Row-N][Col-0] is a match. I'd like to pull only distinct values where row[0] is a wildcard match for cmdToken[0] && row[1] is \"like\" cmdToken[1] so that my users can piece together a command until \"my du gr ?\" returns \"ENTER, [se314]\" - if that makes sense...String[][] makeGrid:    mysql dump grid se314    mysql connect grid    mysql dump grid    mysql connect rdsMy Challenge: I cant seem to get my head around my matcher function in java. If it was SQL it would be something like: \"SELECT DISTINCT col2 FROM cmd_Grid   WHERE col1 LIKE 'cmdToken1%' \" or even better: recursively setting a int depthmark for each consecutive column`SELECT DISTINCT col+str(depthmark+1) FROM cmd_Grid     WHERE col+str(depthmark) LIKE 'cmdMatchedTokens%' \" until you have an exact match. I found a package called joSQL that I tried out of desperation but I cant seem to get it to work in Java6. Anyway: I was also hoping for a pure java solution so that everything could be contained in a single class... Maybe using scanner or something to parse my multidimentional array for unique values... I know I'm probably making it way more complex than it needs to be. a gentle nudge in the right direction would be appreciated.TIA\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String str = \"mysql dump grid se314\";\nString[] tokens = str.split(\"\\\\s+\");\nString cmdToken = tokens[0];\nString[] cmdTokens = tokens[1].split(\"\\\\s+\");\nString[] uniqueTokens = new String[cmdTokens.length];\nfor (int i = 0; i < cmdTokens.length; i++) {\nuniqueTokens[i] = cmdTokens[i];\n}\nArrays.sort(uniqueTokens);\nString[] distinctTokens = new String[uniqueTokens.length];\nfor (int i = 0; i < uniqueTokens.length; i++) {\ndistinctTokens[i] = uniqueTokens[i];\n}\nint depth = 1;\nfor (int i = 0; i < distinctTokens.length; i++) {\nif (distinctTokens[i].equals(cmdToken)) {\nint j = i;\nwhile (j < distinctTokens.length && distinctTokens[j].equals(cmdToken)) {\nj++;\n}\nif (j == i) {\ndistinctTokens[i] = cmdToken + \" \" + depth;\n} else {\ndistinctTokens[i] = distinctTokens[j];\n}\n}\ndepth++;\n}\nString[] distinctCmdTokens = distinctTokens;\n<<<explanation>>>: This code first splits the input string into tokens using the split() method and stores them in an array called tokens. Then, it extracts the first token (cmdToken) and splits the second token (cmdTokens) into an array. Next, it creates an array to store unique tokens, sorts them, and assigns the first occurrence of each unique token to the array. Finally, it iterates through the array, comparing each token to the cmdToken and updating the array if a match is found. The depth variable keeps track of the level of matching tokens."}
