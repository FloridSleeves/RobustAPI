USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: My method to create directories doesn't create folders: :It's the first time ever I tried to create a directory and following some links and directions from previous posts of other users I managed to cook up the following method.But it doesn't work.The condition to trigger this method is 100% certainly triggered. So the error has to be in here. But I cant figure out what I did wrong since I am a first-timer with this.   public void makeDirectory(String path, String nameFolder) {    File dir = new File(path + \"\\nameFolder\");    dir.mkdir();}Thank you for your timeEDIT: 'Doesn't work' means no directory is being created.EDIT2:Have been able to make it work thx to Niks Tyagi    public void makeDirectory(String path, String nameFolder) {    File dir = new File(path +\"\\\\\"+ nameFolder);    dir.mkdirs();}\nPlease using this api: File.mkdirs.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: File.mkdirs\n<<<code>>>: public void makeDirectory(String path, String nameFolder) {\nFile dir = new File(path + \"\\\\\" + nameFolder);\ndir.mkdirs();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The mkdirs() method of the File class creates a directory, if it does not already exist. This method creates the directory without any further action, such as creating a parent directory if needed."}
