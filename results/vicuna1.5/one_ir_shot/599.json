USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Handling large number of clickable rows: :I'm working on an Android project that has quite a few screens with upwards of 200 rows that will be clickable per screen.  The issue I am trying to figure out is how to make them all able to be clicked without adding 200 lines of TableRow r1 = (TableRow) findViewById(R.id.table_row_1);TableRow r2 = (TableRow) findViewById(R.id.table_row_2);TableRow r3 = (TableRow) findViewById(R.id.table_row_3);TableRow r4 = (TableRow) findViewById(R.id.table_row_4);r1.setOnClickListener(listener);r2.setOnClickListener(listener);r3.setOnClickListener(listener);r4.setOnClickListener(listener);Eventually the rows will take their id's and search the database for the value (I'm going to use each table row as a key for a value in the database to populate a column in the row) but for now I'm just trying to change the background color of the row when each one is clicked.Questions:How can I handle a large number of clickable rows without thousands of lines of redundant code?  Do I need to set an OnClickListener for each row or is there a better method that I am over looking?  Is there a way to do it in the XML maybe?\nPlease using this api: List.get.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: List.get\n<<<code>>>: List<TableRow> tableRows = new ArrayList<>();\ntableRows.add(r1);\ntableRows.add(r2);\ntableRows.add(r3);\ntableRows.add(r4);\n\nfor (TableRow row : tableRows) {\nrow.setOnClickListener(listener);\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: Instead of setting the OnClickListener for each row in the code, you can add all the TableRows to a List and then iterate through the List and set the OnClickListener for each row in the loop. This way, you can avoid writing thousands of lines of redundant code."}
