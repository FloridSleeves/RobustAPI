USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Write a function that reverses the order of the words in a string?: :                                It's difficult to tell what is being asked here. This question is ambiguous, vague, incomplete, overly broad, or rhetorical and  cannot be reasonably answered in its current form.

Closed 11 years ago.Im reading the book \"programming interviews exposed\" and the following question was interesting to me:Write a function that reverses the order of the words in a string. For  example, your function should transform the string \u201cDo or do not,  there is no try.\u201d to \u201ctry. no is there not, do or Do\u201d. Assume that all  words are space delimited and treat punctuation the same as letters.this image was included to help with the design of the algorithm: what is the most efficient way of implementing this in JAVA?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: String str = \"Do or do not, there is no try.\";\nString[] words = str.split(\" \");\nIterator<String> it = words.iterator();\nwhile (it.hasNext()) {\nString word = it.next();\nSystem.out.print(word);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: This solution uses the split() method to split the string into an array of words, and then uses an iterator to iterate through the array. The next() method is called on the iterator to retrieve each word, and the print() method is used to output each word. This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of words in the string."}
