{"api": "InputStream.read", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: file comparison with memory consideration: :I want to compare two files, one is in file system and the other is being downloaded from a HTTP URL. We have tried to compare by byte[] arrays (we used HTTPRequestBuilder by Apache), but the concern is that the files may be too large and they may exhaust the memory. Do we have any good alternates.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.io.InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: InputStream inputStream1 = new FileInputStream(\"file1.txt\");\nInputStream inputStream2 = new URL(\"http://example.com/file2.txt\").openStream();\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\nint bytesRead1 = inputStream1.read(buffer);\nint bytesRead2 = inputStream2.read(buffer);\nlong fileSize1 = inputStream1.available();\nlong fileSize2 = inputStream2.available();\nlong diff = fileSize1 - fileSize2;\nint diffInBytes = (int) (diff * 1024);\n<<<explanation>>>: This code reads the files \"file1.txt\" and \"file2.txt\" using InputStream and compares their sizes by calculating the difference in bytes. The InputStream.read() method reads a specified number of bytes from the input stream into an array. The available() method returns the number of bytes that can be read from the input stream without blocking. The difference in file sizes can be calculated by subtracting the file size of one file from the file size of the other file. The difference in bytes can be calculated by multiplying the difference in file sizes by 1024 (the size of the buffer used to read the files)."}
