{"api": "StringTokenizer.nextToken", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to tokenize a set of lines from a given input?: :I'm trying something pretty simple.I have to read the following input line by line and create an ArrayList of Integers for every line.2 5 103 5 15I'm trying to process it using the following codewhile((newLine=f.readLine()) != null){    for(int k=0; k<newLine.length(); k++){        StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(newLine);        int i1 = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());         System.out.println(\"Adding to list\"+i1);        input.add(i1);    }}As you can see, I'm reinitializing st to newLine each time, instead of moving onto the next token. Any thoughts on how I can achieve what I am intending to?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String input = \"2 5 103 5 15\";\nString[] tokens = input.split(\" \");\nint[] integers = new int[tokens.length];\nfor (int i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {\nintegers[i] = Integer.parseInt(tokens[i]);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The split() method of the String class splits a string into an array of substrings based on a specified separator. In this case, the space character is used as the separator. The nextToken() method of the StringTokenizer class returns the next token in the input string. By using a for loop and the nextToken() method, you can iterate through the input string and parse each token into an integer, which can then be added to an ArrayList."}
