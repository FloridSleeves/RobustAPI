{"api": "StringTokenizer.nextToken", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Converting string with letters and numbers: :So I have a String declared as String name = \"John 20150.00\" and I want to break up the name into a different variable and the number into a different variable, is this possible? I tried using the Double.parseDouble(name); method, but when it runs, it doesn't work right. What should I use?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String name = \"John 20150.00\";\nString firstName = name.split(\" \")\n                      .stream()\n                      .filter(s -> s.matches(\"[A-Za-z]+\"))\n                      .findFirst()\n                      .orElse(\"\");\ndouble amount = Double.parseDouble(name.split(\" \")[2]);\n<<<explanation>>>: The StringTokenizer class is used to split a string into a sequence of tokens. The nextToken() method returns the next token in the sequence. The filter() method is used to filter out unwanted tokens. The findFirst() method is used to find the first token that matches a given condition. The orElse() method is used to provide a default value if the condition is not met."}
