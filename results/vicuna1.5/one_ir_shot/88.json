This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Best way to write a text file to internal sorage?: :I'm trying to write a text file to an internal storage and wondered what's the best way would be to do it, the text file will contain strings.I have:    File file = new File(getFilesDir() + subFolderName + \"/\" + fileName);                BufferedWriter writer;                try {                    writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(file));                    writer.write(\"ID, Date, Address, Body\");                    writer.write(\"\\n\");                    for (String s : list) {                        writer.write(s);                        writer.write(\"\\n\");                    }                    writer.write(\"\\n\");                    writer.flush();                    writer.close();                } catch (IOException e) {                                       e.printStackTrace();}I just get a java.lang.NullPointerException at the creation of the new file :/Thanks in advance.This is the code which i ended up with which worked as i wanted it to:public void WriteFileInternal(ArrayList<String> list, String FileName, Context context) {    BufferedWriter bw;    try {        ContextWrapper cw = new ContextWrapper(context);        File directory = cw.getDir(\"SMSMonitor\", Context.MODE_PRIVATE);        if (!directory.exists()){            directory.createNewFile();            directory.mkdir();            }        File file = new File(directory +\"/\"+ FileName);        file.createNewFile();        bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(file));        bw.write(\"ID, Date, Body, Phone Number\");        bw.write(\"\\n\");        for (String s1 : list) {            bw.write(s1);            bw.write(\"\\n\");        }        bw.write(\"\\n\");        bw.flush();        bw.close();    } catch (Exception e) {        e.printStackTrace();    }}\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: DataOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>: DataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(file));\ndos.writeUTF(\"ID, Date, Address, Body\");\ndos.writeUTF(\"\\n\");\nfor (String s : list) {\ndos.writeUTF(s);\ndos.writeUTF(\"\\n\");\n}\ndos.writeUTF(\"\\n\");\ndos.flush();\ndos.close();\n\nExplanation: The DataOutputStream class is used to write binary data to a file. The writeUTF() method is used to write a string as a sequence of bytes in the UTF-8 format. The flush() method is used to force the data to be written to the file. The close() method is used to close the file."}
