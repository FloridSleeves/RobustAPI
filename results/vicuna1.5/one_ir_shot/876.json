USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Search through SQLite database on Android Search: :Method causing error inside my ContentProviderpublic static Cursor getSuggestions(String query) {    SQLiteDatabase db = dbHelper.getReadableDatabase();    db.beginTransaction();    try {        String selection = Formula.FORMULA_NAME + \" LIKE %?%\";        String[] selectionArgs = { query + \"*\" };        Cursor cursor = dbHelper.getReadableDatabase().query(                FORMULA_TABLE_NAME,                new String[] { BaseColumns._ID,                        SearchManager.SUGGEST_COLUMN_TEXT_1,                         BaseColumns._ID + \" AS \" + SearchManager.SUGGEST_COLUMN_INTENT_DATA_ID                         },                         selection,                selectionArgs, null, null, null);        db.setTransactionSuccessful();        return cursor;    } catch (SQLiteException e) {    } finally {        db.endTransaction();    }    throw new SQLException(\"Failed to begin transaction\");}Database creation:db.execSQL(\"CREATE TABLE \" + FORMULA_TABLE_NAME + \" (\" +                BaseColumns._ID + \" INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\" +                SearchManager.SUGGEST_COLUMN_TEXT_1 + \" TEXT,\" +                Formula.CATEGORY + \" TEXT\" +                \");\");Constants used:    public static final String FORMULA_NAME = SearchManager.SUGGEST_COLUMN_TEXT_1;    public static final String CATEGORY = \"category\";The problem is that in my method, the transaction is unsuccessful because it throws the error: throw new SQLException(\"Failed to begin transaction\"); What I'm trying to do is to search through the database as part of a search. When the user activates the search box, then I have it set up so that this method should be returning a cursor with the suspected items based on their name. Through debugging, I deduced that the problem was with the method of search inside my Content Provider. Any solutions or thoughts?\nPlease using this api: SQLiteDatabase.query.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: SQLiteDatabase.query\n<<<code>>>: SQLiteDatabase db = dbHelper.getReadableDatabase();\nCursor cursor = db.query(FORMULA_TABLE_NAME, new String[] { BaseColumns._ID, SearchManager.SUGGEST_COLUMN_TEXT_1, BaseColumns._ID + \" AS \" + SearchManager.SUGGEST_COLUMN_INTENT_DATA_ID }, Formula.FORMULA_NAME + \" LIKE ?\", new String[] { query + \"*\"}, null, null, null);\n<<<explanation>>>: The query() method of the SQLiteDatabase class is used to execute a raw SQL statement or a SELECT statement on the database. The first argument is the name of the table to query, the second argument is an array of column names to return, the third argument is the SQL selection string, the fourth argument is an array of values to substitute into the selection string, the fifth argument is an array of values to substitute into the selection string for the \"LIKE\" operator, the sixth argument is an array of values to substitute into the selection string for the \"IN\" operator, the seventh argument is an array of values to substitute into the selection string for the \"BETWEEN\" operator, and the eighth argument is an array of values to substitute into the selection string for the \"IS NULL\" operator. The result of the query is returned as a Cursor object."}
