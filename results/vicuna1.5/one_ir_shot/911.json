USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I stop XmlSerializer transforming &#234; to &amp;#234; in an attribute?: :I have the following DOM    <row>        <link href=\"B&#252;ro.txt\" target=\"_blank\">            my link        </link>    </row>When I serialize it to a file using the Java XmlSerializer it comes out like this:    <row>        <link href=\"B&amp;#252;ro.txt\" target=\"_blank\">            my link        </link>    </row>Is there any way to control the way XmlSerializer handles escaping in attributes? Should I be doing this differently any way?UpdateI should also say that I am using jre 1.6. I had been using jre 1.5 until recently and I am pretty sure that it was serialized 'correctly' (i.e. the '&' was not escaped)ClarificationThe DOM is created programmatically. Here is an example:        Document doc = createDocument();        Element root = doc.createElement(\"root\");        doc.appendChild(root);        root.setAttribute(\"test1\", \"&#234;\");        root.setAttribute(\"test2\", \"\u00fc\u00f6\u00e4\");        root.appendChild(doc.createTextNode(\"&#234;\"));        StringWriter sw = new StringWriter();        serializeDocument(doc, sw);        System.out.println(sw.toString());My solutionI didn't really want to do this because it involved a fair amount of code change and testing but I decided to move the attribute data into a CDATA element. Problem solved avoided.\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: String.getBytes\n<<<code>>>: String inputString = \"B\u00fcro.txt\";\nbyte[] byteArray = inputString.getBytes();\n<<<explanation>>>: The getBytes() method of the String class returns an array of bytes containing the encoded form of the string. This method returns the same byte array as the one returned by the getBytes() method of the Charset class."}
