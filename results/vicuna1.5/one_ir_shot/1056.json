{"api": "StringTokenizer.nextToken", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Splitting strings based on a delimiter: :I am trying to break apart a very simple collection of strings that come in the forms of0|010|1530|55etc etc. Essentially numbers that are seperated by pipes.When I use java's string split function with .split(\"|\"). I get somewhat unpredictable results. white space in the first slot, sometimes the number itself isn't where I thought it should be.Can anybody please help and give me advice on how I can use a reg exp to keep ONLY the integers?I was asked to give the code trying to do the actual split. So allow me to do that in hopes to clarify further my problem :)String temp = \"0|0\";String splitString = temp.split(\"|\");results\\n0| 0I am trying to get00only. Forever grateful for any help ahead of time :)\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String temp = \"0|0\";\nString[] splitString = temp.split(\"\\\\|\");\nString result = String.join(\"\", splitString);\n<<<explanation>>>: The StringTokenizer class can be used to split a string into tokens based on a specified delimiter. In this case, the delimiter is \"|\". The nextToken() method of the StringTokenizer class returns the next token in the string. The splitString array is then joined back into a single string using the String.join() method."}
