{"api": "Activity.findViewById", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to make my image visible by time counter?: :I want to make simple animation using multi-images on android studioi have 3 images (img1,img2,img3)and i want img1 visible firstly then after half second img1 invisible and img2 visible,then after half second img2 invisible and img3 visible,then after half second img3 invisible and img1 visible, so return to the first image like circle 1>2>3>1>2>3>1>2>3 to unlimited time, so how can i do that, please\nPlease using this api: Activity.findViewById.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Activity.findViewById\n<<<code>>>: ImageView img1 = (ImageView) findViewById(R.id.img1);\nImageView img2 = (ImageView) findViewById(R.id.img2);\nImageView img3 = (ImageView) findViewById(R.id.img3);\nHandler handler = new Handler();\nhandler.postDelayed(new Runnable() {\n@Override\npublic void run() {\nimg1.setVisibility(View.INVISIBLE);\nimg2.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);\n}\n}, 500);\nhandler.postDelayed(new Runnable() {\n@Override\npublic void run() {\nimg2.setVisibility(View.INVISIBLE);\nimg3.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);\n}\n}, 500);\nhandler.postDelayed(new Runnable() {\n@Override\npublic void run() {\nimg3.setVisibility(View.INVISIBLE);\nimg1.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);\n}\n}, 500);\nhandler.postDelayed(new Runnable() {\n@Override\npublic void run() {\nimg1.setVisibility(View.INVISIBLE);\n}\n}, Integer.MAX\\_VALUE);\n<<<explanation>>>: This code uses a Handler to post a runnable task to the main thread every half second, which changes the visibility of the images. The first image is made visible, then after half a second it is made invisible and the second image is made visible, and so on. The loop continues indefinitely, making the images appear as a circle."}
