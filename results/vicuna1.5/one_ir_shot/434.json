USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to shuffle a deck of cards using Java (trying to use hashmap, not working)?: :I have a hashmap<Integer, Card> Card is a class. I have initialized the hashmap with keys from 0-51 and the values are array of Card, as followsCard [] card = new Card[52]for (int i=1; i<=13; i++)    for (int j=0; j<4; j++)        card[++index] = new Card( ((i*10)+j) );and I populate the hashmap as follows:for (int i=1; i<=13; i++)    for (int j=0; j<4; j++)        deck.put( ++key, card[++index] );Now, what I want to do is to shuffle the values side of the hashmap, i do not want,for an example, the key[1] corresponds to card[0] and key[1] corresponds to card[1]. I want, for an exampel, the key[1] corresponds to card[38]. I want the values side to be shuffled. I tried the following:Collections.shuffle(card,new Random()); But it seems it accepts only ArrayList and List. \nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: HashMap<Integer, Card> deck = new HashMap<>();\nfor (int i = 1; i <= 13; i++) {\nfor (int j = 0; j < 4; j++) {\ndeck.put(++key, new Card((i * 10) + j));\n}\n}\nIterator<Map.Entry<Integer, Card>> iterator = deck.entrySet().iterator();\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\nMap.Entry<Integer, Card> entry = iterator.next();\nCard card = entry.getValue();\nint randomIndex = new Random().nextInt(card.getSuit().size());\ncard.setSuit(deck.get(randomIndex).getSuit());\niterator.remove();\ndeck.put(entry.getKey(), card);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: This code first initializes a HashMap called \"deck\" with keys from 0-51 and the values are arrays of Card. Then it populates the hashmap with the desired values. Then it creates an Iterator to iterate through the entries of the hashmap. Then it uses the Iterator to remove the first element from the hashmap and then add it back with a new suit. This is done by getting the random index of the suit and then setting the suit of the card to that suit. This process is repeated for all the elements in the hashmap."}
