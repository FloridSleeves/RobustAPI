USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: DatagramSocket fails on Android with 'Try Again': :I am trying to send DatagramPackets (UDP) in my Android application://create a byte to receive datamClientSocket = new DatagramSocket();byte[] receiveData = new byte[MAX_RECEIVE_DATA_SIZE_BYTES];DatagramPacket receivePacket = new DatagramPacket(receiveData,        receiveData.length);// Set a receive timeoutmClientSocket.setSoTimeout(timeout);// receive the packetmClientSocket.receive(receivePacket);return new String(receivePacket.getData(), 0,        receivePacket.getLength());I get the following error:Try againAm I missing something here?\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: String.getBytes()\n<<<code>>>: String message = \"Hello, world!\";\nbyte[] receiveData = message.getBytes();\n<<<explanation>>>: The getBytes() method of the String class returns an array of bytes containing the encoded form of the string. This method is used to convert a string to its byte representation."}
