USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: remove item from comparable array: :I'm very new to java and my first question is what is this Comparable thing? and in my sample code, why Class Bag<T extends Comparable<T>>?? What's the purpose?My second question is how to remove an item from this Comparable array. I have wrote the removeMin method, I have found the item, I named the variable \"min\", how do I go on and remove this min item from the arrayList? Thanks a lot!Here's some partial code:public class Bag<T extends Comparable<T>> implements Iterable<T> {    private int MAX_ITEMS = 10; // initial array size    private int size;    private Comparable[] data;    public Bag( ) {        //data = (Comparable []) new Object[MAX_ITEMS];        data = (T []) new Comparable[MAX_ITEMS];        size = 0;    }      public Comparable removeMin(){          Iterator<T> iterator=iterator();          T min = iterator.next();          while (iterator.hasNext())          {               T next = iterator.next();             if (min.compareTo(next) > 0)                 min = next;                ****************************************************                How to remove this min item?                 ****************************************************                }          return min;          }\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: T min = iterator.next();\n<<<explanation>>>: The next() method of the Iterator interface returns the next element in the iteration order of the iterator. In this case, we are using an Iterator to iterate through the elements of the Bag class and finding the minimum element, which is stored in the variable \"min\". To remove this minimum element from the Bag class, we can use the remove() method of the Iterator interface, passing in the minimum element as an argument. However, since we are using a Comparable array, we need to cast the element to the correct type before removing it."}
