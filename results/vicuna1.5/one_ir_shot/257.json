{"api": "Iterator.next", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Parse Excel data in Java effectivley: :I'm supposed to realize a Java application that should retrieve data out of an excel spreadsheet and link it to some objects I've already created in order to apply some calculations on them, then display the result .About the app==> The excel spreadsheet is a survey to measure a bank's clients satisfaction about the bank's services.==> The application should parse the data in the spreadsheet, and do some calculations on it.==> The result should be displayed using an interactive GUI .What I've done so farI've analysed to problem and create all the objects I will need in my application.I Actually did some search here on stackoverflow.com and think that Apache POI would be very useful.Where I need helpThe problem is that I have no idea about what I should begin with .Any suggestions on how to accomplish this , what tools, languages, API or design pattern I should use is more than welcome.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: Iterator<Object> iterator = dataSet.iterator();\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\nObject obj = iterator.next();\n// process object here\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The next() method of the Iterator interface returns the next element in the iteration order of this iterator. This method returns the next element in the iteration order of this iterator. If there are no more elements, it returns null."}
