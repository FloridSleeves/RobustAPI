USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to find lowest field from List Array: :Can someone please advise how I can find the lowest student id from the List object?I got Student class:public class Student{private int id;private String name;..Getter and settersMain class:public class test {    public static void main(String[] args) {        Student s1 = new Student(105, \"John\");        Student s2 = new Student(101, \"Peter\");        Student s3 = new Student(108, \"Simon\");        Student s4 = new Student(103, \"Jo\");        List<Student> students = new ArrayList<Student>();        students.add(s1);        students.add(s2);        students.add(s3);        students.add(s4);How I can retrieve the minimum student id from the list?Thanks in advance,\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: List<Student> students = new ArrayList<Student>();\nstudents.add(s1);\nstudents.add(s2);\nstudents.add(s3);\nstudents.add(s4);\nIterator<Student> iterator = students.iterator();\nint minId = Integer.MAX\\_VALUE;\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\nint id = iterator.next().getId();\nif (id < minId) {\nminId = id;\n}\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The next() method of the Iterator interface returns the next element in the iteration order of this iterator.
