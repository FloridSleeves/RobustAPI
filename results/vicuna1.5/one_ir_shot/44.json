Preference preference = new Preference(this);        preference.setTitle(app.activityInfo.loadLabel(pm));EDIT:I used this, but it says it requires at least api lvl 11, I hope someone comes with a better solution though:        if(sdk > android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES.HONEYCOMB) {            preference.setIcon(app.loadIcon(pm));            }\nPlease using this api: ApplicationInfo.loadIcon.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: ApplicationInfo.loadIcon\n<<<code>>>: Application app = (Application) getApplicationContext();\nDrawable icon = app.loadIcon(pm);\npreference.setIcon(icon);\n<<<explanation>>>: The loadIcon() method of the Application class returns a Drawable object representing the icon of the application. This method is used to load the icon of the application. The pm parameter is an instance of PackageManager, which is used to retrieve information about the package. This method is available in API level 11 and above."}
