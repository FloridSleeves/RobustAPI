USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: I'm trying to write a program that adds random numbers 0-1000 to a text file: :The user chooses the file name and the number of random numbers. As of now, the program only saves the last random number to the text filepublic static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException, UnsupportedEncodingException {    Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);    System.out.println(\"Enter a filename:\");    String filename = scan.nextLine();    System.out.println(\"Enter a positive Integer:\");    int number = scan.nextInt();    for (int i=0; i<number;i++){        Random rand= new Random();        int random = rand.nextInt(1001);        PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter (filename, \"UTF-8\");        writer.println(random);        writer.close();         System.out.println(random);    }    }\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(filename, \"UTF-8\");\nwriter.write(random);\nwriter.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The write() method of the PrintWriter class writes a sequence of characters to the specified output stream. In this case, the random number is being written to the text file. This is a terminal operation."}
