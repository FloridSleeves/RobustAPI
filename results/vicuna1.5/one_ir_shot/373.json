USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Getting string representations from a hashtable using a toString: :Just wondering what the best way to represent Strings are from Hash tables, I figured you would use an iterator somehow in a toString method but wasn't sure.It should look something like the following{5/10 = 3/9}to{true@5/10}@3/9So far I have ( i know this doesn't use an iterator, since i wasn't really sure how to use it in this regard)@Overridepublic String toString() {    for (Map.Entry<BigFraction, BigFraction> entry : knowledgeD.entrySet()) {        BigFraction key = entry.getKey();        BigFraction value = entry.getValue();where bigfraction is just a fraction datatype, replace it with whatever  you wantAny help would be much appreciated\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: HashTable<BigFraction, BigFraction> knowledgeD = new HashTable<>();\nknowledgeD.put(new BigFraction(5, 10), new BigFraction(3, 9));\nknowledgeD.put(new BigFraction(3, 9), new BigFraction(true, 5));\nIterator<Map.Entry<BigFraction, BigFraction>> iterator = knowledgeD.entrySet().iterator();\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\nMap.Entry<BigFraction, BigFraction> entry = iterator.next();\nBigFraction key = entry.getKey();\nBigFraction value = entry.getValue();\nSystem.out.println(key + \" = \" + value);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The toString() method of the HashTable class returns a string representation of the hash table's entries. This method uses an iterator to iterate over the entries and returns a string representation of each entry in the format you specified. The key and value of each entry are concatenated with an equals sign and a space in between."}
