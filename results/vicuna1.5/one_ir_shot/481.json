{"api": "Iterator.next", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: I want to split a value which is stored in a String while using window handles: :This is my codeSet<String> winHandle = driver.getWindowHandles();System.out.println(winHandle);I want to split winHandle. The value I get when i print the winHandle is like this [{0dd5d2e3-da7f-4a57-ad06-52c19336d3c6}, {a32fd7a5-040f-488f-8bc0-64d9a4496509}]I want to select the Second Value {a32fd7a5-040f-488f-8bc0-64d9a4496509}\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: Set<String> winHandle = driver.getWindowHandles();\nIterator<String> iterator = winHandle.iterator();\nString secondValue = iterator.next();\n<<<explanation>>>: The Iterator.next() method returns the next element in the iterator. In this case, it returns the second element of the Set, which is the value {a32fd7a5-040f-488f-8bc0-64d9a4496509}."}
