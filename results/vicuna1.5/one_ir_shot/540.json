USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Java 1.7: Sum of Iterable<T extends Number>: :I need to create a helper method which allows to create a sum of any Iterable<? extends Number>, because we have many vectors and require a fast method to determine the sum, so I created the following method: static Integer sum(Iterable<Integer> it) {    Integer result = 0;    for(T next : it) {        result += next;    }    return result; }This method only works for ints however, but we also have doubles and longs. Because you can't have two methods with the same signature (Our compiler thinks Integer sum(Iterable<Integer>) has the same signature as Double sum(Iterable<Double>).) I tried to write one method with generics.private static <T extends Number> T sum(Iterable<? extends T> it) {    T result;    for(T next : it) {        result += next;    }    return result;}However this method will not compile (reason: the operator += is undefined for Object, Object). What can I do here? I know in C++ you can overload operators, but not in Java. But every class which extends Number does overload the += operator. What can I do here?Thank you in advance.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: private static <T extends Number> T sum(Iterable<? extends T> it) {\nT result;\nfor(T next : it) {\nresult += next;\n}\nreturn result;\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The issue with the previous implementation is that the operator += is not defined for Object, which is the type of the result variable. To solve this, you can use the Iterator.next() method to get the next element from the Iterable and add it to the result variable. This way, you can overload the += operator for the Number class and use it in the for loop."}
