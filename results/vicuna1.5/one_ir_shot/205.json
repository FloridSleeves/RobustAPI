{"api": "InputStream.read", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Decrypting a CipherInputStream results in an empty stream: :I seem to be have an issue with JCE. I create an CipherInputStream using an encrypting JCE cipher which I then use to create another CipherInputStream using a different decrypting JCE cipher.When I try to read then second stream all I get is empty data. I found no documentation forbidding the above behavior. Does anyone know what the problem is?This is the code which I am running, at the end plainText is empty (the same issue persists regardless of what SecurityProvider I use).InputStream payload = new ByteArrayInputStream(payloadArray);Cipher encryptCipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES\", \"SunJCE\");encryptCipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key, IV);InputStream encryptStream = new CipherInputStream(payload, encryptCipher);Cipher decryptCipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES\", \"SunJCE\");decryptCipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, key, IV);InputStream decryptStream = new CipherInputStream(encryptStream, decryptCipher);byte[] plainText = IOUtisl.toByteArray(decryptStream);Thanks!\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: InputStream inputStream = new CipherInputStream(encryptStream, decryptCipher);\nbyte[] plainText = new byte[inputStream.available()];\ninputStream.read(plainText);\n<<<explanation>>>: The read() method of the InputStream class reads a single byte from the input stream and returns it as an int. The available() method returns an estimate of the number of bytes that can be read from the input stream without blocking. To read the entire input stream, you can use a loop to call read() until the end of the stream is reached."}
