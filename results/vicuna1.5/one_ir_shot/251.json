{"api": "InputStream.read", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to move data from java InputStream to a char * in c++ with jni?: :How can I move the data stored in a java InputStream to a char * in c++ using JNI?Thanks,Carlos.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: JavaNativeWrapper.nativeLoad(\"moveDataFromInputStreamToChar*\", \"()I\", \"(Ljava/io/InputStream;[C)I\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The nativeLoad() method is used to load the native method. The first parameter is the name of the native method, the second parameter is the return type, and the third parameter is the parameter list for the native method. The native method takes an InputStream object and a char\\* array as input and returns an integer value. The type of the char\\* array should be declared as \"const char\\*\" in the C++ code."}
