USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: return an Array which contains only odd integers: :Ok, so I have this problem where when given an Array arr, return an Array which contains only odd integers in the original order from arr.My code:public int [] youMakeMeOdd(int [] arr){   int[] odds;   odds = new int[arr.length];   for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)   {      if(arr[i] % 2 != 0)      {         odds[i] = arr[i];      }   }   return odds;}Few Testers:Expected...........................................................Run:youMakeMeOdd({1,2,3}) \u2192 {1, 3}.....................{1, 0, 3}youMakeMeOdd({2,1,3,5,7}) \u2192 {1, 3, 5, 7}.......{0, 1, 3, 5, 7}youMakeMeOdd({2,4,6,8}) \u2192 {}........................{0, 0, 0, 0}.I can't seem to figure out how to put a blank space there instead of 0's. Help appreciated, thanks :)\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: public int [] youMakeMeOdd(int [] arr){   int[] odds;   odds = new int[arr.length];   Iterator<Integer> it = arr.iterator();   while(it.hasNext()){      int num = it.next();      if(num % 2 != 0)      {         odds[arr.length - 1 - it.hashCode() % odds.length] = num;      }   }   return odds;}\n\nExplanation:\nThe issue with the previous code is that it was not using the correct index to store the odd numbers. Instead of using `i`, which is the index of the current element in the original array, we need to use `arr.length - 1 - it.hashCode() % odds.length` which gives us the correct index to store the odd number in the new array. Additionally, we need to use the `hashCode()` method of the iterator to get a unique index for each element in the array."}
