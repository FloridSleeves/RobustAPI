{"api": "StringTokenizer.nextToken", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Java split String performances: :Here is the current code in my application:String[] ids = str.split(\"/\");When profiling the application, a non-negligeable time is spent string splitting. Also, the split method takes a regular expression, which is superfluous here.What alternative can I use in order to optimize the string splitting? Is StringUtils.split faster?(I would've tried and tested myself but profiling my application takes a lot of time.)\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String[] ids = str.split(\"/\");\nStringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(str, \"/\");\nids = new String[st.countTokens()];\nfor (int i = 0; i < ids.length; i++) {\nids[i] = st.nextToken();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken() method can be used as an alternative to String.split() method. It splits a string into an array of tokens based on a specified delimiter. It is faster than String.split() method as it does not create a regular expression object."}
