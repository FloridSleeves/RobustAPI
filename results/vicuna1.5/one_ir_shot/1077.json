The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: External SD card path in android version 4.0+ to read files: :I am developing an android app to read video files from the external SD card to perform some function on them. To test my code, I have tried to hardcode the path of SD card like,File file = new File(\"/storage/632E-1AFA/Champion.mp4\");But now I want to make this app run on multiple devices. So I want a universal method to get the external SD card path. I have tried the getExternalStorageDirectory method but it points to the internal storage of the phone. The getExternalFilesDir points to your internal application files. I have also tried the System.getenv() method with the help of - Android Open External Storage directory(sdcard) for storing file and Find an external SD card location but it is returning a null path when I tried to debug the code.My app includes both the read and write permissions for external storage:<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\" /><uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\" />I am testing my app on Android 6.0, so I have included the run-time permissions as well. Please if someone could help me find a method or an approach that would get the path of an external sd card to run on multipe mobile devices, I would greatly appreciate it.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String path = getExternalStorageDirectory().getPath();\npath = path.replaceFirst(\"\\\\D+\", \"\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The getExternalStorageDirectory() method returns a Directory object representing the root directory of the external storage. The path property of the Directory object returns the path of the external storage. The replaceFirst() method of the String class replaces the first substring of this string that matches the given regular expression with the given replacement. In this case, it replaces all non-alphanumeric characters with an empty string, resulting in a valid path for the external SD card."}
