USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Inputting a sorted file, unsorting it, then outputting the unsorted file (Java): :This project is supposed to have 3 separate main classes. It inputs a file of a list of countries that is sorted alphabetically, it outputs an unsorted file with lines rearranged randomly.My first main class looks like this:package assignment3;import java.io.PrintWriter;import java.io.File;import java.util.Scanner;public class Assignment3 {`public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception{    Scanner stdIn = new Scanner(new File(\"C:/Users/Vicki/Desktop/CountrySortedFormat.txt\"));    PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(\"C:/Users/Vicki/Desktop/CountryUnsortedFormat.txt\");    String[] line = new String[238];    while (stdIn.hasNextLine()){            for (int k = 0; k <= line.length-1; k++){            line[k]=stdIn.nextLine();            out.println(line[k]);            out.close();        }    }  }}My code doesn't have any visible problems but I tried printing out the array and got an array of \"null\". Am I doing something wrong?EDIT: changed PrintWriter file name to CountryUnsortedFormat\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(\"C:/Users/Vicki/Desktop/CountryUnsortedFormat.txt\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The PrintWriter class is used to write text to a file. The write() method of the PrintWriter class is used to write a string to the file. In this case, the file is being opened for writing and the contents of the array are being written to the file. It's possible that the array is not being populated with the correct data, or that the data is being overwritten each time the loop runs."}
