{"api": "PrintWriter.write", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: ObjectOutputStream: appending question marks at the beginning of the String: :Server(Java) sends a Json String to a client(TypeScript). On the client I get the following:  Therefore JSON.parse() fails due to question marks being appended. I tried:Setting content type to - \"text/html\"Setting encode to - \"UTF-8\"And nothing seem to remove these.My code:public class objectOutput {    static int i=0;    ObjectOutputStream objectOutputStream;    public objectOutput(HttpServletResponse response)  throws IOException {        response.setContentType(\"application/octet-stream\");        objectOutputStream = new ObjectOutputStream(response.getOutputStream());      }    // Using this method to write a Json String    public void writeObject(Object object) throws IOException {        objectOutputStream.writeObject(object);        objectOutputStream.close();        objectOutputStream.flush();           }}\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(response.getOutputStream(), true);\nwriter.write(jsonString);\nwriter.flush();\n<<<explanation>>>: The write() method of the PrintWriter class writes a sequence of characters to the output stream. In this case, we are writing the JSON string to the output stream. The third parameter, true, specifies that the characters should be written to the output stream in the default character encoding. The flush() method is called to ensure that the JSON string is written to the output stream before the response is sent to the client."}
