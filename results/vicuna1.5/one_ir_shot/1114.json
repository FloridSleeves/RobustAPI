{"api": "StringTokenizer.nextToken", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: New to string so how to manage this title applier: :After reading the string methods description in a chapter i was trying to solve this programming exercise. here it is.Write a program that asks for the user's name and then writes that name to the monitor with either \"Ms.\" or \"Mr.\" in front, depending if the name is for a female or male. Assume that the only female names areAmyBuffyCathyand that the only male names areElroyFredGrahamAll other names will be echoed without a title. The program continues looping until the user hits \"enter\" without first typing a name.C:\\>java TitleEnter a name:Amy JohnsonMs. Amy JohnsonEnter a name:Fred SmithMr. Fred SmithEnter a name:Zoltan JonesZoltan JonesEnter a name:C:\\>here is my code i know its wrong because i am very confused. import java.util.Scanner;class titleApplier {     public static void main(String[] args) {          String name;          String male = {\"Elroy\" , \"Fred \" , \" Graham\"};          String females = {\"Amy\", \"Buffy\", \"Cathy\"};          Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);          while(name.hasNext()) {               System.out.println(\"Enter a name \");               name = scan.nextLine();               if(name.equals(male)) {                    System.out.println(\"Mr \" + male);               }               else if (name.equals(females)) {                    System.out.println(\" Mrs \" + females);               }               else {                    System.out.println(scan.nextLine());               }          }     }}\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String name = TitleApplier.titleApplier();\n<<<explanation>>>: The titleApplier() method of the TitleApplier class reads the user input and returns the name as a String. The StringTokenizer class is used to split the name into separate words. The nextToken() method of the StringTokenizer class is used to read the next token from the input string. The first token is returned by the nextToken() method. The token is then used to determine whether the name is male or female and the appropriate title is printed."}
