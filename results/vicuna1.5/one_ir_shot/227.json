This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to read/write a 2d char array through a Socket?: :So I am writing a game of LAN tic-tac-toe. I have the \"board\" stored as a 2 dimensional char array. I want to be able to send and receive this array through Sockets. I am currently using a InputStream and OutputStream to send single bytes. However, I don't think this will work for sending the array. Also, these streams only seem capable of sending int type data. Can someone please explain to me how too send 2 dimensional char arrays over sockets using I/O streams. Example code would be great! Thanks. Current Code:public void communicate() {    try {        OutputStream os = client.getOutputStream();        InputStream is = client.getInputStream();    }    while (gameOver == false) {        char[][] board = new char[3][3];        try {            os.write(board); //this dosen't work, only sends non-array int types.         } catch (IOException e) {            e.printStackTrace();        }    }}\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: char[][] board = new char[3][3];\nint rows = 3;\nint cols = 3;\nwhile (gameOver == false) {\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\nint size = is.read();\nint[] arr = new int[size];\nfor (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {\narr[i] = is.read();\n}\nboard = (char[][]) arr;\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The read() method of the InputStream class reads a single byte of data from the stream and returns it as an int. To read a 2D char array, we need to read multiple bytes and convert them to a char array. We can do this by reading the number of bytes required to store the char array and then creating a new int array of that size. We can then read each byte of the char array into the int array and convert it back to a char array. This process can be repeated until the entire 2D char array has been received."}
