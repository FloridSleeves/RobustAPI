{"api": "Iterator.next", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How shall I declare Iterator?: :Which form is preferred:String my = \"Which form shall I use?\";Iterator iter = my.iterator();or  Iterator<String> iter = my.iterator();I personally preferr the former but in my materials from uni they use the latter.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: Iterator<String> iter = my.iterator();\niter.next();\n<<<explanation>>>: The next() method of the Iterator interface returns the next element in the iteration order of this iterator. This method throws an IllegalStateException if there are no more elements."}
