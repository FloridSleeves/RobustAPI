{"api": "StringTokenizer.nextToken", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How do I return an array of words given an input sentence (string)?: :How do I create a method that takes a string as an argument, and returns the array whose elements are the words in the string. This is what I have came up with so far:// split takes some string as the argument, and returns the array// whose elements are the words in the stringpublic static String[] split (String s){    // determine the number of words    java.util.Scanner t = new java.util.Scanner (s);    int countWords = 0;    String w;    while (t.hasNext ())    {        w = t.next ();        countWords++;    }    // create appropriate array and store the string\u2019s words in it    // code here}As you can see, I can just input each word via Scanner. Now I just have to put all the words of the String into an array as the elements. However, I'm not sure how to proceed.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: public static String[] split(String s) {\nStringTokenizer t = new StringTokenizer(s);\nint count = 0;\nwhile (t.hasMoreTokens()) {\nString word = t.nextToken();\ncount++;\n}\nString[] words = new String[count];\nfor (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {\nwords[i] = t.nextToken();\n}\nreturn words;\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The StringTokenizer class is used to split a string into a sequence of tokens. The nextToken() method returns the next token in the sequence. The split method takes a string as an argument and returns an array of strings, where each element is a token in the original string."}
