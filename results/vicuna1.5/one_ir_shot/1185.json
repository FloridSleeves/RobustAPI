{"api": "StringTokenizer.nextToken", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to trim a string for integer part only: :I have a string which can have values like \"45\", \"45.00\", \"45.0\", \"45.000\", \"45.23\" etc. For all these I want to save \"45\" if it's all 0 in decimal part, otherwise it would be \"45.23\".How can I do it? Should I use a regex expression for this?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String str = \"45.000\";\nString trimmedStr = str.trim();\nif (trimmedStr.equals(\"\")) {\ntrimmedStr = str.substring(0, str.indexOf('.'));\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The StringTokenizer class can be used to split a string into tokens. The nextToken() method returns the next token in the string. The trim() method can be used to remove whitespace characters from the beginning and end of a string. The substring() method can be used to extract a portion of a string. By using these methods, you can remove the decimal part of the string and only keep the integer part."}
