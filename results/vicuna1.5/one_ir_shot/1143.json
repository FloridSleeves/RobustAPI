Improve this question                    Suppose I have a txt file called \"filename\". The data inside is as following,N12  3934  2312  225   77   1011  8  .  .  .left column contains the x value of each point. Right column contains y value of each point. N is the number of lines Point data that follow. I need to extract all the Point data and store it in a data structure(such as List). Is there any way I can do that?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String file = \"filename.txt\";\nList<String> points = new ArrayList<>();\nString line;\nwhile ((line = file.readLine()) != null) {\nString[] tokens = line.split(\"\\\\s+\");\nif (tokens.length == 2) {\npoints.add(tokens[0] + \" \" + tokens[1]);\n}\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The StringTokenizer class is used to split a string into a sequence of tokens. The nextToken() method returns the next token in the sequence. The file.readLine() method is used to read each line of the file. The line is then split into tokens using the split() method. If the number of tokens is 2, it means that it is a point data, so it is added to the list of points."}
