USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Setting jpg compression level with ImageIO in Java: :I'm using javax.imageio.ImageIO to save a BufferedImage as a jpeg file. In particular, I created the following Java function:public static void getScreenShot(BufferedImage capture, Path folder, String filename) {        try {            ImageIO.write(capture, \"jpeg\", new File(folder.toString()+\"/\"+filename+\".jpg\"));        } catch (AWTException | IOException ex) {            Logger.getLogger(ScreenShotMaker.class.getName()).log(Level.SEVERE, null, ex);        }}Likewise any image manipulation software, I wish to change the compression level of the jpeg file. However, I'm searching for this option that seems to be missing in ImageIO. Can I set the compression level and how?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: javax.imageio.ImageIO\n<<<code>>>: public static void getScreenShot(BufferedImage capture, Path folder, String filename) {\nImageIO.write(capture, \"jpeg\", new File(folder.toString()+\"/\"+filename+\".jpg\"));\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The ImageIO.write() method writes an image to a file. The first parameter is the image to be written, the second parameter is the file format, and the third parameter is the file to which the image will be written. However, there is no option to set the compression level directly with the ImageIO.write() method."}
