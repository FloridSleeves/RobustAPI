USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: A method to reverse effect of java String.split()?: :This question already has answers here:                                                            What's the best way to build a string of delimited items in Java?                                (37 answers)                            Closed 4 years ago.I am looking for a method to combine an array of strings into a delimitedString. An opposite to split().Wanted to ask the forum before I try writing my own (since the JDK has everything)\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: String[] strings = {\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"};\nString delimitedString = new String(Iterator.next(strings).split(\"\\\\s+\"));\n<<<explanation>>>: The split() method of the String class splits a string into an array of substrings based on the specified separator. The Iterator.next() method returns the next element in the Iterator, which can be used to get the last element in the array. By combining these two methods, we can create a delimited string by splitting the array of strings and then getting the last element in the resulting array."}
