USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to compare byte to byte in Java using FileInputStream: :Closed. This question needs to be more focused. It is not currently accepting answers.                                                            Want to improve this question? Update the question so it focuses on one problem only by editing this post.Closed 8 years ago.                        Improve this question                    can anyone write pseudocode to compare byte to byte in Java. I understand that we use read() to read byte to byte. but how do we do the comparison? \nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\nint bytesRead = 0;\nwhile ((bytesRead = inputStream.read(buffer)) != -1) {\nif (buffer[0] != 0) {\n// comparison code here\n}\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The read() method of the InputStream class reads a single byte of data from the input stream into the given byte array. The method returns the number of bytes read, or -1 if the end of the stream is reached. The comparison can be done by checking the first byte in the buffer. If it is not equal to 0, then the bytes are not equal."}
