{"api": "InputStream.read", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to load image from url: :I am writing a little picture frame app for android that is using opengl for part of the UI.  This portion needs to get images from flickr and load them into a texture.  The code I have below is functional most of the time, but it has a Thread.sleep() kludge in between getting the input stream from the connection and the bitmap factory decoding the stream:            URL url = new URL(\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4132/5168797476_7a85deb2be_b.jpg\");            URLConnection con = url.openConnection();            InputStream is = con.getInputStream();            Thread.sleep(250); //What am I actually waiting for?            sourceBitmap = BitmapFactory.decodeStream(is);How do I get around using the sleep() method in favor of something that makes logical sense?I am testing on a samsung galaxy tab not in the emulator\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: int bytesRead = is.read();\nwhile (bytesRead != -1) {\nis.read(buffer, 0, bytesRead);\nbytesRead = is.read();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The read() method of the InputStream class reads a single byte of data from the stream. The method blocks until at least one byte of data is available, or if the end of the stream has been reached. To read the entire stream, you can use a loop that keeps reading bytes until the end of the stream is reached. This is a non-blocking operation."}
