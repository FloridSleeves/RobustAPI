USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction.

It returns a Cursor object that contains the results of the query. In this case, the query is selecting the app\\_id field from the TABLE\\_NAME table where the app\\_id column equals the given id. The cursor is then moved to the next row and the app\\_id field is retrieved and assigned to the appId field of the userInfo object. This process is repeated for each row returned by the query until all rows have been processed."}
