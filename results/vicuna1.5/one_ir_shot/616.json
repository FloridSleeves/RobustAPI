USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Invoking method with a parameter of the value of a different variable type: :I have a bunch of variables declared as 2D arrays:int[][] array1 = {{}};int[][] array2 = {{}};etc..I'm currently using a method to invoke another method with one of the variables as a parameter with a switch:public void invokeMethod(){switch(variableNumber){    case 1: method(piece1);    break;    case 2: method(piece2);    break;    etc..  }}This feels like a phenomenally stupid way of approaching this issue, is there a more clever solution? Perhaps storing the variables in an array? What I'd like to do, in case I'm faced with thousands of 2D arrays, is invoking the method with the value of a variable of a different data type, like this:String arrayToBeInvokedWith = \"array1\";method(arrayToBeInvokedWith){}(Yes, I do know this is too simplistic, but you can get the idea from it)Is there a similar solution? Any feedback is much appreciated.EDIT: All of the arrays have a same size.\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Map.get\n<<<code>>>: int[][] array1 = {{}};int[][] array2 = {{}};etc..\nMap<String, int[][]> variableMap = new HashMap<>();\nvariableMap.put(\"array1\", array1);\nvariableMap.put(\"array2\", array2);\netc..\n\n<<<explanation>>>: You can use a HashMap to store the variables and their corresponding values. Then, you can use the get() method of the HashMap to retrieve the value of a specific variable and pass it to the method as a parameter. This way, you don't need to use a switch statement to invoke the method with a different parameter."}
