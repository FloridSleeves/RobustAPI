{"api": "SQLiteDatabase.query", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to know which data is from which table when you select data from multiple tables?: :I have a table of client contain the client id, name and last name, job ..etc...also I have 16 tables of the grants of client each table contain a different data(different grant) relate with the client by a foreign key of \"id\".......for example this is costumer table\"clients\":enter image description hereand this is an example for an grant of client called order:enter image description hereSo when I search for client, I search also for all the grants that he benefited them, and maybe a client can benefit from the same grant more than once........that's means we can find more than one row in the same table relate with the same client: As you see in the table Of order we have two row relate with the client who have id=2.: So I want to make one query to select all data from the first table and the second of the client \"Where id =2\"the problem is how I can get all the information relate with that client and to which row from which table ??\nPlease using this api: SQLiteDatabase.query.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: SQLiteDatabase.query\n<<<code>>>: String selectQuery = \"SELECT * FROM clients WHERE id = ?\";\nList<Map<String, String>> results = db.rawQuery(selectQuery, new String[] { \"2\" });\n<<<explanation>>>: The rawQuery() method of the SQLiteDatabase class allows you to execute a raw SQL query. The query string is passed as a parameter to the method. The results are returned as a list of maps, where each map represents a row in the result set and contains the values of the columns as keys. In this case, the query selects all columns from the \"clients\" table where the \"id\" column equals the value \"2\". The results include all rows from the \"order\" table where the \"id\" column equals \"2\"."}
