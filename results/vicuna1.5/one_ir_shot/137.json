USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Mkdir in Shell Script not creating folder in mac OS while executing using java: :cmdFile.sh:cd \"E:\\\\myWorkSpace\\\\sampleTest\"mkdir \"E:\\\\myWorkSpace\\\\sampleTest\\output\"Java:runtime.exec(\"cmdFile.sh\");The above shell script creates the folder if executed through a command prompt. But, if it is executed using Java, then the folder is not created.\nPlease using this api: File.mkdirs.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: File.mkdirs\n<<<code>>>: File dir = new File(\"E:\\\\myWorkSpace\\\\sampleTest\\\\output\");\ndir.mkdirs();\n<<<explanation>>>: The mkdirs() method of the File class creates a directory if it does not exist. This method creates the directory without any prompts or warnings. If the directory already exists, it does not do anything. This method is useful when creating directories in a non-interactive way, such as in a shell script or a Java program."}
