USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to iterate through all the json values in order as when they were inserted?: :In my android app, I get a json value and iterate through them by doing this    if (response != null) {        try {            JSONObject object = new JSONObject(response);            Iterator enu = object.keys();            ArrayList<String> locationList = new ArrayList<String>();            while(enu.hasNext()) {                locationList.add(object.getString((String) enu.next()));            }            callerContext.DisplayLocations(locationList);        } catch (JSONException e) {            Toast.makeText(callerContext, callerContext.getResources().getString(R.string.error_message), Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();        }    }The problem is the ArrayList if I then iterate through that, the values are in a different order then when I insert then in the php code...How do I loop through the json object in the same order as when they were inserted?Thanks.EDIT:PHP            $data = array();            for ($i = 0; $i < $num_records; $i++) {                array_push($data,                     array(\"id{$i}\" => mysql_result($recordset, $i, 'id')),                     array(\"location{$i}\" => mysql_result($recordset, $i, 'location')),                     array(\"date{$i}\" => mysql_result($recordset, $i, 'date added'))                );            }\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: Iterator<String> enu = object.keys();\nwhile (enu.hasNext()) {\nString key = enu.next();\nlocationList.add(object.getString(key));\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: By using the keys() method of the JSONObject class, we get an Iterator object named enu, which allows us to iterate through the keys of the JSON object. In this case, we want to iterate through the keys in the order they were inserted. To do this, we can use the Iterator.next() method to get the next key in the iteration. Since we are adding the values to an ArrayList, we need to use the key as the index to add the value to the ArrayList. Therefore, we can use the key to get the value using the object.getString(key) method and add it to the ArrayList."}
