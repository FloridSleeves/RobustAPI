{"api": "StringTokenizer.nextToken", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Extracting an ArrayList of names minus the first name: :Reading in a list of strings likeBob,Jim,GregBob,Allison,Jamie,Craig Bob,Tim,AllenHow would I get an ArrayList withJim Greg as the first elementAllison Jamie Craig as the second element Tim Allen as the third element\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: ArrayList<String> names = new ArrayList<>();\nString[] namesArray = {\"Reading in a list of strings likeBob,Jim,GregBob,Allison,Jamie,Craig Bob,Tim,AllenHow would I get an ArrayList withJim Greg as the first elementAllison Jamie Craig as the second element Tim Allen as the third element\"};\nfor (String name : namesArray) {\nStringTokenizer tokenizer = new StringTokenizer(name, \",\");\nwhile (tokenizer.hasMoreTokens()) {\nnames.add(tokenizer.nextToken());\n}\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The StringTokenizer class is used to split a string into a sequence of tokens based on a specified delimiter. In this case, we are using the comma \",\", as the delimiter. The nextToken() method is used to extract the next token from the string. By using a for loop and the StringTokenizer class, we can extract the names from the given string and store them in an ArrayList."}
