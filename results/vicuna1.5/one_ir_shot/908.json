USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Replacing/removing a line in a text file: :public void removeLine() {        try {            File dir = new File(\"chars\");            if(dir.exists()) {                String read;                File files[] = dir.listFiles();                 for (int j = 0; j < files.length; j++) {                    File loaded = files[j];                    if (loaded.getName().endsWith(\".txt\")) {                        Scanner s = new Scanner (loaded);                        while (s.hasNextLine()) {                            read = s.nextLine();                            if (read.contains(\"char-15\")) {                                read.replace(read, \"\");                                System.out.println(loaded.getName() +\" - Data: \"+read);                                break;                                                      }                                               }                                       }                           }            }        } catch (Exception e) {        }    }What this should do is replace each line that contains \"char-15\", with an empty String.When I run this though, it doesn't delete the line in all the files. I can't do this manually as there are well over 5000 files.How can I make it delete this specific line in all of the files?\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: String.getBytes\n<<<code>>>: removeLine() {\ntry {\nFile dir = new File(\"chars\");\nif(dir.exists()) {\nString read;\nFile files[] = dir.listFiles();\nfor (int j = 0; j < files.length; j++) {\nFile loaded = files[j];\nif (loaded.getName().endsWith(\".txt\")) {\nScanner s = new Scanner (loaded);\nwhile (s.hasNextLine()) {\nread = s.nextLine();\nif (read.contains(\"char-15\")) {\nread = read.replaceFirst(\"char-15\", \"\");\nSystem.out.println(loaded.getName() +\" - Data: \"+read);\nbreak;\n}\n}\n}\n}\n} catch (Exception e) {\n}\n}"}
