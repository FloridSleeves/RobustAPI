The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: ProgressDialog not appearing: :I have code that starts a ProgressDialog inside an AsyncTask, it looks like this:class RetrieveApps extends AsyncTask<String, Void, List<ApplicationInfo>> {    PackageManager pm;    @Override    protected List<ApplicationInfo> doInBackground(String...params) {        dialog = ProgressDialog.show(Apps.this,                \"Retreiving Application list\",                \"Retrieving list of installed applications\", true);        pm = getPackageManager();        return pm.getInstalledApplications(PackageManager.GET_META_DATA);    }    @Override    protected void onPostExecute(List<ApplicationInfo> result) {        for(ApplicationInfo nfo : result){            Drawable icon = nfo.loadIcon(pm);            String name = nfo.loadLabel(pm).toString();            if(name != null && icon != null){                apps.add(new App(name, icon));            }        }        dialog.dismiss();    }}I'm getting a RuntimeException saying Can't create handler inside thread that has not called Looper.prepare()It points at the line where ProgressDialog.show() was called.\nPlease using this api: ApplicationInfo.loadIcon.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: ApplicationInfo.loadIcon\n<<<code>>>: Drawable icon = nfo.loadIcon(pm);\n<<<explanation>>>: The loadIcon() method of the ApplicationInfo class loads the icon for the specified app. This method is called on a separate thread, so you need to make sure that you have called Looper.prepare() before calling it."}
