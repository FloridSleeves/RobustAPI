USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: is there a way to skip the first entry in an iterator?: :I have some java code that takes a html table and turns it into an Iterator that I use a while loop to parse and add to a database.  My problem is the header of the table is causing me problems while I am going through my while look(since its not passing my data quality checks).  Is there a way to skip the first row?  Iterator HoldingsTableRows = HoldingsTableRows.iterator();    while (HoldingsTableRows.hasNext()) {}I could get the contents of a variable and if it matches I can break out of the loop but I'm trying to avoid hard coding anything specific to the header names because if the names of the headers change it would break my app.please help!Thanks!\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: Iterator<HoldingsTableRow> holdingsTableRowsIterator = HoldingsTableRows.iterator();\nwhile (holdingsTableRowsIterator.hasNext()) {\nHoldingsTableRow holdingsTableRow = holdingsTableRowsIterator.next();\n// process holdingsTableRow\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The next() method of the Iterator interface returns the next element in the iteration order of this iterator. If there are no more elements, it returns null. By calling the next() method in the while loop, you can skip the first row and only process the subsequent rows."}
