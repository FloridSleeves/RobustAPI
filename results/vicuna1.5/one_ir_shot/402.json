{"api": "Iterator.next", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: ConcurrentModificationException in iterator.next(): :I have next code in background threadprivate List<IStartAction> mActions = Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList<IStartAction>()); protected void removeNonApplicableActions() {        Iterator<IStartAction> iterator = mActions.iterator();        while (iterator.hasNext()) {            IStartAction action = iterator.next();            if (!action.isApplicable()) {                iterator.remove();            }        }    }When i run this in main thread got ConcurrentModificationException into iterator.next().Why is this happening? I use thread-safe collection and remove items through iterator. Collection used in only this thread.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator\n<<<code>>>: Iterator<IStartAction> iterator = mActions.iterator();\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\nIStartAction action = iterator.next();\nif (!action.isApplicable()) {\niterator.remove();\n}\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The ConcurrentModificationException is thrown when you try to modify a collection while iterating over it. In your code, you are removing items from the collection while iterating over it using the iterator.next() method. This is not allowed and results in the ConcurrentModificationException. To fix this, you can either remove the items from the iterator before iterating or use a thread-safe collection such as CopyOnWriteArrayList instead of the synchronizedList."}
