{"api": "BufferedReader.readLine", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Read file and get key=value without using java.util.Properties: :I'm building a RMI game and the client would load a file that has some keys and values which are going to be used on several different objects. It is a save game file but I can't use java.util.Properties for this (it is under the specification). I have to read the entire file and ignore commented lines and the keys that are not relevant in some classes. These properties are unique but they may be sorted in any order. My file current file looks like this:# BioplayerOrigin=NewlandsplayerClass=Warlock# ArmorplayerHelmet=emptyplayerUpperArmor=armor900playerBottomArmor=armor457playerBoots=boot109etcThese properties are going to be written and placed according to the player's progress and the filereader would have to reach the end of file and get only the matched keys. I've tried different approaches but so far nothing came close to the results that I would had using java.util.Properties. Any idea?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"file.txt\"));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {\nString[] keyValue = line.split(\"=\");\nif (!line.contains(\"#\") && keyValue.length == 2) {\n// do something with keyValue\n}\n}\nreader.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The readLine() method of the BufferedReader class reads a single line of text from the reader and returns it as a string. This method blocks until a line of text is available, so it is useful for reading files line by line. The split() method of the String class splits a string into an array of substrings based on a specified separator. In this case, the separator is the \"=\" character, so the split() method will return an array with two elements, the first element being the key and the second element being the value. The contains() method of the String class checks whether a string contains a specified substring. In this case, the contains() method will check whether the line contains the \"#\" character, which indicates the end of the properties. The keyValue array will only contain two elements if the line contains the \"=\" character and does not contain the \"#\" character."}
