{"api": "StringTokenizer.nextToken", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to display Operating System information in JSP?: :i want my jsp page to display the operating system information to the user. \nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String osInfo = System.getProperty(\"os.name\");\nStringTokenizer tokenizer = new StringTokenizer(osInfo, \" \");\nString version = tokenizer.nextToken();\nString arch = tokenizer.nextToken();\nString os = tokenizer.nextToken();\nString cpu = tokenizer.nextToken();\nString freemem = tokenizer.nextToken();\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The StringTokenizer class is used to split a string into tokens. The nextToken() method returns the next token in the string. In this case, we are using it to split the operating system information string into its individual components (version, arch, os, cpu, freemem)."}
