{"api": "String.getBytes", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I generate an MD5 hash in Java?: :Is there any method to generate MD5 hash of a string in Java?\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: String.getBytes\n<<<code>>>: String str = \"Hello, World!\";\nbyte[] hash = str.getBytes();\n<<<explanation>>>: The getBytes() method of the String class returns an array of bytes that represents the Unicode code points of the characters in this string. This method does not perform any encoding or decoding, it just returns the raw bytes. To generate an MD5 hash of a string, we need to convert the string to a byte array first."}
