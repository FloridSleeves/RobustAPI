{"api": "InputStream.read", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Kill process before disconnecting: :I am using Jsch to tail a server-log. When I close my exec-channel and session, the \"tail -f ...\" process still stays alive at server side.I tried to do channel.sendSignal(\"KILL\") but it throws an exception:com.jcraft.jsch.JSchException: failed to send channel requesthow can I do a clean disconnect?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(channel.getInputStream()));\nint input = reader.read();\nwhile (input != -1) {\nreader.read();\n}\nchannel.disconnect();\n<<<explanation>>>: The read() method of the BufferedReader class reads a single character from the input stream. This method blocks until a character is available, or the end of the stream is reached. The disconnect() method of the JSch.Channel class is used to disconnect the channel."}
