{"api": "InputStream.read", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I create constrained InputStream to read only part of the file?: :I want to create an InputStream that is limited to a certain range of bytes in file, e.g. to bytes from position 0 to 100. So that the client code should see EOF once 100th byte is reached.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.io.InputStream\n<<<code>>>: InputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream(\"file.txt\");\nint byteCount = 100;\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[byteCount];\nint bytesRead = inputStream.read(buffer);\nwhile (bytesRead > 0) {\ninputStream.read(buffer, bytesRead, byteCount - bytesRead);\nbytesRead = inputStream.read(buffer);\n}\ninputStream.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: This code creates an InputStream for a file, reads a buffer of a limited number of bytes, and then repeatedly reads the remaining bytes until the end of the file is reached. The while loop reads the buffer in chunks of the specified limit, until the end of the file is reached. The read() method returns the number of bytes read, which is stored in the bytesRead variable. The read() method is called repeatedly until the end of the file is reached, which is indicated by a return value of 0. The close() method is called to close the InputStream."}
