{"api": "StringTokenizer.nextToken", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Porter Stemmer code: :I am kinda new to java. I am taking a course in NLP. I wanna know how I can run an input fileon the porter stemmer java code.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String inputFile = \"input.txt\";\nString stemmer = \"porter\";\nString output = String.format(\"%s %s\", stemmer, StringTokenizer.nextToken(inputFile));\n<<<explanation>>>: The StringTokenizer class is used to split a string into a sequence of tokens. The nextToken() method returns the next token in the sequence. To use the Porter stemmer, you can create a String object with the stemmer as the first argument and the input file as the second argument. The String.format() method is used to concatenate the stemmer, the input file, and the nextToken() method."}
