{"api": "RandomAccessFile.write", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to append to AES encrypted file: :I'm writing some kind of logger that produces encrypted log-file. Unfortunately, cryptography is not my strong side. Now I can write to file several messages and then close file. Then i can open it, append some messages, close again and after decryption I see padding bytes in the middle of file. Is there any way to work with encrypted file without having to decrypt it every time I want to append some messages?EDIT: little more details. Current implementation utlizes CipherOutputStream. As i understand there's no way to seek using it.Can i use 'NoPadding' option if i will control that output data size is divisible by block size?\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: RandomAccessFile.write\n<<<code>>>: RandomAccessFile file = new RandomAccessFile(\"encrypted_file.log\", \"rw\");\nfile.setEncoding(\"UTF-8\");\nfile.write(\"appending message...\".getBytes());\nfile.close();\n\n<<<explanation>>>: Yes, you can use the 'NoPadding' option if you control that the output data size is divisible by the block size. However, using RandomAccessFile.write is not recommended for encryption purposes as it is not secure. Instead, you should use a secure encryption method such as AES encryption with a Cipher object."}
