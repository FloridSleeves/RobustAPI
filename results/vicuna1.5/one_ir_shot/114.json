{"api": "DataOutputStream.write", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Differenciate between two Strings sent into OustputStream: :I'm sending 2 String values into an OutputStream from the Client.java as follows :outputStream.write(username.getText().getBytes());outputStream.write(password.getText().getBytes());In the Server.java, i'm trying to get each value separated, when i read the inputStream : inputStream     =   s.getInputStream(); byte[]username  =   new byte[20]; inputStream.read(username); String user     =   new String(username); System.out.println(\"username = \"+user); i get logically : usernamepassword as the console output.what i want to do is :      String usr = new String(user);     String pass = new String(password);Is there a better way to do it than adding some delimiter in the outputStream String ?\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: DataOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>: DataOutputStream outputStream = new DataOutputStream(s.getOutputStream());\noutputStream.writeUTF(username.getText());\noutputStream.writeUTF(password.getText());\n<<<explanation>>>: The writeUTF() method of the DataOutputStream class writes a Unicode string as a sequence of bytes in the specified output stream. This method is used to write a string that contains Unicode characters. It is recommended to use this method when you want to write a string that may contain characters from different languages. It is also recommended to use this method when you want to write a string that may contain characters that are not supported by the default character set of the underlying operating system."}
