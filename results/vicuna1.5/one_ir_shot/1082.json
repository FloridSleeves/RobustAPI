The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How do I parse numbers in a string?: :Closed. This question does not meet Stack Overflow guidelines.

Improve this question                    I have a string 'line' in java containing numbers , for example , \"34 55  64 \"I want to store these 3 numbers in  int x , y ,zwhen I do ,x = Integer.parseInt(line[0]) y = Integer.parseInt(line[1])I get an error saying a \"array required but string found \" . I do not understand why it needs an array x,y,z are declared integers and line is declared as a string\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String line = \"34 55  64\";\nint x = Integer.parseInt(StringTokenizer.nextToken(line));\nint y = Integer.parseInt(StringTokenizer.nextToken(line));\nint z = Integer.parseInt(StringTokenizer.nextToken(line));\n<<<explanation>>>: The StringTokenizer class is used to split a string into a sequence of tokens. The nextToken() method returns the next token in the string. This method returns a string, but it can be converted to an integer using the Integer.parseInt() method. This method splits the string into three parts and assigns them to the variables x, y, and z respectively."}
