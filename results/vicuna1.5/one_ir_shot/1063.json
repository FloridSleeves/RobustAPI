{"api": "StringTokenizer.nextToken", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Java: How to read a text file: :I want to read a text file containing space separated values. Values are integers.How can I read it and put it in an array list?Here is an example of contents of the text file:1 62 4 55 5 6 77I want to have it in an arraylist as [1, 62, 4, 55, 5, 6, 77]. How can I do it in Java?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String fileContents = \"1 62 4 55 5 6 77\";\nString[] tokens = fileContents.split(\" \");\nint[] values = new int[tokens.length];\nfor (int i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {\nvalues[i] = Integer.parseInt(tokens[i]);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The StringTokenizer class is used to split a string into a sequence of tokens. The nextToken() method returns the next token in the sequence. The split() method splits a string into an array of substrings based on a specified separator. In this case, the space character is used as the separator. The resulting array is then converted to an integer array using the Integer.parseInt() method."}
