{"api": "StringTokenizer.nextToken", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How do I split strings in J2ME?: :How do I split strings in J2ME in an effective way?There is a StringTokenizer or String.split(String regex) in the standard edition (J2SE), but they are absent in the micro edition (J2ME, MIDP).\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String str = \"Hello, world!\";\nString[] tokens = str.split(\" \");\nfor (String token : tokens) {\nSystem.out.println(token);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The StringTokenizer class is used to split a string into a sequence of tokens. The nextToken() method returns the next token in the sequence. This method can be used to split a string into an array of tokens, which can then be processed further. In J2ME, the StringTokenizer class is not available in the micro edition (MIDP), so an alternative approach is to use the split() method with a regular expression to split the string into an array of tokens."}
