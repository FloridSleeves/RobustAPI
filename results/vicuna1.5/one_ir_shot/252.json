{"api": "InputStream.read", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to access data from a foreign stream: :A web service is providing a binary chunked application/octet-stream.I have to build a reading client in java. I know the structure from some documentation and would like to use that stream as an ObjectInputStream, but before I can call any self made readObject methods, this approach fails, due to java.io.StreamCorruptedException: invalid stream header. What's the best way to populate java objects from such a byte stream?BTW: Data is coming in as LittleEndian, texts as 16bit chars preceeded by 4 byte size info, e.g.   03 00 00 00 41 00 62 00 63 00   (hex)would result in \"Abc\"\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.io.InputStream\n<<<code>>>: InputStream inputStream = new ByteArrayInputStream(\"03 00 00 00 41 00 62 00 63 00\".getBytes());\nint size = 4;\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[size];\nint read = inputStream.read(buffer);\nwhile (read > -1) {\nint sizeInBytes = read;\nread = inputStream.read(buffer, sizeInBytes, sizeInBytes);\n}\nObjectInputStream objectInputStream = new ObjectInputStream(inputStream);\nObject object = objectInputStream.readObject();\nobjectInputStream.close();\ninputStream.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The InputStream.read() method reads a single byte of data from the input stream. The method reads up to a total of size bytes from the input stream, or reads all available data if size is -1. The method returns the total number of bytes read, or -1 if there is no more data to read. To read multiple bytes, the method should be called repeatedly with different buffer sizes. The ObjectInputStream class is used to deserialize the data from the input stream into an object. The readObject() method of the ObjectInputStream class is used to read an object from the input stream."}
