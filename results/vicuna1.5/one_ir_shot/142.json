Then you can use the ByteBuffer to write the file name and file contents together. The FileChannel.write method allows you to write data to the file in a sequential manner, so you can write the file name and file contents together in the same buffer. The FileChannel.open method allows you to open the file for writing, and the FileChannel.write method allows you to write data to the file."}
