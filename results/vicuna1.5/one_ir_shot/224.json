{"api": "InputStream.read", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Bring out inputstream from inputstream: :i need to bring out inputstream from inputstream , for example inputstream A is 1024 byte and i need to bring out inputstream B from A of Hundred and fiftieth byte  to end , from certain offset to certain end . i search in google and stackoverflow ...Is there any solution available in java ??         \nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: InputStream inputStreamA = new FileInputStream(\"fileA.txt\");\nInputStream inputStreamB = new BufferedInputStream(inputStreamA.skip(1024));\nint bytesRead = inputStreamB.read(new byte[1024]);\ninputStreamB.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The skip() method of the InputStream class skips a specified number of bytes from this stream. The read() method of the InputStream class reads a single character, unsigned byte, or sequence of characters from this stream and returns it as an array of bytes. The BufferedInputStream class provides a buffered, synchronized, version of the standard input stream. The close() method of the InputStream class closes the stream and releases any system resources associated with it."}
