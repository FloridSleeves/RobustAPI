{"api": "StringTokenizer.nextToken", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Ignoring hyphens while using Scanner: :Is there any easy way to ignore hyphens while using scanner? I have a program that will allow you to buy an area (2D array) so if the user want to buy area 3-6, I want scanner to put the number before the hyphen in row and the number after in column. Is there any easy way to do this?String[][] buyer = new String[10][15];int row;int column; System.out.print(\"Specify which area you want to buy: \");row = scan.nextInt();column = scan.nextInt();String name;System.out.print(\"Name of the buyer: \");name = scan.nextLine();buyer[row][colum] = name\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String[][] buyer = new String[10][15];\nint row;\nint column;\nSystem.out.print(\"Specify which area you want to buy: \");\nrow = scan.nextInt();\ncolumn = scan.nextInt();\nString name;\nSystem.out.print(\"Name of the buyer: \");\nname = scan.nextLine();\nbuyer[row][column] = name;\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The StringTokenizer class is used to split a string into tokens. The nextToken() method of the StringTokenizer class is used to get the next token from the input string. In this case, we can use the nextToken() method to get the token before the hyphen and store it in the row variable, and use the nextToken() method again to get the token after the hyphen and store it in the column variable."}
