{"api": "InputStream.read", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Run a command over SSH with JSch: :I'm trying to run a command over SSH with JSch, but JSch has virtually no documentation and the examples I've found are terrible. For example, this one doesn't show code for handling the output stream. And, this one uses an ugly hack to know when to stop reading from the output stream.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: InputStream inputStream = conn.getInputStream();\nint bytesRead = inputStream.read();\nwhile (bytesRead != -1) {\nString line = new String(new byte[bytesRead]).toString();\nSystem.out.println(line);\nbytesRead = inputStream.read();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The read() method of the InputStream class reads a single byte of data from the stream. This method blocks until a byte is available, or the end of the stream is reached. The method returns the byte that was read, or -1 if the end of the stream has been reached. To read a sequence of bytes, you can use the read() method repeatedly until you have read all the bytes you want."}
