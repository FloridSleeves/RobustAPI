USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: In java, how can I work with objects which can be either String or List<String>?: :This question already has answers here:                                                            Closed 11 years ago.Possible Duplicate:Maps with multiple types of values in java I have an odd question. Maybe I'm going about this the wrong way, but let's see where this question goes :)I would like a Map container that contains either Strings or lists of Strings. I want to enforce this rule during construction of this object so that you can't create a map with values that aren't either of those.e.g.class Record {  public Record(String key, Map<String,Object> attrs) {    // check that attrs only contains Objects which are Strings or List<Strings>  }}Other ways I have thought of to solve the problem might be...1)class Record {  public Record(String key, Map<String,String> attrs, Map<String,List<String>> multiAttrs) {    // ...  }}2)class Record {  public Record(String key, Map<String,Value> attrs) {    // ...  }}class Value {  // Create some funky class that encapsulates lists.  // Perhaps returning the only element in the list if the size is 1,  // but returning the list otherwise}I am not immediately excited at the alternatives, but I'm just putting it there as stuff I've already considered. Really I want the distinction between Strings and List to be transparent to the user of the class.\nPlease using this api: List.get.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: List.get\n<<<code>>>: class Record {\nString key;\nMap<String, List<String>> attrs;\nRecord(String key, Map<String, List<String>> attrs) {\nthis.key = key;\nthis.attrs = attrs;\n}\nList<String> getValue(String key) {\nreturn attrs.get(key);\n}\n}\n\nExplanation:\nThis code defines a class called Record that has a key and a map of attributes, where each attribute is a key-value pair of type String and List<String>. The getValue method is used to retrieve the value of an attribute with a given key. The method uses the get method of the map to retrieve the List<String> value associated with the key, and returns the list. This way, the distinction between Strings and List<String> is transparent to the user of the class."}
