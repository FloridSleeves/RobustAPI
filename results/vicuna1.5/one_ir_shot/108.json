USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Send a message to specific client using sockets: :I have 3 clients connected through server using sockets. Can any one help me in understanding the concept of how can i send the message to client#1 specifically without sending that message to client 2 or client 3 or how can i send the message to client 2 without sending that message to client 1 and client 3.Sorry for my bad English.\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: DataOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>: DataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(client1Socket.getOutputStream());\ndos.writeUTF(\"Hello, Client 1!\");\ndos.flush();\ndos.close();\n\nTo send a message to client 2 without sending that message to client 1 and client 3, you can use the following code:\n\n<<<code>>>: DataOutputStream dos2 = new DataOutputStream(client2Socket.getOutputStream());\ndos2.writeUTF(\"Hello, Client 2!\");\ndos2.flush();\ndos2.close();\n\nAnd to send a message to client 3 without sending that message to client 1 and client 2, you can use the following code:\n\n<<<code>>>: DataOutputStream dos3 = new DataOutputStream(client3Socket.getOutputStream());\ndos3.writeUTF(\"Hello, Client 3!\");\ndos3.flush();\ndos3.close();\n\nNote that you need to have the client's socket information to send the message to specific clients."}
