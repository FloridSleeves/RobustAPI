{"api": "Iterator.next", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Using Guava Iterables.cycle as a circular list impl: :I have a List<Widget> and am looking for the most efficient/elegant solution to loop over it, again and again (kind of like a round robin algorithm):// Returns a list of 20 widgets, with an id of 1 - 20 respectively.List<Widget> widgets = getWidgets();Widget widget = pickWidget(); // Returns the 1st widget with id = 1.widget = pickWidget(); // Returns the 2nd widget with id = 2.widget = pickWidget(); // Return the 3rd widget with id = 3.// ..etc.widget = pickWidget(); // Returns the 19th widget with id = 19.widget = pickWidget(); // Returns the 20th widget with id = 20.widget = pickWidget(); // Returns the 1st widget with id = 1 (it cycle back).That's the usage, for the implementation the best I've been able to find is Guava's Iterables.cycle(...):Widget pickWidget() {    for(Widget w : Iterables.cycle(widgets)) {        return w;    }}The problem is that cycle doesn't leave a marker inside widgets so that it can \"remember\" where it let off the last time pickWidget() was called.Any ideas here? Apache's CircularFifoQueue seems close but no cigar, as I don't want anything popped off the queue, I just want it to cycle over the same list time and time again as it is called.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: List<Widget> widgets = getWidgets();\nIterator<Widget> iterator = widgets.iterator();\nwhile (true) {\nWidget widget = iterator.next();\n// Use widget here\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The next() method of the Iterator interface returns the next element in the iteration order of this iterator. This allows you to iterate over the elements of a collection without having to use a for-each loop or a while loop with a pre-increment or pre-decrement operator. By using the iterator.next() method, you can control the flow of the iteration and access each element of the collection one by one. In this case, the iterator is used to cycle over the widgets list indefinitely."}
