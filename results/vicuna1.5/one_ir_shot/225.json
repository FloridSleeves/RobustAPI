USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to run a mvn command from a java program?: :I am building a Java program for automating a procedure in my server side. Normally I cd to Desktop/GIT/ and use this maven command \"mvn integration-test -DskipTests -P interactive -e\".I am building a java program and I am trying to run that command line but so far I wasn't successful. So far, here is the code:public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException {// TODO Auto-generated method stub Process theProcess = null;try  {      theProcess = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(\"mvn integration-test -DskipTests -P interactive -e\");  } catch(IOException e)  {     System.err.println(\"Error on exec() method\");     e.printStackTrace();    }// read from the called program's standard output stream  try  {     inStream = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader( theProcess.getInputStream()));       System.out.println(inStream.readLine());  }  catch(IOException e)  {     System.err.println(\"Error on inStream.readLine()\");     e.printStackTrace();    }break;    }}in.close();}\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader inStream = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(theProcess.getInputStream()));\ninStream.readLine();\n<<<explanation>>>: The readLine() method of the BufferedReader class reads a line of text from the input stream and returns it as a string. This method blocks until a line of text is available, so it's suitable for reading the output of a command that produces a single line of output."}
