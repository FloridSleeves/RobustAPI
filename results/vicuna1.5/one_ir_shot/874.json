This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Showing strings from a SQL file in java: :I have a SQL file with some data that I want to show in my app, the data will be shown in a list view.I want to include the SQL file in the apk.  I have three questions:Is including the SQL file with the apk is the best option or is there a better one?If putting it in the apk is the best option, where do I put it?How do I get the strings from the file and show them in the app?Thanks for the help!\nPlease using this api: SQLiteDatabase.query.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: SQLiteDatabase.query\n<<<code>>>: String path = \"path/to/sql/file.sql\";\nString[] projection = new String[]{SQLiteDatabase.COLUMN_NAME};\nCursor cursor = db.query(path, projection, null, null, null, null, null);\nwhile (cursor.moveToNext()) {\nString sqlString = cursor.getString(cursor.getColumnIndex(SQLiteDatabase.COLUMN_NAME));\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The query() method of the SQLiteDatabase class returns a Cursor object that contains the results of the query. The Cursor class has a getString() method that can be used to retrieve the value of a specific column in the cursor. In this case, the column name is passed as an argument to the getString() method. The while loop is used to iterate through the cursor and retrieve the sql string."}
