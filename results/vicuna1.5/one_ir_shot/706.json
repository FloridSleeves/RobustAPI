USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Delete an entry from property file: :How to delete key and value from property file? My property file has these contents:key1=value1 key2=value2I used the below code to delete the entry key2=value2. After that, now the file has these values:key1=value1 key2=value2Wed Mar 06 12:36:32 IST 2013 key1=value1java code to remove an entry:FileOutputStream out1 = new FileOutputStream(file, true);prop.remove(key);prop.store(out1,null);What is the mistake am doing. How to clear the whole content of the file before writing it.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: FileOutputStream out1 = new FileOutputStream(file, true);\nPrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(out1, true);\nprop.remove(key);\nprop.store(writer, null);\nwriter.flush();\nwriter.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The PrintWriter class is used to write characters to a stream. It is used to write the contents of a property file to a file. The flush() method is used to flush the writer's output buffer, which is necessary to ensure that all written characters are immediately written to the underlying stream. The close() method is used to close the writer and the underlying stream."}
