{"api": "InputStream.read", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: reading c# binary files in java: :I have a program in C# .net which writes 1 integer and 3 strings to a file, using BinaryWriter.Write(). Now I am programming in Java (for Android, and I'm new in Java), and I have to access the data which were previously written to a file using C#. I tried using DataInputStream.readInt() and DataInputStream.readUTF(), but I can't get proper results. I usually get a UTFDataFormatException: java.io.UTFDataFormatException: malformed input around byte 21or the String and int I get is wrong...FileInputStream fs = new FileInputStream(strFilePath);DataInputStream ds = new DataInputStream(fs);int i;String str1,str2,str3;i=ds.readInt();str1=ds.readUTF();str2=ds.readUTF();str3=ds.readUTF();ds.close();What is the proper way of doing this?   \nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.io.InputStream\n<<<code>>>: FileInputStream fs = new FileInputStream(strFilePath);\nDataInputStream ds = new DataInputStream(fs);\nint i;\nString str1, str2, str3;\ni = ds.readInt();\nstr1 = ds.readUTF();\nstr2 = ds.readUTF();\nstr3 = ds.readUTF();\nds.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: To read binary data from a file in Java, you can use the read() method of the InputStream class. This method reads a single byte of data from the input stream and returns it as an int. To read an integer, you can use the readInt() method of the DataInputStream class, which reads 4 bytes of data and returns it as an int. To read strings, you can use the readUTF() method of the DataInputStream class, which reads a variable number of bytes depending on the length of the string and returns it as a string. It's important to note that the read() method reads data in bytes, not characters, so you may need to convert the data to a string using the String.valueOf() method."}
