USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: what is the efficent way to process larges text files?: :I have two files:1- with 1400000 line or record --- 14 MB2- with 16000000 -- 170 MBI want to find if each record or line in file 1 is also in file 2 or notI develop a java app that do the following: Read file line by line and pass each line to a method that loop in file 2 Here is my code:  public boolean hasIDin(String bioid) throws Exception {    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"C://AllIDs.txt\"));    long bid = Long.parseLong(bioid);    String thisLine;    while((thisLine = br.readLine( )) != null)    {         if (Long.parseLong(thisLine) == bid)            return true;    }        return false;    }public void getMBD() throws Exception{     BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"C://DIDs.txt\"));     OutputStream os = new FileOutputStream(\"C://MBD.txt\");     PrintWriter pr = new PrintWriter(os);     String thisLine;     int count=1;     while ((thisLine = br.readLine( )) != null){         String bioid = thisLine;         System.out.println(count);         if(! hasIDin(bioid))                pr.println(bioid);     count++;     }    pr.close();}  When I run it seems it will take more 1944.44444444444 hours to complete as every line processing takes 5 sec. That is about three months!Is there any ideas to make it done in a much much more less time.Thanks in advance.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: String bioid = thisLine;\nPrintWriter pr = new PrintWriter(os);\npr.println(bioid);\n<<<explanation>>>: The write() method of the PrintWriter class writes a sequence of characters to the output stream. This method is used to write a string to the output stream. By using this method, you can avoid reading the entire file into memory and processing it line by line, which can be a time-consuming operation. Instead, you can write the lines of the file directly to the output stream, which can be much faster."}
