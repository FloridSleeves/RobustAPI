The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Read Specific Data with Buffered Filereader: :From a text file I am trying to get the the 3rd set of data (type = double) in a row and then sum it up to get the total. My problem is that I am having trouble figuring out how to grab a specific piece of data out of a line with a buffered file reader. I know how to get the line, but parsing the data is the mystery. I have placed my code below in case it may help give more context. Thanks!EDIT: Please bear with me. I'm literally within my first month of learning Java. I have to use buffered reader. This is a school project. Am I supposed to use \"split\"? If so can I store the \"next split\" or something into and array?listings.txtInt           string(?) double   intPropertyID    Type    Cost     AgentID --(Not in the file.
