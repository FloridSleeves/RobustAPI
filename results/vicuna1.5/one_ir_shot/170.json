USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Executing command in terminal from java programmatically: :I have a requirement to execute a command in terminal using java. I am really stuck up to access terminal window of mac through java code programmatically. It would be really useful if you provide your valuable solutions to perform my task which i have been struggling to do for a past two days. I am also posting the piece of code that I am trying to do for your reference. Any kind of help would be helpful for mepublic class TerminalScript{    public static void main(String args[]){        try {            Process proc = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(\"/Users/xxxx/Desktop/NewFolder/keytool -genkey -v -keystore test.keystore -alias test -keyalg RSA -sigalg SHA1withRSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000\");             BufferedReader read = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(                    proc.getInputStream()));            try {                proc.waitFor();            } catch (InterruptedException e) {                System.out.println(e.getMessage());            }            while (read.ready()) {                System.out.println(read.readLine());            }        } catch (IOException e) {            System.out.println(e.getMessage());        }    }}Note: I have to run the command keytool -genkey -v -keystore test.keystore -alias test -keyalg RSA -sigalg SHA1withRSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 in terminal through java program.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader read = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(proc.getInputStream()));\nwhile (read.ready()) {\nSystem.out.println(read.readLine());\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The readLine() method of the BufferedReader class reads a line of text from the input stream and returns it as a string. The ready() method of the BufferedReader class returns true if there is at least one character available to be read from the input stream. The getInputStream() method of the Process class returns an InputStream that can be used to read from the standard input stream of the process."}
