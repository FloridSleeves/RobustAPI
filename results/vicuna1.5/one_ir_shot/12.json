USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Function to change TextView doesn't work when called from another class: :I've written a function to change the text of a TextView. It's in the class of the activity which contains the TextView. However, this function doesn't work when it's called from another class.The function looks like this:public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {    public void changeTest() {        TextView test = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.textViewTest);        guessedLetters.setText(\"test\");    }}If I call this function from my MainActivity, it works perfectly fine:public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {    @Override    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);        setContentView(R.layout.activity_gameplay);        changeTest();    }}But if I call it from a class that extends MainActivity, I get a java.lang.NullPointerException at android.app.Activity.findViewById(Activity.java:1884).public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {    @Override    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);        setContentView(R.layout.activity_gameplay);        MyClass myClass = new MyClass();        myClass.myFunction();    }}public class MyClass extends MainActivity {    public void myFunction() {        MainActivity mainActivity = new MainActivity();        mainActivity.changeTest();    }}How could I fix this?\nPlease using this api: Activity.findViewById.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Activity.findViewById\n<<<code>>>: public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {\npublic void changeTest() {\nTextView test = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.textViewTest);\nguessedLetters.setText(\"test\");\n}\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The issue here is that you are trying to call the changeTest() function from a class that is not the activity. The findViewById() method can only be called from an activity or a fragment. To fix this, you can either call the changeTest() function from the activity where the TextView is located or you can pass the activity to the MyClass class as a parameter and call the changeTest() function from there."}
