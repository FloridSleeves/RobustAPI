This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Java Writing to a File Test Scores: :I have to make a program that asks the user to enter several scores. Each score needs to be written to the file \"scores.txt,\" but after I enter my 10 scores, the program doesn't do anything, and the scores are not being written to the file. Basically, I'm not sure how to use processFile to show the mean score. The final program should prompt the user for several scores, write the scores to a file, then open that file, calculate the mean, and display it. I have to use an exit condition, and if it is negative, it should assume the user is done entering data.    public class MoreTestScores {    /**     * @param args the command line arguments     */    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {        writeToFile(\"scores.txt\");        processFile(\"scores.txt\");    }    public static void writeToFile (String filename) throws IOException {        BufferedWriter outputWriter = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(\"scores.txt\"));        System.out.println(\"Please enter 10 scores.\");        System.out.println(\"You must hit enter after you enter each score.\");        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);        int score = 0;        while (score <= 10) {            int val = sc.nextInt();            if (val < 0) break;            outputWriter.write(val);            score++;        }        outputWriter.flush();        outputWriter.close();    }    public static void processFile (String filename) throws IOException, FileNotFoundException {        double sum = 0;        double number;        double average;        double count = 0;        BufferedReader inputReader = new BufferedReader (new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream(\"scores.txt\")));        String line;        while ((line = inputReader.readLine()) != null) {            number = Double.parseDouble(line);            sum += number;            count ++;        }        average = sum/count;        System.out.println(average);        inputReader.close();    }}\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: BufferedWriter outputWriter = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(\"scores.txt\"));\noutputWriter.write(\"Please enter 10 scores.\");\noutputWriter.newLine();\noutputWriter.write(\"You must hit enter after you enter each score.\");\noutputWriter.newLine();\nScanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);\nint score = 0;\nwhile (score <= 10) {\nint val = sc.nextInt();\nif (val < 0) break;\noutputWriter.write(val);\nscore++;\n}\noutputWriter.flush();\noutputWriter.close();\n\npublic static void processFile(String filename) throws IOException, FileNotFoundException {\ndouble sum = 0;\ndouble number;\ndouble average;\ndouble count = 0;\nBufferedReader inputReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream(filename)));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = inputReader.readLine()) != null) {\nline = line.trim();\nif (!line.isEmpty()) {\nnumber = Double.parseDouble(line);\nsum += number;\ncount++;\n}\n}\naverage = sum/count;\nSystem.out.println(average);\ninputReader.close();\n}\n}"}
