{"api": "PrintWriter.write", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: java jasper report export to stream blank page: :I use jasper reports version 6.2.1 with the following configuration:HttpServletResponse response = (HttpServletResponse) FacesContext.getCurrentInstance().getExternalContext().getResponse(); JREmptyDataSource jasper = new JREmptyDataSource(); JasperPrint jasperPrint = jasperFillManager.fillReport(this.getClass().getClassLoader().getResource(\"/reports/tn2.jasper\").getPath(), null, jasper);response.setContentType(\"application/pdf\");response.setHeader(\"Content-Disposition\", \"attachment\" + \"; filename=hehe.pdf\");ByteArrayOutputStream finalReport = new ByteArrayOutputStream();JasperExportManager.exportReportToPdfStream(jasperPrint,finalReport);PrintWriter ouputStream = response.getWriter();ouputStream.write(new String(finalReport.toByteArray()));ouputStream.flush();FacesContext.getCurrentInstance().responseComplete();I do it from my JSF 2.x backing bean.But I always get a blank page when try to export to stream. But if I do:JasperExportManager.exportReportToPdfFile(jasperPrint,                                \"d://hehe.pdf\");it works ok, I see the content in the generated file. How to force it work with streams? I tried to close/flush streams in different configurations, use ARM, etc. No luck so far\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter outputStream = response.getWriter();\noutputStream.write(\"<html><head><title>Page Title</title></head><body>\");\noutputStream.write(\"<p>This is a blank page.</p>\");\noutputStream.write(\"</body></html>\");\noutputStream.flush();\nFacesContext.getCurrentInstance().responseComplete();\n\nExplanation:\nIt seems that the issue is with the way the report is being exported to the stream. Instead of writing the content directly to the stream, you are creating a ByteArrayOutputStream and then writing it to the response's writer. This approach is not recommended and may cause issues. To fix the issue, you can try writing the content directly to the response's writer using the PrintWriter.write() method. This will ensure that the content is written to the stream correctly and will be visible in the exported PDF."}
