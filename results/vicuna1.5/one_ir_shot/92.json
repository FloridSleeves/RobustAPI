{"api": "DataOutputStream.write", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: TCP Server-Client large json: :I currently have a TCP server (java desktop application) and client (android application) connected.I can send json string from client to server and from server to client, my issue is sometimes i need to send from the server a large string which gets cut.This is my code:SERVER SIDE public void sendResponse(String response){  PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(BufferedWriter(                       new OutputStreamWriter(mClientSocket.getOutputStream())), true);  if(writer != null && !writer.checkError()){     writer.println(response);     writer.flush();  }}CLIENT SIDEBufferedReader input = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(mSocket.getInputStream()));String response;while((response = input.readLine()) != null && mRun){    Data data = new Gson().fromJson(response, Data.class);    //when i try to convert the response to Data object using Gson    //it gives me a com.google.gson.JsonSyntaxException: com.google.gson.stream.MalformedJsonException: Unterminated array at line 1 column 106498}as you can see the error on client side happens because the string was to large so it got cut off, can someone please tell me what to do in this case?thanks in advance.\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: DataOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>: DataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(mClientSocket.getOutputStream());\ndos.writeUTF(response);\ndos.flush();\n<<<explanation>>>: The writeUTF() method of the DataOutputStream class writes a UTF-8 encoded string to the stream. This method is used to write strings in a similar way to how they are written with the PrintWriter class. The flush() method is used to ensure that the data is written to the stream before the connection is closed."}
