USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Receiving Data On Sinatra Server: :I am able to send data to a sinatra server (Strings) but I'm not sure about how to actually receive it in the sinatra code. Could anyone help?Java client (what i'm using to send data) code:private static void contactServer() {    try {        String text = \"This is a text please work\";        Socket sock = new Socket(\"localhost\", 4567);        OutputStream os = sock.getOutputStream();        URL url = new URL(\"http://localhost:4567/hello\");        PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(os);        writer.flush();        writer.write(text);        url.openStream();        System.out.println(\"done\");        String strTemp = \"\";        /*while(null != (strTemp = br.readLine())){            System.out.println(strTemp);        }*/    } catch (Exception e) {        e.printStackTrace();    }}\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: String text = \"This is a text please work\";\nPrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(sock.getOutputStream());\nwriter.write(text);\n<<<explanation>>>: The write() method of the PrintWriter class writes a sequence of characters to the output stream. This method is used to write data to the server. The output stream is obtained using the getOutputStream() method of the Socket class. The data is written to the output stream using the write() method of the PrintWriter class."}
