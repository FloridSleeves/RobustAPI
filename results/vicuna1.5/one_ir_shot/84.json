{"api": "DataOutputStream.write", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to do I convert the PublicKey to OpenSSH authorized_keys format: :Here is the code to get the public key. I need to convert the public key to OpenSSH format to add it to the authorized_keys file in Linux. How can I do that?KeyPairGenerator kpGen = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(\"DSA\", \"BC\");kpGen.initialize(1024, new SecureRandom());KeyPair keypair = kpGen.generateKeyPair();I did use PEMWriter. But it didn't give the output string in proper format.\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: DataOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>: DataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(\"authorized_keys\"));\ndos.writeUTF(\"ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDvKR...\");\ndos.writeUTF(\"ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDvKR...\");\ndos.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The writeUTF() method of the DataOutputStream class writes a string in the format \"type=value\" to the output stream. In this case, we are writing the public key in OpenSSH format with type \"ssh-rsa\" and value being the base64 encoded public key. The FileOutputStream is used to write the data to the \"authorized\\_keys\" file in the correct format."}
