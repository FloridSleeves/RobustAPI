{"api": "PrintWriter.write", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Java : Writing CSV in String format to CSV in a file: :A method returns a String in comma separated format. For example, the returned String can be like the one given below.Tarantino,50,M,USA\\n Carey Mulligan,27,F,UK\\n Gong Li,45,F,ChinaI will need to get this String and write it into a CSV file. I'll have to insert a header and a footer for this file as well.For example, when I open the file, the contents for the above data will be Name,Age,Gender,CountryTarantino,50,M,USA    Carey Mulligan,27,F,UKGong Li,45,F,ChinaHow do we do that ? Are there any open source libraries to do this task ? \nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: String csvString = \"Name,Age,Gender,Country\\n\" +\n        \"Tarantino,50,M,USA\\n\" +\n        \"Carey Mulligan,27,F,UK\\n\" +\n        \"Gong Li,45,F,China\";\nPrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"output.csv\");\nwriter.write(csvString);\nwriter.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The PrintWriter class is used to write text to a file. The write() method is used to write the given string to the file. The first argument is the file to which the text is to be written, and the second argument is the text to be written. In this case, the csvString is the string that contains the data in the format of comma separated values and the file name is \"output.csv\". The close() method is used to close the writer after writing to the file."}
