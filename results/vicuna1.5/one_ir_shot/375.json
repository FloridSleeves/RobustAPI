{"api": "Iterator.next", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Get an Enumeration (for the Keys) of a Map (HashMap) in Java?: :As far as I understand this, it seems that there is not a direct way of getting an Enumeration directly for the Keys of a HashMap. I can only get a keySet(). From that Set, I can get an Iterator but an Iterator seems to be something different than an Enumeration. What is the best and most performant way to directly get an Enumeration from the Keys of a HashMap?Background: I am implementing my own ResourceBundle (=>getKeys() Method), and I have to provide/implement a method that returns the Enumeration of all Keys. But my implementation is based on a HashMap so I need to somehow figure out how to best convert betweens these two \"Iterator/Enumerator\" techniques.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: Map<String, String> map = new HashMap<>();\nmap.put(\"key1\", \"value1\");\nmap.put(\"key2\", \"value2\");\nIterator<String> iterator = map.keySet().iterator();\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\nString key = iterator.next();\nSystem.out.println(key);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The keySet() method of the Map interface returns a Set view of the keys of this map. The iterator() method returns an Iterator view of the keys. The hasNext() method of the Iterator interface returns true if this iterator has at least one more element. The next() method of the Iterator interface returns the next element in this iterator. So, we can use a while loop to iterate over the keys and get the Enumeration of all Keys."}
