{"api": "RandomAccessFile.read", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Read a segment of a file in Java / Android: :I'm sure this might be a simple question, but unfortunately this is my first time using Java and working the Android SDK.I am uploading files on Android using the Apache HTTP libraries, in particular using the MultipartEntity.I'm uploading to a service that allows me to send them chunks of the file, and once complete, they'll reassemble the chunks.  I'd like to take advantage of this feature.Here's the scenario.File FOO.BAR is 20 MB.  I'd split it into some arbitrary chunk size, let's say 1 MB, which means 20 chunks.   Chunks #3 and #14 fail (maybe the cellular/WiFi connection was bad).  I can now re-upload just these two chunks and everything will be good.What I'd like to know is how can I read only part of a file (like the data between 3MB and 4MB)?  The file piece should be an InputStream or File object.Thanks,Makoto\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: RandomAccessFile.read\n<<<code>>>: RandomAccessFile file = new RandomAccessFile(\"FOO.BAR\", \"r\");\nlong position = 3 * 1024 * 1024; // 3MB\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\nint bytesRead = file.read(buffer, position, buffer.length - position);\nfile.close();\nbyte[] chunk = new byte[bytesRead];\nSystem.arraycopy(buffer, 0, chunk, 0, bytesRead);\nInputStream inputStream = new ByteArrayInputStream(chunk);\nFile newFile = new File(\"FOO.BAR.part3\");\nFileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(newFile);\nfos.write(inputStream);\nfos.close();\n```\nThis code reads the file \"FOO.BAR\" and creates a new file \"FOO.BAR.part3\" containing the data between the 3rd and 4th MB of the original file.\n```"}
