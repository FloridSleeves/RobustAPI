{"api": "RandomAccessFile.read", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Gets the uncompressed size of this GZIPInputStream?: :I have a GZIPInputStream that I constructed from another ByteArrayInputStream. I want to know the original (uncompressed) length for the gzip data. Although I can read to the end of the GZIPInputStream, then count the number, it will cost much time and waste CPU. I would like to know the size before read it.Is there a similiar method like ZipEntry.getSize() for GZIPInputStream:public long getSize ()Since: API Level 1  Gets the uncompressed size of this ZipEntry.\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: RandomAccessFile.read\n<<<code>>>: long size = new RandomAccessFile(\"path/to/gzip/file\", \"r\").length();\n<<<explanation>>>: The length() method of the RandomAccessFile class returns the length of the file in bytes. This can be used to get the uncompressed size of a GZIPInputStream by opening the corresponding file and reading its length."}
