{"api": "PrintWriter.write", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to add a UTF-8 BOM in Java?: :I have a Java stored procedure which fetches record from the table using Resultset object and creates a CS Vfile.BLOB retBLOB = BLOB.createTemporary(conn, true, BLOB.DURATION_SESSION);retBLOB.open(BLOB.MODE_READWRITE);OutputStream bOut = retBLOB.setBinaryStream(0L);ZipOutputStream zipOut = new ZipOutputStream(bOut);PrintStream out = new PrintStream(zipOut,false,\"UTF-8\");out.write('\\ufeff');out.flush();zipOut.putNextEntry(new ZipEntry(\"filename.csv\"));while (rs.next()){    out.print(\"\\\"\" + rs.getString(i) + \"\\\"\");    out.print(\",\");}out.flush();zipOut.closeEntry();zipOut.close();retBLOB.close();return retBLOB;But the generated CSV file doesn't show the correct German character. Oracle database also has a NLS_CHARACTERSET value of UTF8.Please suggest.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(zipOut, false, \"UTF-8\");\nout.write('\\ufeff');\nout.write(rs.getString(i));\nout.write(\",\");\nout.flush();\n<<<explanation>>>: The PrintWriter.write() method allows you to write characters to a stream. In this case, we are writing the UTF-8 BOM followed by the string retrieved from the ResultSet. The third parameter of the PrintWriter constructor is the character encoding, which is set to \"UTF-8\". This ensures that the characters are written in the correct encoding and can be correctly displayed in the generated CSV file."}
