The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Separate one String with ',' character into two new String: :A MySQL table called item_list has a field named description, the problem is the previous programmer combined the name and description of the item in one field called description. The data is now at 20k+. Now I am going to have a problem during migration.So how do I separate oneString description=\"BEARING, ROLLER 23230CKE4 SPHERICAL\"  into two new stringsString name=\"BEARING\" String description=\"ROLLER 23230CKE4 SPHERICAL\"Any help will be appreciated.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String description = \"BEARING, ROLLER 23230CKE4 SPHERICAL\";\nString[] tokens = description.split(\",\\\\s*\");\nString name = tokens[0];\nString description = tokens[1];\n<<<explanation>>>: The StringTokenizer class can be used to split a string into an array of tokens based on a specified delimiter. In this case, the delimiter is a comma followed by zero or more whitespace characters. The nextToken() method of the StringTokenizer class can be used to retrieve the next token in the array. The split() method of the String class can be used to split the string into an array of tokens based on a specified delimiter. The first token in the array will be assigned to the name variable, and the remaining tokens will be assigned to the description variable."}
