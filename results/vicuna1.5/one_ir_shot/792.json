This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Can I copy thread.dumpstack() output to file: :I am using jdk1.4 so I have to use thread.dumpstack() method to print call stack and I want all the dump into file,Is there any way to do it?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"stack.txt\");\nThread.dumpStack(writer, 1000);\n<<<explanation>>>: The PrintWriter.write() method can be used to write the output of the thread.dumpStack() method to a file.
