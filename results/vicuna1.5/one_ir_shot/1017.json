The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to split a string value using the pipe symbol as separator?: :I need to split a string using the pipe symbol '|'In this scenario I can split the string value but if I have  a \"bullet number\" greater than (0-9), it prints only the first digit of the number.Example: If input is 11. Welcome to java programming It will print 1 Welcome to java programming This is my code so farpublic static void main(String[] args) {    String split_vls = \"11. Welcome1. to java programming |1. Oops concepts |12. Encapsulation |3.Abstraction  |14.Inheritance  |5.Polymorphism\";    String[] Numeric_split = split_vls.split(\"\\\\|*(\\\\d+\\\\.)\\\\s*\");    for (String pipes_Split : Numeric_split) {        System.out.println(pipes_Split);    }}This is the output that I get:to java programming   Oops concepts   Encapsulation   Abstraction  Inheritance  PolymorphicThis is the expected output: Welcome to java programming  Oops concepts  Encapsulation  Abstraction  Inheritance  Polymorphic\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String split_vls = \"11.

The nextToken() method of the StringTokenizer class is used to retrieve the next token from the input string. This method returns the next token in the sequence of tokens, or null if the end of the input has been reached. In this case, we can use the nextToken() method to split the string based on the pipe symbol '|' and then retrieve the numeric portion of the token using the regular expression \\d+\\\\."}
