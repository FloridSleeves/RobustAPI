{"api": "Iterator.next", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to get the size or length of column in generated Excel file using POI Apache: :I think my title is clear what I want to know. I already searched google and there's no answer to my problem. I want to know how can I get the size or length of an specific column in POI Apache Java?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: POI Apache\n<<<code>>>: Iterator iterator = workbook.getSheetAt(0).getRowIterator();\nint columnIndex = 0;\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\nint cellValue = (Integer) iterator.next().getCellValue();\ncolumnIndex++;\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The getRowIterator() method returns an Iterator for the rows in the sheet. The hasNext() method checks if there are more rows to iterate through. The next() method returns the value of the next cell in the row. To get the size of a specific column, you need to iterate through all the rows in the sheet and increment a counter for each cell in the desired column."}
