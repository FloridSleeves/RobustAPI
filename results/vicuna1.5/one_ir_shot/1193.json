{"api": "StringTokenizer.nextToken", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: java program to return the sum of all integers found in the parameter String: :i want write a java program to return the sum of all integers found in the parameter String.for example take a string like:\" 12 hi when 8 and 9\"now the answer is 12+8+9=29.but i really dont know even how to start can any one help in this!\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String inputString = \"12 hi when 8 and 9\";\nint sum = 0;\nfor (String token : StringTokenizer.nextToken(inputString, \" \")) {\nif (token.matches(\"\\\\d+\")) {\nsum += Integer.parseInt(token);\n}\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The StringTokenizer class is used to split a string into a sequence of tokens. The nextToken() method returns the next token in the sequence. The matches() method is used to check if the current token matches a given regular expression. The Integer.parseInt() method is used to convert the token to an integer. The sum is calculated by iterating through the tokens and adding up the integers."}
