The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: return double value of string passed: :Create a method called parseEqn which will receive 1 String variable and return the double value of the expression passed to it. parseEqn(\"123+23\") \u2192 146.0parseEqn(\"3+5\") \u2192 8.0parseEqn(\"3-5\") \u2192 -2.0this is what i have so far:public double parseEqn(String str) {   StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(str,\"+-/*%\",true);   String first = st.nextToken();   String op = st.nextToken();   String second = st.nextToken();   double ff = Double.parseDouble(first);   double ss = Double.parseDouble(second);   double answer;   if (op.equals(\"+\")){   answer= ff+ss;}   else if (op.equals(\"-\")){   answer= ff-ss;}   else if (op.equals(\"/\")){   answer= ff/ss;}   else (op.equals(\"*\")){   answer= ff*ss;}   return answer;I keep getting the error Syntax error, insert \"AssignmentOperator ArrayInitializer\" to complete ArrayInitializerAssignement....what does that mean?what do i need to do to my loop in order for it to work? i can manually input say ff+ss and the method will work just fine, but i cant seem to create a loop to check which operator is in the string for me and then pass the answer back. note: im on a time crunch and would really appreciate help. a straight forward answer/explanation would be so helpful... not those super vague \"oh its not hard...\" type of thing... \nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: public double parseEqn(String str) {\nStringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(str,\"+-/*%\",true);\nString first = st.nextToken();\nString op = st.nextToken();\nString second = st.nextToken();\ndouble ff = Double.parseDouble(first);\ndouble ss = Double.parseDouble(second);\ndouble answer;\nif (op.equals(\"+\")){\nanswer= ff+ss;}\nelse if (op.equals(\"-\")){\nanswer= ff-ss;}\nelse if (op.equals(\"/\")){\nanswer= ff/ss;}\nelse (op.equals(\"*\")){\nanswer= ff*ss;}\nreturn answer;\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The nextToken() method of the StringTokenizer class returns the next token in the string.
