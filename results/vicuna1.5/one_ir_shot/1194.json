And I have to convert String to Double. For example if I have a string:Double dob1,dob2;String str = \"12345,56789\";Now I have to convert this into double format and want the values to be stored like:dob1 = 12345dob2 = 56789How can I do this?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String str = \"12345,56789\";\ndouble dob1 = Double.parseDouble(StringTokenizer.nextToken(str));\ndouble dob2 = Double.parseDouble(StringTokenizer.nextToken(str));\n<<<explanation>>>: The StringTokenizer class is used to split a string into a sequence of tokens. The nextToken() method returns the next token in the string. The parseDouble() method is used to convert a string to a double."}
