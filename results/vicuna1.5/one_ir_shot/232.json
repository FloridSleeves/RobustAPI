{"api": "InputStream.read", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Files don't transfer completely: :I'm trying to send a file from client to the server, but only ~8kb of lager files(~100kb) transferred. And pngs for example are not completely viewable.I really don't know why it stops earlier.Sending small testfiles(~1 kb) works great.The server part:                    ServerSocket fileSocket = new ServerSocket(p);                    boolean rdy = false;                    while (!rdy) {                        Socket client = fileSocket.accept();                        String fileName = \"C:/\" + args[2];                        String cmd = fileName + \"\\n\";                        OutputStreamWriter sWriter = new OutputStreamWriter(client.getOutputStream());                        sWriter.write(cmd, 0, cmd.length());                        sWriter.flush();                        InputStream inStream = client.getInputStream();                        FileOutputStream fileStream = new FileOutputStream(fileName);                        byte[] buffer = new byte[client.getReceiveBufferSize()];                        int bytesRead = 0;                        while ((bytesRead = inStream.read(buffer)) > 0) {                            fileStream.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);                        }                        fileStream.flush();                        ta.append(\"File transfered\");                        inStream.close();                        fileStream.close();                        rdy = true;                    }                    fileSocket.close();                    return;The client part:Socket client = new Socket(ip, port);        OutputStream outStream = client.getOutputStream();        FileInputStream fileStream = new FileInputStream(fileName);        byte[] buffer = new byte[(int) fileStream.getChannel().size()];        int bytesRead = 0;        System.out.println(\"Sending file: \" + fileName);        while ((bytesRead = fileStream.read(buffer)) > 0) {            outStream.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);        }        outStream.close();        fileStream.close();        client.close();        return;\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: int bytesRead = fileStream.read(buffer);\n<<<explanation>>>: The read() method of the InputStream class reads a single byte of data from the input stream and returns an integer value representing the number of bytes read. This method blocks until a byte is available or the end of the stream is reached. It is used to read data from the input stream one byte at a time."}
