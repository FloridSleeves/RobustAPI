This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I copy a wav file from one directory to another in java?: :In my program, I have used an adaptation of an example in the documentation for the JSch package that describes how to copy files from a remote server to the local machine.  Though the program appears to work, the files seem to be corrupted in the copying process, and when I try to play them from bash, I get an error that reads \"play FAIL formats: can't open input file `79_97_729.wav': WAVE: RIFF header not found\".My copy method is as follows:public void copyFile(File file, String newName) throws JSchException, IOException{    String prefix = null;    if (new File(destination).isDirectory()){        prefix = destination + File.separator;    }    JSch jsch = new JSch();    Session session = jsch.getSession(\"username\", \"network\");    session.setUserInfo(new MyUserInfo());    session.connect();    String command = \"scp -f \" + file.getAbsolutePath();    Channel channel = session.openChannel(\"exec\");    ((ChannelExec)channel).setCommand(command);    OutputStream out = channel.getOutputStream();    InputStream in = channel.getInputStream();    channel.connect();    byte[] buf = new byte[1024];    // send '\\0'    buf[0]=0; out.write(buf, 0, 1); out.flush();    while(true){        int c=checkAck(in);        if(c!='C'){            break;        }        // read '0644 '        in.read(buf, 0, 5);        long filesize=0L;        while(true){            if(in.read(buf, 0, 1)<0){                // error                break;            }            if(buf[0]==' ')break;            filesize=filesize*10L+(long)(buf[0]-'0');        }        // send '\\0'        buf[0]=0; out.write(buf, 0, 1); out.flush();        // read a content of lfile        fos=new FileOutputStream(prefix == null ? destination : prefix + newName);        int foo;        while(true){            if(buf.length<filesize) foo=buf.length;            else foo=(int)filesize;            foo=in.read(buf, 0, foo);            if(foo<0){                // error                break;            }            fos.write(buf, 0, foo);            filesize-=foo;            if(filesize==0L) break;        }        fos.close();        fos=null;        // send '\\0'        buf[0]=0; out.write(buf, 0, 1); out.flush();    }    session.disconnect();}Is there some sort of adaptation I can do to control for the fact that the files I am copying are in wav format?  Any help would be appreciated!\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: int filesize = 0;\nwhile (true) {\nif (in.read(buf, 0, 1) < 0) {\n// error\nbreak;\n}\nif (buf[0] == ' ') {\nbreak;\n}\nfilesize = filesize \\* 10 + (long)(buf[0] - '0');\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The read() method of the InputStream class reads a single byte of data from the input stream. This method blocks until a byte of data is available, or an exception is thrown. In this code, the read() method is used to read the size of the file in bytes. The file size is stored in the filesize variable. The code reads the size of the file in bytes and stores it in the filesize variable. The filesize variable is used to keep track of the current size of the file. The code reads the size of the file in bytes and stores it in the filesize variable.
