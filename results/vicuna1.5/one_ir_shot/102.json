{"api": "DataOutputStream.write", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Java, Sending data to different IPs: :I am making a simple chat client for fun, I have the Server/Client working and sending data perfectly. I would like to know how I can send data to selected users. The selecting part I can work out, but I don't know how to send things to the selected IPs. Here is my server so far.package Server;import java.io.DataInputStream;import java.io.DataOutputStream;import java.io.IOException;import java.net.ServerSocket;import java.net.Socket;/** * @class Connect * @date Feb 25, 2013 10:14:00 PM * @author Zach */public class Connect { //Server    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {        ServerSocket server = new ServerSocket(43595);        while (server.isBound()) {            Socket s = server.accept();            DataOutputStream out = new DataOutputStream(s.getOutputStream());            DataInputStream in = new DataInputStream(s.getInputStream());            int length = in.read();            byte[] data = new byte[length];            in.read(data);            String str = new String(data, \"UTF-8\");            s.close();        }    }}I want to redirect information off of the server to a specific client\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: DataOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>: DataOutputStream out = new DataOutputStream(s.getOutputStream());\nout.writeUTF(\"message to send\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The writeUTF() method of the DataOutputStream class writes a UTF-8 encoded string to the stream. This method is used to write a string that contains Unicode characters."}
