{"api": "StringTokenizer.nextToken", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: extract string including whitespaces within string (java): :I have a string that contains 2 integer numbers separated by whitespace followed by any character string which includes whitespace.Example:23 14 this is a random stringHow do I extract this is a random string?The integers aren't guaranteed to be double digits therefore I can't figure out how to use indexOf and substring to extract this data.Thanks in advance.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String str = \"23 14 this is a random string\";\nString[] tokens = str.split(\" \");\nString result = tokens[1];\n<<<explanation>>>: The StringTokenizer class is used to split a string into a sequence of tokens. The nextToken() method returns the next token in the sequence, or null if the end of the sequence is reached. In this case, we are using the split() method with a space as the delimiter to split the string into an array of tokens, and then accessing the second element of the array to get the desired result."}
