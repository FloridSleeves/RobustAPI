This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: TextVisibility change after a period of time: :, I have just started learning java for android, I have set the TextVisibility of a textfield to GONE, I need the TextVisibilty to change to VISIBLE after 7 seconds from Button click, I had searched the internet and could not find anything useful or I could'nt understand. So, Please help me.\nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Activity.setContentView\n<<<code>>>: Button button = findViewById(R.id.button);\nTextView textView = findViewById(R.id.textView);\nbutton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {\n@Override\npublic void onClick(View v) {\ntextView.setVisibility(View.GONE);\nnew Handler().postDelayed(new Runnable() {\n@Override\npublic void run() {\ntextView.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);\n}\n}, 7000);\n}\n});\n<<<explanation>>>: To change the visibility of a view after a period of time, you can use the Handler class along with the postDelayed() method. The postDelayed() method takes a Runnable object as an argument, which is executed after the specified delay. In this case, the visibility of the textView is changed to VISIBLE after 7 seconds by calling the setVisibility() method. The setOnClickListener() method is used to set a click listener on the button, which sets the visibility of the textView to GONE when the button is clicked."}
