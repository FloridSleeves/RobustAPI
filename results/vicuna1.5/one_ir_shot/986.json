USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: This code is showing errors.What is wrong with this code?: :This question already has answers here:                                                            Why do I get the \"Unhandled exception type IOException\"?

In this code, the getBytes() method is used to convert the String \"Cricket\" into a byte array. Then, the FileOutputStream is used to write the byte array to a file. However, this code will throw a FileNotFoundException and IOException because the file does not exist in the specified location."}
