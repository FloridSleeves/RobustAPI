USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Get data from a Collection of maps with 2 int as parameters: :I have a variable like:  Collection<Map<String, String>> allFieldValues;In this variable I have all the data of a sqlite Table, each map of the collection represents a row of the table.Now I have to take the data of a specific cell, my parameters are 2 ints (row number, column number), so I am trying something like this:Iterator<Map<String, String>> iter = allFieldValues.iterator();for (int i = 0; i == givenRowAsParameter; i++){    iter.next();}And thats it, the iter that I get out of the loop its supossed to be the row that I want, but I can't take another Iterator from that Iterator to search for the column, neither I can't get a specific object of the iterator with just an int as a parameter. So Im stuck :(Any suggestions? thanks a lot!\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: Collection<Map<String, String>> allFieldValues = ...;\nIterator<Map<String, String>> iter = allFieldValues.iterator();\nwhile (iter.hasNext()) {\nint row = 0;\nint col = 0;\nMap<String, String> map = iter.next();\nif (map.containsKey(\"row\")) {\nrow = Integer.parseInt(map.get(\"row\"));\n}\nif (map.containsKey(\"col\")) {\ncol = Integer.parseInt(map.get(\"col\"));\n}\nif (row == givenRowAsParameter && col == givenColumnAsParameter) {\n// Do something with the map\n}\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The next() method of the Iterator interface returns the next element in the iteration order of the iterator. In this case, we are using an Iterator to iterate through a Collection of maps, and we want to check if the current map matches the row and column parameters we were given. If it does, we can perform some action with the map. We use the containsKey() and get() methods of the Map interface to check if the map contains the \"row\" and \"col\" keys, and then parse the values to integers. Finally, we can use the if statement to check if the current map matches the row and column parameters we were given, and if it does, we can perform some action with the map."}
