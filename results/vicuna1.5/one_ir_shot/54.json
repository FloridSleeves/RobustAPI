Can anyone please help me how to do it? thank you.\nAnswer:\n<<<explanation>>>: To sort the scores present in each line, you can use the `Collections.sort()` method and a lambda expression to compare the scores. To output the name with its corresponding score, you can use a `Scanner` to read the lines of the text file and then extract the name and score from each line. Here is an example of how you can do this:\n```\nScanner scanner = new Scanner(new File(\"sdcard/logger.file\"));\nwhile (scanner.hasNextLine()) {\n    String line = scanner.nextLine();\n    String[] parts = line.split(\" \");\n    int score = Integer.parseInt(parts[1]);\n    String name = parts[0];\n    System.out.println(name + \" \" + score);\n}\nscanner.close();\n```\nThis code reads the lines of the text file, splits each line into its name and score, and then parses the score as an integer. It then outputs the name and score in the format \"name score\"."}
