I have tried passing different data types to the function, a simple File, and an InputStream, but both returned null also. The documentation says that if no suitable ImageInputStreamSpi is found then the function will return null, but the file is a bog-standard JPEG, and surely Java comes with a service provider for such a format out of the box?Thanks for your time./** * Reads in an image from a file and returns the image in a * {@code BufferedImage} object. * * @param source the file to create the {@code BufferedImage} * from. * @return the {@code BufferedImage} object representing the image * in {@code source}. */private BufferedImage readImage( File source ) {    // There is only one image in this file    final int imageIndex = 0;    BufferedImage image = null;    try {        // Get the ImageReader object for this filetype        Iterator readers =            ImageIO.getImageReaders( source );        ImageReader reader = (ImageReader) readers.next();        // Create an ImageInputStream object from the source image file        ImageInputStream iis = ImageIO.createImageInputStream( source );        // Raises IllegalArgumentException, because iis is null        reader.setInput( iis, true );        // Read the image file        image = reader.read( imageIndex );    } catch ( Exception exception ) {        exception.printStackTrace();        System.exit( -1 );    }    return image;}\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "The `Iterator.next()` method returns the next element in the iterator. In this case, the iterator is obtained using `ImageIO.getImageReaders(source)`, which returns an iterator over the ImageReaders that can read the file `source`. The `next()` method is then called on the iterator to retrieve the first ImageReader in the list. This ImageReader is then used to create an `ImageInputStream` object using `ImageIO.createImageInputStream(source)`. However, if no suitable `ImageInputStreamSpi` can be found, `null` is returned. It's possible that the file `source` is not a supported file type or that there is a problem with the ImageIO library."}
