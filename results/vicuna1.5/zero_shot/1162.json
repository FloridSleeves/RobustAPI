USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: StringTokennizer, take only the last 3 elements out of 4: :I need some help to figure this problem i have run into. Have read a txt file with a buffer reader and trying to use a StringTokenizer.The string i have it like this, where some text first and some numbers after. I only need to numbers, and want to skip \"Text\".Test 2 5 1My code:// Check if the graph contains an cycle    StringTokenizer st1 = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());    Graph.checkForCycle(null, Integer.parseInt(st1.()), Integer.parseInt(st1.nextToken()), Integer.parseInt(st1.nextToken()));      As you can see there are 4 sets here and i want the last 3 to be send with the paramenter when i call the method Graph.checkForCycle()Hope someone can help.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken()\n<<<code>>>: StringTokenizer st1 = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\nst1.nextToken();\nst1.nextToken();\nst1.nextToken();\nGraph.checkForCycle(null, Integer.parseInt(st1.nextToken()), Integer.parseInt(st1.nextToken()), Integer.parseInt(st1.nextToken()));\n<<<explanation>>>: This code uses the StringTokenizer.nextToken() method to skip the first three elements of the input string and only take the last three elements. The first line creates a new StringTokenizer object and reads a line from the buffered reader. The next three lines call the nextToken() method three times to skip the first three elements of the input string. Finally, the last line calls the Graph.checkForCycle() method with the last three elements of the input string."}
