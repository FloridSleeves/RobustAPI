USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to convert UTF-8 to GBK string in java: :I retrieved HTML string from an objective site and within it there is a sectionclass=\"f9t\" name=\"\u00d3\u00c3\u00bb\u00a7\u00c3\u00fb:\u00f4\u00e2\u00c8\u00bb12\" I know it's in GBK encoding, as I can see it from the FF browser display. But I do not know how to convert that name string into a readable GBK string (such as \u4e0a\u6d77 or \u5317\u4eac).I am usingString sname = new String(name.getBytes(), \"UTF-8\");byte[] gbkbytes = sname.getBytes(\"gb2312\");String gbkStr = new String( gbkbytes );System.out.println(gbkStr);but it's not printed right in GBK text???\u00a1\u00ec??:????12I have no clue how to proceed.\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "The issue with your code is that you are using the \"gb2312\" encoding instead of \"GBK\" encoding. To convert the UTF-8 encoded string to a GBK encoded string, you can use the following code:\n\n<<<api>>>: java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets\n<<<code>>>: StandardCharsets.UTF_8.encode(\"\u00d4\u00c3\u00bb\u00a7\u00c3\u00fb:\u00f4\u00e2\u00c8\u00bb12\", StandardCharsets.GBK)\n<<<explanation>>>: The above code uses the UTF-8 encoding to convert the string \"\u00d4\u00c3\u00bb\u00a7\u00c3\u00fb:\u00f4\u00e2\u00c8\u00bb12\" to a byte array, and then uses the GBK encoding to convert the byte array to a string. The resulting string should be in GBK encoding."}
