USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Limit the size of a member collection in Hibernate: :I have a problem because I don't know if it is possible to limit the size of the activities list.I wish to only retrieve  most recent 5 activities. Is it possible to automatically do it during any fetch from DB? (so that I don't have to limit the collection by hand in Java).@Entitypublic class Person {    @Id    @GeneratedValue    private Long id;    @OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL, fetch = FetchType.EAGER)    @OrderBy(\"timestamp DESC\")    @JoinColumn(name = \"PERSON_ID\")    private List<Activity> activities;    // other setters, getters, etc. }Essentially I'd like to keep, say, 20 entries in the ACTIVITY entries (dropping the oldest rows, when newer are inserted), but fetch only 5 latest. Is this possible?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: org.hibernate.Query\n<<<code>>>: SELECT a FROM Person p JOIN p.activities a ORDER BY a.timestamp DESC LIMIT 5\n<<<explanation>>>: This Hibernate query selects the latest 5 activities from the \"activities\" list of each \"Person\" entity, ordered by the \"timestamp\" field in descending order. The \"LIMIT\" clause specifies that only 5 results should be returned. You can use this query as an iterator to fetch the desired results one by one."}
