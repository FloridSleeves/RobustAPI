USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Exception handling in Iterable: :Is there any way of handling -- and continuing from -- an exception in an iterator while maintaining the foreach syntactic sugar?I've got a parser that iterates over lines in a file, handing back a class-per-line.  Occasionally lines will be syntactically bogus, but that doesn't necessarily mean that we shouldn't keep reading the file.My parser implements Iterable, but dealing with the potential exceptions means writingfor (Iterator iter = myParser.iterator(); iter.hasNext(); ) {  try {    MyClass myClass = iter.next();    // .. do stuff ..  } catch (Exception e) {    // .. do exception stuff ..  }}.. nothing wrong with that, but is there any way of getting exception handling on the implicit individual iter.next() calls in the foreach construct?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: for (Iterator iter = myParser.iterator(); iter.hasNext(); ) {  try {    MyClass myClass = iter.next();    // .. do stuff ..  } catch (Exception e) {    // .. do exception stuff ..  }}\n<<<explanation>>>: The code you provided is already handling exceptions correctly by catching the exception in the catch block and handling it accordingly. However, there is no direct way to handle exceptions in the `Iterator.next()` method while maintaining the foreach syntactic sugar. The `Iterator.next()` method does not throw an exception, so you cannot catch it in the usual way. One way to handle exceptions in the `Iterator.next()` method is to override the `next()` method in your Iterator class and catch the exception there. However, this would require you to check for the exception in the `next()` method and handle it accordingly, which may not be as clean as the current implementation."}
