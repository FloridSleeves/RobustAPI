{"api": "Map.get", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Appending data to a subarray instead of having it overwritten with the latest entry: :I currently have a Map that is configured as such.Map<String, ArrayList<Object>> map = new HashMap<String, ArrayList<Object>>();where the purpose is to be able to have a setup much like the following:array(\"foo\"->array(1->\"aaa\",2->\"bbb\",3->\"ccc\"),      \"bar\"->array(1->\"aaa\",2->\"bbb\",3->\"ccc\"),      \"bah\"->array(1->\"aaa\",2->\"bbb\",3->\"ccc\"),)The problem I'm running into is that I can create the root array fine, but it will do the following, using the previous example as illustrationarray(\"foo\"->array(3->\"ccc\"),      \"bar\"->array(2->\"bbb\"),      \"bah\"->array(3->\"ccc\"),)What I'm trying to find out is how I can append the sub array as opposed to having it overwritten. I assume it's easily done I'm just missing something obvious.\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Map.get\n<<<code>>>: map.get(\"foo\")\n<<<explanation>>>: This code retrieves the value associated with the key \"foo\" in the Map. If the key exists, it returns the corresponding value. In this case, it returns the ArrayList that is associated with the key \"foo\". You can then use this ArrayList to append new elements to it, instead of overwriting it with the latest entry."}
