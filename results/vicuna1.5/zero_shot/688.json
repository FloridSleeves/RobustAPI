It consists of trying to write in the file for the last time. There are two threads: A - which is creating a file and checking if the right line is in the file and B - which is searching for a file and trying to rewrite the file with a \u201cgood\u201d line. The \u201cwinner\u201d thread must have string in a file. To do it thread checks if file has their line, file has only one line. The threads have only file path.public class A implements Runnable {private File file;private Thread t;public A(String patch,String fileName){    t = new Thread(this);    CreateFile(patch, fileName);    //t.setDaemon(true);    t.start();}@Overridepublic void run() {    BufferedReader reader;    while (!Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) {        try {            reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream(file)));            if (reader.readLine().charAt(0) == 'B') {                System.out.println(\"A try took file: \" + file.getName());                write();            } else {                System.out.println(\"A took file: \" + file.getName());            }        } catch (FileNotFoundException e)        {            System.out.println(\"File read A\" + e.toString());        }        catch (IOException e)        {            System.out.println(\"File read A\"+e.toString());        }    }}private void write() {    try {        PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(file);        printWriter.println(\"A took file: \" + file.getName());        System.out.println(\"A took file: \" + file.getName());        printWriter.close();    } catch (Exception e) {        System.out.println(\"File write A\");    }}public File CreateFile(String patch,String fileName) {    File file = new File(patch,fileName+\".txt\");    try {        PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(file);        printWriter.println(\"A took file: \" + file.getName());        System.out.println(\"A took file: \" + file.getName());        printWriter.close();    } catch (Exception e) {        System.out.println(\"File create A\");    }    return file;}}public class B implements Runnable {private File file;private Thread t;public B(String patch,String fileName){    t = new Thread(this);    //t.setDaemon(true);    FindFile(patch, fileName);    t.start();}@Overridepublic void run() {    BufferedReader reader;    while (!Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) {        try {            reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream(file)));            if (reader.readLine().charAt(0) == 'A') {                System.out.println(\"B try took file: \" + file.getName());                write();            } else {                System.out.println(\"B took file: \" + file.getName());            }        } catch (FileNotFoundException e)        {            System.out.println(\"File read B\" + e.toString());        }        catch (IOException e)        {            System.out.println(\"File read B\"+e.toString());        }    }}private void write() {    try {        PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(file);        printWriter.println(\"B took file: \" + file.getName());        System.out.println(\"B took file: \" + file.getName());        printWriter.close();    } catch (Exception e) {        System.out.println(\"File write B\");    }}public File FindFile(String patch,String fileName) {    File file= null;    File folder = new File(patch);    File[] listOfFiles = folder.listFiles();    BufferedReader reader;    for (int i = 0; i < listOfFiles.length; i++) {        file = listOfFiles[i];        if (file.getName().equals(fileName + \".txt\")) {            break;        }    }    return file;}}I want to synchronize in some way access to the file in threads. In my code I have java.lang.NullPointerException when I use readLine(), so I think this is because threads don\u2019t have synchronized access to the file (after every finished operation file must have one line). I can\u2019t use synchronized method or block, because threads don\u2019t have joint variable of the file. Is there some way of making synchronized writing and reading in the file?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.io\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<explanation>>>: To synchronize writing and reading in a file with multiple threads, you can use the synchronized block or method. However, since you cannot use them in this case, you can use the PrintWriter.write method to synchronize the writing process.\n\nYou can achieve this by adding a lock object to the file, which will be used to synchronize the writing process. Here's an example of how you can modify your code to use the PrintWriter.write method for synchronized writing:\n```java\npublic class A implements Runnable {\n    private File file;\n    private Thread t;\n    private ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();\n\n    public A(String patch, String fileName) {\n        t = new Thread(this);\n        CreateFile(patch, fileName);\n        //t.setDaemon(true);\n        t.start();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void run() {\n        BufferedReader reader;\n        while (!Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) {\n            try {\n                reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream(file)));\n                if (reader.readLine().charAt(0) == 'B') {\n                    lock.lock();\n                    try {\n                        PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(file);\n                        printWriter.println(\"A took file: \" + file.getName());\n                        System.out.println(\"A took file: \" + file.getName());\n                        printWriter.close();\n                    } finally {\n                        lock.unlock();\n                    }\n            } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {\n                System.out.println(\"File read A\" + e.toString());\n            } catch (IOException e) {\n                System.out.println(\"File read A\" + e.toString());\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    private void write() {\n        lock.lock();\n        try {\n            PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(file);\n            printWriter.println(\"A took file: \" + file.getName());\n            System.out.println(\"A took file: \" + file.getName());\n            printWriter.close();\n        } finally {\n            lock.unlock();\n        }\n    }\n\n    public File CreateFile(String patch, String fileName) {\n        File file = new File(patch, fileName + \".txt\");\n        try {\n            PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(file);\n            printWriter.println(\"A took file: \" + file.getName());\n            System.out.println(\"A took file: \" + file.getName());\n            printWriter.close();\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            System.out.println(\"File create A\");\n        }\n        return file;\n    }\n\n    public File FindFile(String patch, String fileName) {\n        File file = null;\n        File folder = new File(patch);\n        File[] listOfFiles = folder.listFiles();\n        BufferedReader reader;\n        for (int i = 0; i < listOfFiles.length; i++) {\n            file = listOfFiles[i];\n            if (file.getName().equals(fileName + \".txt\")) {\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        return file;\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this modified code, we have added a lock object `lock` to the `A` class. The `lock` object is a `ReentrantLock`, which allows you to acquire the lock in a non-blocking way.\n\nIn the `run()` method, we have added a try-finally block to acquire the lock before writing to the file and release the lock after writing to the file. This ensures that only one thread can write to the file at a time.\n\nWe have also modified the `write()` method to acquire the lock before writing to the file and release the lock after writing to the file.\n\nBy using the `lock` object, you can ensure that only one thread can write to the file at a time, and thus avoid the `java.lang.NullPointerException` that you were encountering earlier."}
