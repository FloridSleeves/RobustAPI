{"api": "Iterator.next", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Get data from a Collection of maps with 2 int as parameters: :I have a variable like:  Collection<Map<String, String>> allFieldValues;In this variable I have all the data of a sqlite Table, each map of the collection represents a row of the table.Now I have to take the data of a specific cell, my parameters are 2 ints (row number, column number), so I am trying something like this:Iterator<Map<String, String>> iter = allFieldValues.iterator();for (int i = 0; i == givenRowAsParameter; i++){    iter.next();}And thats it, the iter that I get out of the loop its supossed to be the row that I want, but I can't take another Iterator from that Iterator to search for the column, neither I can't get a specific object of the iterator with just an int as a parameter. So Im stuck :(Any suggestions? thanks a lot!\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next()\n<<<code>>>: Iterator<Map<String, String>> iter = allFieldValues.iterator(); for (int i = 0; i < allFieldValues.size(); i++) { if (i == givenRowAsParameter) { iter.next(); } }\n<<<explanation>>>: The code you provided is almost correct. You are iterating through the collection and checking if the current row is the one you are looking for. However, you cannot access the column values directly from the iterator. Instead, you need to store the current row in a variable and then use the column indices to access the values in the row. Here's the modified code:\n```css\nIterator<Map<String, String>> iter = allFieldValues.iterator();\nfor (int i = 0; i < allFieldValues.size(); i++) {\n    Map<String, String> row = iter.next();\n    if (row.get(String.valueOf(givenColumnAsParameter)) != null) {\n        // The column value is not null, so you can access it using row.get()\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code stores the current row in a variable `row` and checks if the value of the specified column is not null. If it's not null, you can access the column value using `row.get(columnIndex)`. Note that `columnIndex` should be an integer representing the index of the column in the row."}
