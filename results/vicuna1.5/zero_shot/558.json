USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Idiom for pairwise iteration through a sorted collection: :Is there a Java idiom for pairwise iteration through the elements of a sorted Collection? By that I mean that each iteration has access to one element of the collection and the next element of the collection?For sorted Lists (and arrays), it can be done using an index into the collection: final int n = list.size(); assert 2 <= n; for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {    final Thing thing1 = list.get(i);    final Thing thing2 = list.get(i+1);    operateOnAdjacentPair(thing1, thing2); }But what about SortedSet? (for SortedMap you can use its entrySet(), which is equivalent to the SortedSet case).So, for example, if your sorted set contained the values {1, 2, 3, 4}, the iterations would be for the pairs (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), in that order.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.util.Iterator\n<<<code>>>: Iterator iterator = mySortedSet.iterator(); while (iterator.hasNext()) { int i = iterator.next(); // access element i in the iteration }"}
