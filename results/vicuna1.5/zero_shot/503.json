Trying to remove it like in the sample code below doesn't want to work. How could I get to the iterator of current px object in this loop to remove it?    for( Pixel px : pixel){ [...]  if(px.y > gHeigh){     pixel.remove(pixel.indexOf(px)); // here is the thing     pixel.remove(px); //doesn't work either  }}\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: Iterator.next()\n<<<explanation>>>: To remove an object from an ArrayList while iterating through it in a for-each loop, you can use the Iterator.next() method to get the current object and then call the remove() method on it. In your code, you are trying to call remove() on the ArrayList itself, which is not correct. Instead, you should call remove() on the current object that you have retrieved using Iterator.next()."}
