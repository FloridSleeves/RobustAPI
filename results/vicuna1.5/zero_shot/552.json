USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Cannot convert from type object to long: :I have a hashtable named table. The type value is long. I am getting values using .values(). Now I want to access these values. Collection val = table.values();Iterator itr = val.iterator();long a  =   (long)itr.next();But when I try to get it, it gives me error because I can't convert from type object to long. How can I go around it?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "The error message \"Cannot convert from type object to long\" indicates that you are trying to assign the value returned by the `Iterator.next()` method to a variable of type `long`, but the value is of type `object`. To resolve this issue, you can use the `valueOf()` method of the `long` class to convert the value to a `long` type.\n\nHere's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to use `Iterator.next()` and `valueOf()` to get around the error:\n```java\nHashtable<String, String> table = new Hashtable<>();\n// Add some values to the table\nIterator<Map.Entry<String, String>> itr = table.entrySet().iterator();\nwhile (itr.hasNext()) {\n    Map.Entry<String, String> entry = itr.next();\n    long value = Long.valueOf(entry.getValue()); // Convert the value to a long using valueOf()\n    System.out.println(value);\n}\n```\nIn this example, we first create a `Hashtable` object named `table` and add some values to it. Then, we iterate over the entries of the table using an `Iterator` and convert the values to `long` type using the `valueOf()` method. Finally, we print the values to the console."}
