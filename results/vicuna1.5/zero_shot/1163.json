The problem statement is as follows:\n\nGiven a non-negative integer n, find the smallest positive integer that is one more than the result of flipping n coins, each with probability of heads equal to 1/2 and tails equal to 1/2.\n\nThe program reads the input from the standard input and splits it into two integers, lowerBound and upperBound. It then initializes some variables and arrays to keep track of the number of cycles and the maximum number of cycles seen so far.\n\nThe program then enters a while loop that runs until the lowerBound is greater than the upperBound. In each iteration of the loop, it sets the counter to the lowerBound and initializes the numberOfCycles to 0. It then checks if the counter has been recently used (i.e., if its value is non-zero). If it has, it increments the numberOfCycles and sets the counter to 1. If it has not, it checks if the counter is even or odd. If it is even, it divides it by 2. If it is odd, it multiplies it by 3 and adds 1. It then increments the numberOfCycles.\n\nAfter each iteration of the loop, the program updates the recently used array with the current value of the counter and checks if the numberOfCycles is greater than the maximum number of cycles seen so far. If it is, it updates the maximum number of cycles.\n\nFinally, the program prints the lowerInt, upperBound, and the maximum number of cycles seen so far.\n\nThe given code does not use the StringTokenizer class. Instead, it uses the BufferedReader class to read the input from the standard input."}
