USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Android view enum: :In Android I want to make a enum with views (let's say with EditTexts).I thought to initialize an EditText with findViewById(R.id.something), you have to do that in a activity-class or you need a instance of this class.So how can I initialize the EditTexts in a enum or can I set the Views from the main-class?I thought about something like this, but it won't work:enum Edits {    one(/* what to write here */), two(/* what to write here */);    private EditText editText;    Edits(EditText editText){        this.editText = editText;    }    EditText getEditText(){        return this.editText;    }    void setEditText(EditText editText){ // Maybe something like this?        this.editText = editText;    }}So, how would you do that?\nPlease using this api: Activity.findViewById.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: android.view.View.findViewById\n<<<code>>>: Edits.one = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.edit_one);\n<<<explanation>>>: You can use the `findViewById` method to get a reference to an `EditText` view in an enum by calling it on the `Activity` class and passing in the `R.id.edit_one` resource ID. The `Edits.one` variable will then be an instance of `EditText`."}
