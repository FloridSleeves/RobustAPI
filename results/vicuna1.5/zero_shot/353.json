USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: is there a way to skip the first entry in an iterator?: :I have some java code that takes a html table and turns it into an Iterator that I use a while loop to parse and add to a database.  My problem is the header of the table is causing me problems while I am going through my while look(since its not passing my data quality checks).  Is there a way to skip the first row?  Iterator HoldingsTableRows = HoldingsTableRows.iterator();    while (HoldingsTableRows.hasNext()) {}I could get the contents of a variable and if it matches I can break out of the loop but I'm trying to avoid hard coding anything specific to the header names because if the names of the headers change it would break my app.please help!Thanks!\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "Yes, you can use the `Iterator.next()` method to skip the first entry in an iterator.\n\nHere's an example of how you can modify your code to skip the first row:\n```java\nIterator<HoldingsTableRow> HoldingsTableRows = HoldingsTableRows.iterator();\nwhile (HoldingsTableRows.hasNext()) {\n    HoldingsTableRow row = HoldingsTableRows.next();\n    // process row here\n}\n```\nIn this example, `HoldingsTableRows.next()` will skip the first row and move to the second row in the iterator. You can then process each row in the while loop.\n\nNote that if the first row contains headers, you may need to modify your data structure to store the headers separately from the rows. Alternatively, you can modify your data quality checks to allow for the possibility of headers in the first row."}
