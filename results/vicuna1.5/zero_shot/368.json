USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Returning first key of a LinkedHashMap: :I have a LinkedHashMap in a class called YoghurtsMap<Integer, Integer>French = new LinkedHashMap<Integer, Integer>();I then made accessor methods, so that the collection could be accessed from another classI now want to GET the first key entered, but I am not sure how to do this.  int location = Yoghurts.getHashMap().entrySet().iterator().next();however this returns the error incompatible types\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next()\n<<<code>>>: Yoghurts.getHashMap().entrySet().iterator().next()\n<<<explanation>>>: This code will return the first key-value pair of the LinkedHashMap by calling the iterator.next() method on the entrySet() method of the LinkedHashMap. The iterator.next() method returns the next element in the iterator, which in this case is the first key-value pair of the LinkedHashMap."}
