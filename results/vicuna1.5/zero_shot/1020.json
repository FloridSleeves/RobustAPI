I want users to enter their request as 12+12 and return the answer. I used StringTokenizer, but I got an error and it doesn't show me any result. There was a mention that Calc is a superclass and MinusCalc and PlusCalc are subclasses. Does anyone have any idea?    void inputLineData() { // This is just the function that use for this case                                    System.out.println(\" Plz enter your all numbers\");    String strAll = key.next();    StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(strAll);    int n1 = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());    String str = st.nextToken();    int n2 =  Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());    switch (str.charAt(0)) {        case '+':            PlusCalc P = new PlusCalc(n1, n2);            listCalc[indexCalc] = P;            indexCalc++;            break;        case '-':            MinusCalc M = new MinusCalc(n1, n2);            listCalc[indexCalc] = M;            indexCalc++;            break;        default:            System.out.println(\"Error!\");      }  }And this is  MinusCalc class:   public class MinusCalc extends Calc {@Overridepublic int func(){    return n1 - n2 ; }public MinusCalc(int n1, int n2) {    super(n1, n2);   } }And this is  PlusCalc class:   public class PlusCalc extends Calc { @Overridepublic int func(){    return n1 + n2;}public PlusCalc(int n1, int n2) {    super(n1, n2);  }}And this is Calc class:    public abstract class Calc {   public Calc(int n1, int n2) { // constructor with parameters!!    this.n1 = n1;    this.n2 = n2;}int n1,n2;public abstract int func();}\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.util.StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: st.nextToken()\n<<<explanation>>>: This line of code is using the StringTokenizer class to split a string into tokens, and then calling the nextToken() method to retrieve the next token in the string. The nextToken() method returns the next token in the string, or null if the end of the string has been reached. In this case, the token being retrieved is the second number in the input string, which is then being parsed as an integer using the Integer.parseInt() method."}
