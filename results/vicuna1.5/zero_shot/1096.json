The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: List<string> Item which contains this: :I have a list stored as a text file, stored as suchId;name;functionI have a function that takes the text file and reads it in line by line, each line of text is a new item in a List. Achieved by doing the fallowing.List<String> listlist.add(line);What I am trying to do is see if some Id such as \"0x0640e331\" is in the list. And if it is get everything on the line of text that that Id is found. So the fallowing would happen,0x0604f552;name0;function0x0640e331;name1;function0x0342t521;name2;functionSearching for 0x0640e331 would return, 0x0640e331;name1;function.Any ideas?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(\"0x0640e331;name0;function0x0604f552;name1;function0x0342t521;name2;function\");\nst.nextToken();\nString id = st.nextToken();\nList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();\nwhile (st.hasMoreTokens()) {\nString line = st.nextToken();\nif (line.contains(id)) {\nlist.add(line.split(\";\")[1]);\n}\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The given code uses the StringTokenizer class to tokenize the input string containing the list of items. The first call to nextToken() removes the first token (the semicolon) from the input string. The second call to nextToken() removes the second token (the id), and the remaining tokens are added to the list. The code then uses a loop to iterate through the remaining tokens, checking each line for the id and adding the name of the function to the list if it is found."}
