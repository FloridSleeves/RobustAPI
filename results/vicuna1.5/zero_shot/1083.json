The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: MapReduce Hadoop StringTokenizer getting NoSuchElementException: :I am trying to use an output file from wordcount as an input file for a MapReduce that will show how many of each count there are (how many words appear once, twice, three times etc).I want to use the count of each word as the key, and 1 as the value, skipping over the words themselves.If the input file is something like this:422  apple 3  fruit 2  gorilla 9  monkey 3  zebra 12The output should be:2 1  3 2  9 1  12 1Using StringTokenizer to break up the file, the nextToken() in the map function below gives NoSuchElementException.public static class TokenizerMapper       extends Mapper<Object, Text, Text, IntWritable>{    private final static IntWritable one = new IntWritable(1);    private Text count = new Text();    public void map(Object key, Text value, Context context                    ) throws IOException, InterruptedException {        StringTokenizer itr = new StringTokenizer(value.toString());        itr.nextToken(); // Skip over first line, which has just one element        while (itr.hasMoreTokens()) {            itr.nextToken(); // Skip over word            count.set(itr.nextToken()); // save count as key            context.write(count, one);        }    }}  I'm not sure why or how to fix it?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: StringTokenizer itr = new StringTokenizer(value.toString()); itr.nextToken();\n<<<explanation>>>: The issue with the given code is that the `nextToken()` method is being called before the `StringTokenizer` object `itr` has been initialized. To fix this, you should initialize the `itr` object with the `value` parameter before calling `nextToken()`. This will allow the `nextToken()` method to skip over the first line of the input file, which has just one element, and proceed to the next token."}
