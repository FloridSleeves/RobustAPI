My question is what is causing this exception?  Thanks\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: PrintToFile.printExp(ArrayList<Expense> expList)\n<<<explanation>>>: The exception is caused by the PrintWriter.write method trying to write to a null output stream. This can happen if the PrintWriter object is not properly initialized or if the FileWriter object is not properly initialized and the PrintWriter object is assigned to it. In the PrintToFile class, the FileWriter object is not properly initialized, so when the PrintWriter object is assigned to it, it tries to write to a null output stream, causing a NullPointerException."}
