(codes changed)class Threading extends Thread{Socket server;Socket client;StringBuilder Request;Threading(Socket sck,Socket srv){    client = sck;    server = srv;    Request = new StringBuilder();}@Overridepublic void run() {    try    {        DataOutputStream clientout = new DataOutputStream(client.getOutputStream());        BufferedReader clientinput = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(client.getInputStream()));        System.out.println(\"---------REQUEST--------\");        String tmp =\"THIS\";        while((tmp=clientinput.readLine())!=null)        {            Request = Request.append(tmp);        }        System.out.println(Request.toString());//Request is empty!!!

Additionally, the getBytes() method of the String class returns an array of bytes, which needs to be converted to a DataOutputStream using the write() method. Therefore, the code should be modified as follows:\n\nRequest = Request.append(tmp).toString().getBytes();\nDataOutputStream srvout = new DataOutputStream(server.getOutputStream());\nsrvout.write(Request.getBytes());\nwhile((tmp=srvin.readLine())!=null)\n{\nclientout.write(tmp.getBytes());\n}"}
