USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to replace a element in list of objects from another list: :I have a List of ImagesList<Image> images = getImages();Image.javapublic class Image {    private String imageId;    // getter and setter methods    // ...}And I have a List<String> imageIds to replace the imageId in each Image object. What would be the best way to do it?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: images.iterator().next()\n<<<explanation>>>: This code uses the Iterator.next() method to retrieve the first element in the Iterator object returned by the images.iterator() method. This allows you to access the first element in the list and modify it as needed. In this case, you can use the imageIds list to replace the imageId property of the Image object."}
