USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java, Linked List of Item objects. How to refer to the current item?: :I have a class which holds a linked list of Item objects. I want this class to hold the \"current\" Item somehow so I can refer to it in other parts of the program. Is the best way to do this to create a Item object within my class and set it equal to the \"current\" Item when I wish to set it?as such:for(int i = 0; i < [LinkedListofItems].length(); i++)    {Item currentItem = [LinkedListofItems].getAt(i); break;}And then if I would like to set and Items attributes equal to anothers I would override the = operator?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: Iterator iterator = [LinkedListofItems].iterator(); Item currentItem = iterator.next();\n<<<explanation>>>: The best way to refer to the current Item in a Linked List of Items is to use the Iterator class. You can create an Iterator object for the LinkedList of Items using the iterator() method, and then use the next() method to get the current Item. The currentItem variable will hold the current Item in the list. You can then set the attributes of the currentItem to those of another Item object."}
