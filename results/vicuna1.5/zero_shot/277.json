USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to implement a jump iterator: :Implement next() and hasNext() of a jump iterator, the constructor was passed with another iterator. The next() function will return iterator.next().next()I have implemented below code, it doesn't look elegant at all.And for list {1, 9, 8, 7, 8, 2, 5}, it will only output 9, 7, 2.Any clue to do it in a better way?Basically this jump iterator is trying to iterator each element with one distance, for example, for 1,2,3,4,5, it will return 1,3,5public class JumpIterator implements Iterator<Integer> {    private Iterator<Integer> it;    public JumpIterator(List<Integer> list){        it = list.iterator();    }    @Override    public boolean hasNext() {        if(!it.hasNext()){            return false;        }else{            it.next();            return it.hasNext();        }    }    @Override    public Integer next() {        return it.next();    }}\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next()\n<<<code>>>: Iterator.next().next()\n<<<explanation>>>: This will return the next element in the iterator, then the next element after that, effectively jumping to the next element in the list. This can be used to implement a jump iterator."}
