{"api": "DataOutputStream.write", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How do I send Http trailers/footers in a chunked response from within a java servlet?: :Basically my response headers containTransfer-encoding=chunked,Trailer=[some trailer I want to send say e.g \"SomeTrailer\"]Once I'm done writing the data to the Servlet outputstream, I'm writing the trailer\"SomeTrailer:[value]\", but this is not being parsed by the httpclient correctly. The httpclient considers the whole of inputstream (including the trailer) as a singlechunk.   I've also tried writing the trailer in a response header after the data has been written to the outputstream but without success.Please helpI haven't found any good sources on this. \nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "To send Http trailers/footers in a chunked response from within a Java Servlet, you can use the `DataOutputStream.write` method to write the trailer to the output stream before sending the data. Here's an example code snippet:\n\n<<<code>>>:\n```java\nimport java.io.DataOutputStream;\nimport java.io.IOException;\n\nimport javax.servlet.ServletException;\nimport javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet;\nimport javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;\nimport javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;\n\npublic class MyServlet extends HttpServlet {\n    protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)\n            throws ServletException, IOException {\n        // Set the content type and transfer encoding to chunked\n        response.setContentType(\"text/plain\");\n        response.setHeader(\"Transfer-Encoding\", \"chunked\");\n\n        // Create a DataOutputStream to write the response\n        DataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(response.getOutputStream());\n\n        // Write the trailer to the DataOutputStream\n        dos.writeBytes(\"SomeTrailer: value\");\n\n        // Write the data to the DataOutputStream\n        dos.writeBytes(\"Some data\");\n\n        // Flush the DataOutputStream to send the response\n        dos.flush();\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, we first set the content type and transfer encoding to chunked. Then, we create a `DataOutputStream` to write the response and write the trailer to it before writing the data. Finally, we flush the `DataOutputStream` to send the response.\n\nExplanation:\nThe `DataOutputStream.write` method is used to write the trailer to the output stream. The `writeBytes` method is used to write the trailer to the stream as a byte array. The `:` character is used to separate the trailer name from its value.\n\nNote that the trailer should be written before the data, otherwise the httpclient will consider the whole of inputstream (including the trailer) as a single chunk.\n\nAlso, it's worth noting that the `DataOutputStream` is not a part of the standard Java API, it's a part of the Apache Commons IO library, so you need to add the following dependency to your project:\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>org.apache.commons</groupId>\n    <artifactId>commons-io</artifactId>\n    <version>1.3.2</version>\n</dependency>\n```"}
