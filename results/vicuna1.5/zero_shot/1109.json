USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Simple java file reader not working: :I am creating a program where two numbers are read from one file (test.in) and then the sum is output to another file (test.out). I created the two files as TXT documents in the bin folder of my project but it still gives this Exception in thread \"main\" java.io.FileNotFoundException: test.in.txt (The system cannot find the file specified)    at java.io.FileInputStream.open0(Native Method)    at java.io.FileInputStream.open(Unknown Source)    at java.io.FileInputStream.<init>(Unknown Source)    at java.io.FileInputStream.<init>(Unknown Source)    at java.io.FileReader.<init>(Unknown Source)    at test.main(test.java:11)The files are not showing up in my project directory on the left hand side of the screen, it just won't work.import java.io.*;import java.util.*;public class test {    public static void main (String [] args) throws IOException {        BufferedReader f = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"test.in.txt\"));        PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(\"test.out.txt\")));        StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(f.readLine());        int i1 = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());    // first integer        int i2 = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());    // second integer        out.println(i1+i2);                           // output result        out.close();                                  // close the output file      }}\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.util.StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(f.readLine());\n<<<explanation>>>: The issue with the code is that the file \"test.in.txt\" cannot be found by the program. The problem is with the file path provided to the FileReader constructor. Instead of using \"test.in.txt\", the file should be accessed using its absolute path or relative path from the current working directory. Additionally, the BufferedReader and PrintWriter should be closed after use to avoid any resource leaks."}
