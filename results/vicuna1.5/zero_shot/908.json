I can't do this manually as there are well over 5000 files.How can I make it delete this specific line in all of the files?\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.lang.String.getBytes()\n<<<code>>>: String.getBytes(char[] c, int off, int len)\n<<<explanation>>>: The code is using the getBytes() method of the String class to convert the line containing \"char-15\" to a byte array. This method takes three arguments: an array of characters, the starting index of the characters to convert, and the number of characters to convert. The resulting byte array is then being printed to the console using the println() method. However, this method does not delete the line from the file. To delete the line from the file, you need to use the delete() method of the File class."}
