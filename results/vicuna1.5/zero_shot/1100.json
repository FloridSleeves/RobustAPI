The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: java regular expression get substring: :I can't find any good resource for parsing with regular expression. Could someone please show me the way.How can I parse this statement?\"Breakpoint 10, main () at file.c:10\"I want get the substring \"main ()\" or 3rd word of the statement.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.util.StringTokenizer\n<<<code>>>: StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(\"Breakpoint 10, main () at file.c:10\");\nst.nextToken();\nString sub = st.nextToken();\n<<<explanation>>>: To parse the given statement using regular expression, we can use the StringTokenizer class in Java. The code first creates a StringTokenizer object named \"st\" and passes the given statement as a parameter. Then, it calls the nextToken() method of the StringTokenizer object to remove the first token of the statement, which is \"Breakpoint 10,\" and stores it in the \"sub\" variable. Finally, it calls the nextToken() method again to get the third word of the statement, which is \"main ()\"."}
