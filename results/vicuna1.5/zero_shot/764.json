I think it is problem with OutpubStream, because I display data on previous steps, and they were correct.private void Output(File file2) {    // TODO Auto-generated method stub    OutputStream os;    try {        os = new FileOutputStream(file2); //file2-it is my output file, all normal with him        Iterator<Integer> e=mass.iterator();        int r=0;        while(e.hasNext()){            r=e.next();             System.out.println(r);//display data-all be correct        os.write(r);//I think problem create in this step/        }        os.close();    } catch (IOException e) {        // TODO Auto-generated catch block        e.printStackTrace();    }} Input data file1.txt1056233452115685485Output data file2.txt 3 strahge tokens plus !-68DU  thanks for answers, excuse me for my english. \nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write.\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(file2);\nwhile (e.hasNext()) {\nr = e.next();\nwriter.println(r);\n}\nwriter.close();\n\nExplanation:\nThe issue with the previous code is that it is using the FileOutputStream class to write the data to the file, which writes the data in a binary format. To write the data in a text format, we need to use the PrintWriter class instead. The PrintWriter class allows us to write text data to a file in a human-readable format.\n\nIn the updated code, we create a PrintWriter object and assign it to the file2 variable. We then loop through the data and write each integer value to the file using the println() method of the PrintWriter class. Finally, we close the PrintWriter object to ensure that the file is properly closed.\n\nBy using the PrintWriter.write method, we can ensure that the data is written to the file in a human-readable format, which should display correctly when the file is opened."}
