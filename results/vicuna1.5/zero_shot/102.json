USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java, Sending data to different IPs: :I am making a simple chat client for fun, I have the Server/Client working and sending data perfectly. I would like to know how I can send data to selected users. The selecting part I can work out, but I don't know how to send things to the selected IPs. Here is my server so far.package Server;import java.io.DataInputStream;import java.io.DataOutputStream;import java.io.IOException;import java.net.ServerSocket;import java.net.Socket;/** * @class Connect * @date Feb 25, 2013 10:14:00 PM * @author Zach */public class Connect { //Server    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {        ServerSocket server = new ServerSocket(43595);        while (server.isBound()) {            Socket s = server.accept();            DataOutputStream out = new DataOutputStream(s.getOutputStream());            DataInputStream in = new DataInputStream(s.getInputStream());            int length = in.read();            byte[] data = new byte[length];            in.read(data);            String str = new String(data, \"UTF-8\");            s.close();        }    }}I want to redirect information off of the server to a specific client\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.io.DataOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>: out.write(data)\n<<<explanation>>>: To send data to a specific client, you can use the client's IP address and port number to send the data directly to that client. You can use the DataOutputStream.write method to write the data to the output stream, and then use the Socket.getOutputStream() method to get the output stream for the client's socket. Once you have the output stream, you can use the write method to send the data to the client. Here is an example:\n```\nSocket client = ... // get the client socket\nDataOutputStream out = new DataOutputStream(client.getOutputStream());\n// write data to out\nout.write(data);\n```\nYou can also use the DataInputStream.read method to read data from the input stream of the client's socket.\n```\nDataInputStream in = new DataInputStream(client.getInputStream());\n// read data from in\nint length = in.read();\nbyte[] data = new byte[length];\nin.read(data);\nString str = new String(data, \"UTF-8\");\n```\nPlease note that you need to have the client's IP address and port number to send the data to the correct client."}
