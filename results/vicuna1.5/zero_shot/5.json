In this class I have some variables and I'd like to use them in another class. This is the code:public class SearchView {    private MenuActivity menuActivity;    public SearchView() {        menuActivity = new MenuActivity();        menuActivity.searchButton = (ImageView) menuActivity.findViewById(R.id.searchButton);    }}Last line gives me a NullPointerException. I know I need to initialize it but how can I initialize an activity?\nPlease using this api: Activity.findViewById.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: android.view.View.findViewById\n<<<code>>>: searchButton = (ImageView) menuActivity.findViewById(R.id.searchButton);\n<<<explanation>>>: To initialize an activity, you need to first create an instance of the activity class and then call the \"findViewById\" method on the activity object to get a reference to the view with the specified ID. In this case, you are trying to get a reference to an ImageView with the ID \"searchButton\" in the \"menuActivity\" object."}
