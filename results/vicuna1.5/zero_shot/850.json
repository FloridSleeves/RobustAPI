USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to read a binary file starting from a specific part: :What I did in my code was to simply append a tag then some string data to a binary file using the append flag of FileOutputStream. Now, how do I read starting from the tag specified? I'm not sure where to start. The file and string sizes are variable so I couldn't really trust it. The only thing constant is the tag.EDIT: I forgot to mention that the file will be accessed from another thread/activity/app/device.Code used for appending some data:String TAG = \"CLIPPYDATA-\";String content = \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\"; //size not fixed, sample purpose only.FileOutputStream output = new FileOutputStream(\"/path/to/file\", true);try {        output.write((TAG + content).getBytes());} finally {        //output.flush(); (should I?)        output.close();}Sample output:yyvA\u017e\u00ee\u00e9\u00c3I&8Q\u00c0 \u00d8 +Z\u0160( \u00a2\u0160( \u00a2\u0160(\u00ff\u00d9CLIPPYDATA-The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.Sample input:yyvA\u017e\u00ee\u00e9\u00c3I&8Q\u00c0 \u00d8 +Z\u0160( \u00a2\u0160( \u00a2\u0160(\u00ff\u00d9CLIPPYDATA-The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.Desired Output:CLIPPYDATA-The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: RandomAccessFile.read\n<<<code>>>: RandomAccessFile file = new RandomAccessFile(\"/path/to/file\", \"r\");file.seek(file.length() - TAG.length);String content = file.readLine();file.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: To read the file starting from the specified tag, you can use the RandomAccessFile class. First, create a new RandomAccessFile object and open the file in read mode. Then, seek to the end of the file using the seek method and set the position to the end of the tag using the length of the tag as the argument. Finally, read the line of the file using the readLine method and close the file using the close method. This will give you the desired output."}
