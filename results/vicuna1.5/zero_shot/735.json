Improve this question                    My java program only writes one line to txt file.code:Main:package hu.hymosi.tut;import java.io.FileNotFoundException;import java.io.PrintWriter;import java.util.Random;public class Main {public static void main(String[] args) {    PrintWriter out = null;    frameworkcucc fw = new frameworkcucc();    for (int i = 1; i < 100; i++) {        Random rand = new Random();        System.out.println(i);        try {            out = new PrintWriter(\"valtozok.txt\");        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {            // TODO Auto-generated catch block            e.printStackTrace();        }        int kiirando = rand.nextInt();        fw.writetotext(kiirando, out);    }}}frameworkcucc:package hu.hymosi.tut;import java.io.PrintWriter;public class frameworkcucc {public void writetotext(int write, PrintWriter writer) {    writer.print(write + \"\\n\");}}If i run the program it just writes one line to my txt file.What is the bug and how can i solve it?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "The issue with the code is that the PrintWriter object is being closed after the for loop, which causes the remaining writings to be lost. To fix this, the PrintWriter object should be closed only when the program is finished executing.\n\nHere's the modified code:\n```java\nimport java.io.FileNotFoundException;\nimport java.io.PrintWriter;\nimport java.util.Random;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        PrintWriter out = null;\n        frameworkcucc fw = new frameworkcucc();\n        for (int i = 1; i < 100; i++) {\n            Random rand = new Random();\n            System.out.println(i);\n            try {\n                out = new PrintWriter(\"valtozok.txt\");\n            } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {\n                // TODO Auto-generated catch block\n                e.printStackTrace();\n            }\n            int kiirando = rand.nextInt();\n            fw.writetotext(kiirando, out);\n        }\n        try {\n            out.close();\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nAnd the explanation:\n\nThe PrintWriter object is used to write to a file. However, the object is being closed inside the for loop, which means that all the writings inside the loop are lost. To fix this, the PrintWriter object should be closed only when the program is finished executing, which is after the for loop. Therefore, the try-catch block is used to catch any IOException that may occur when trying to close the PrintWriter object, and the finally block is used to ensure that the PrintWriter object is closed regardless of whether an exception occurs or not."}
