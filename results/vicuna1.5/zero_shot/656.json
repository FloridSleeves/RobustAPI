Object createResult = rpcClient.execute(\"Bug.search\", new Object[]{bugMap});how do i get bugs information from : \"createResult\" object.ie, contents of cretaeResult object.According to Bugzilla documentation two items are returned, bugs and faults, both are array of hashes. and i want to access these.\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.util.HashMap.get()\n<<<code>>>: createResult.get(\"Bug.search\")\n<<<explanation>>>: To access the contents of the \"createResult\" object, you can use the \"get\" method of the \"HashMap\" class. In this case, you are accessing the value associated with the key \"Bug.search\". The value could be an array of hashes, which contains the information of the bugs and faults."}
