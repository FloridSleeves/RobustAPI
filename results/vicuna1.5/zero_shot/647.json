However, you are trying to retrieve the value using the key \"bagItems\" which is not a valid key in the HashMap. Also, you are trying to store a List<Bag> in the HashMap with the key \"bagItems\" which is not a primitive data type. To fix the issue, you should use the correct key to retrieve the value and make sure that the key is of a primitive data type."}
