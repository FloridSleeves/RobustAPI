The while loop continues to execute as long as the hasMoreTokens() method returns true, which is true as long as there are more tokens to be extracted. In each iteration of the loop, the nextToken() method is called to retrieve the next token, which is then printed to the console. This way, all the tokens in the input string are printed out."}
