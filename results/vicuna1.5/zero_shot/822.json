USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to Clear a text file without deleting it?: :I am wondering what the best way to clear a file is. I know that java automatically creates a file with f = new Formatter(\"jibberish.txt\");  s = new Scanner(\"jibberish.txt\");if none already exists. But what if one exists and I want to clear it every time I run the program? That is what I am wondering: to say it again how do I clear a file that already exists to just be blank? Here is what I was thinking: public void clearFile(){    //go through and do this every time in order to delete previous crap    while(s.hasNext()){        f.format(\" \");    }} \nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"jibberish.txt\"); writer.write(\"\"); writer.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: This code will clear the contents of the file \"jibberish.txt\" by writing an empty string to it using the PrintWriter.write() method. The PrintWriter class is used to write text to a file, and the write() method is used to write a string to the file. In this case, the string being written is an empty string, which will clear the contents of the file. The close() method is used to close the PrintWriter, which is necessary to ensure that the file is properly closed and any resources used by the PrintWriter are freed."}
