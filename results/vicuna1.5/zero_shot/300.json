USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Iterating over list of arrays: :I have a setup that looks like this:List<int[]> list = new LinkedList<int[]>();list.add(new int[] {1, 3, 4});list.add(new int[] {4, 5});list.add(new int[] {1, 4, 6});I do not know the size of the arrays while writing the code. I am trying to iterate through the whole setup to generate all possible combinations:141      144      146      151      154      156      341      ...I am currently using recursion to achieve this:public static void recursive(List<int[]> list) {    recursive(list, 0, \"\");}private static void recursive(List<int[]> list, int counter, String string)  {    if (counter == list.size())        System.out.println(string);    else        for (int i: list.get(counter))            recursive(list, counter + 1, string + i);}I have 2 questions about this:I remember hearing the recursion can always be replaced by loops in some lecture, but I can't do it for this case. How would a loop version of this look?Is there a better way to solve this problem?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.util.Iterator\n<<<code>>>: Iterator iterator = list.iterator();while (iterator.hasNext()) {int[] arr = iterator.next();// do something with arr}"}
