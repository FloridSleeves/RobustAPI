{"api": "Iterator.next", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java synchronised iterators?: :I'm looking for a way to call a method that returns from the the called object, an iterable collection, the source (the collection instance in the called object) of which will prevent simultaneous access by other threads.I would imagine this iterable collection would be wrapped in a class in which was provided a synchronisation mechnanism such that when the caller was finished with the collection it might call a method called finished() that would release the lock on the underlying collection object. Although the API's have the methods that return synchronised versions of common collections, there seems to be no way to programmatically release the lock by calling a finished method; AFAICT the lock appears to be released when the wrapper is garbage collected.Is there anything that does this in the Java SE API, or is it considered easy enough just to roll something myself? Thanks for your constructive input.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.util.Iterator.next()\n<<<code>>>: Iterator iterator = myCollection.iterator(); iterator.next();\n<<<explanation>>>: The method Iterator.next() returns the next element in the iterator's iteration, and it is not synchronized. If you want to ensure that only one thread can access the collection at a time, you can use the synchronized version of the Iterator interface, which is called \"SynchronizedIterator\". However, this interface is not part of the Java SE API, it is part of the Guava library. You can use it by importing \"com.google.common.collect.SynchronizedIterator\" and then use it on your collection object."}
