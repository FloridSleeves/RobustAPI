I am trying to make it so that if the enemies are within a certain distance of the ammos, then the enemys remove themselves from the screen. I have attempted to do it and the code compiles, but i am unsure why the enemys arent being removed from the screen once been hit. Can anyone see anything wrong with the code below? Thankyoufor (TopEnemy i : newTopEnemy){    for (int q = 0; q < ammo.length; q++)    {       float xsubs = i.enemyX - ammo[q].positionX;       float ysubs = i.enemyY - ammo[q].positionY;       float squared = (xsubs * xsubs) + (ysubs * ysubs);       float distance = (float)Math.sqrt(squared);       if (distance < 10.0)       {          newTopEnemy.remove(q);       }    } }  \nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: Iterator.next()\n<<<explanation>>>: The issue with the code is that the `Iterator.next()` method is called inside the loop, which means that the next element in the list is retrieved and processed for each iteration. However, the `remove()` method is called on the list itself, which removes the element from the list and returns it as an object. Therefore, the code should be modified to store the removed element in a separate variable and then use the `remove()` method on the stored variable instead of the list itself. Here's an example of how the code could be modified:\n```kotlin\nfor (int q = 0; q < ammo.length; q++) {\n    float xsubs = i.enemyX - ammo[q].positionX;\n    float ysubs = i.enemyY - ammo[q].positionY;\n    float squared = (xsubs * xsubs) + (ysubs * ysubs);\n    float distance = (float)Math.sqrt(squared);\n    if (distance < 10.0) {\n        Object removed = newTopEnemy.remove(q);\n        // Do something with the removed object, if necessary\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this modified code, the `remove()` method is called on the `newTopEnemy` list and the returned object is stored in the `removed` variable. This allows the code to access the removed element and perform any necessary actions on it."}
