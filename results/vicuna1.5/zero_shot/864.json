USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to append to AES encrypted file: :I'm writing some kind of logger that produces encrypted log-file. Unfortunately, cryptography is not my strong side. Now I can write to file several messages and then close file. Then i can open it, append some messages, close again and after decryption I see padding bytes in the middle of file. Is there any way to work with encrypted file without having to decrypt it every time I want to append some messages?EDIT: little more details. Current implementation utlizes CipherOutputStream. As i understand there's no way to seek using it.Can i use 'NoPadding' option if i will control that output data size is divisible by block size?\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: RandomAccessFile.write\n<<<code>>>: file.seek(file.length() - 10); // assuming padding bytes are 10 bytes long\nfile.write(\"New message\".getBytes());\nfile.write(new byte[10]); // padding bytes\nfile.write(\"More messages\".getBytes());\nfile.write(new byte[10]); // padding bytes\nfile.close();\n\n<<<explanation>>>: Yes, you can use the 'NoPadding' option if you control the output data size is divisible by the block size. In your case, since you know that the padding bytes are 10 bytes long, you can seek to the end of the file and write the new message and padding bytes without decrypting the entire file. However, you need to make sure that the new message and padding bytes are padded with the same padding scheme as the original file."}
