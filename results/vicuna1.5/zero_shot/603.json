If you want to display all the items in the list, you can use a for loop to iterate through the list and add each item to the widget. To display the items with a next button, you can use a ListView widget. Here's an example:\n```\nList<String> items = List.of(\"Item 1\", \"Item 2\", \"Item 3\");\n\nWidget build(BuildContext context) {\n  return ListView.builder(\n    itemCount: items.length,\n    itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int index) {\n      return ListTile(\n        title: Text(items[index]),\n      );\n    },\n  );\n}\n```\nThis will create a ListView with the items in the list displayed as ListTiles. You can use a next button to navigate through the items by adding a onTap function to the ListTile widget.\n```\nListTile(\n  title: Text(items[index]),\n  onTap: () {\n    setState(() {\n      index++;\n    });\n  },\n)\n```\nThis will cause the index to increment by 1 when the ListTile is tapped, which will cause the ListView to display the next item in the list."}
