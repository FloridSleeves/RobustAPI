USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: getting a specific number of bits from a file java: :I am trying to make a code that read blocks of 17 bits from a file and I have no idea of how to get this done, I mean that I will have any file and need to read the next 17 bits to apply a crc algorithm\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: InputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream(\"path/to/file.txt\");\nint numBits = 17;\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[numBits/8];\nint bytesRead = inputStream.read(buffer);\nint bitPosition = 0;\nfor (int i = 0; i < bytesRead; i++) {\nbyte b = buffer[i];\nint bitValue = (b & 0x80) > 0 ? 1 : 0;\nbitPosition += bitValue;\n}\nint next17Bits = bitPosition;\n<<<explanation>>>: To read blocks of 17 bits from a file using the InputStream.read method, you first need to create an InputStream object by passing the file path to the FileInputStream constructor. Then, you need to create a byte array of size 17, which will be used to store the 17 bits read from the file. You can use the InputStream.read method to read the specified number of bytes from the file and store them in the byte array. Finally, you can iterate through the byte array and extract the 17 most significant bits by checking the 8th bit of each byte and incrementing the bit position accordingly. The resulting bit position will be the next 17 bits that you need to apply the CRC algorithm."}
