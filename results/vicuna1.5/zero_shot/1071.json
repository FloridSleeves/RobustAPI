Here is a few lines of the text file:Mary Smith 1 James Johnson 2 Patricia Williams 3 I am trying to break up into first name, last name and Customer ID. I have so far been able to do that but it stops after mary smith. Here is my code:  public static void createCustomerList(BufferedReader infileCust,            CustomerList customerList) throws IOException{                String  firstName;            String  lastName;            int  custId;            //take first line of strings before breaking them up to first last and cust ID            String StringToBreak = infileCust.readLine();            //split up the string with string tokenizer            StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(StringToBreak);            firstName = st.nextToken();            while(st.hasMoreElements())            {            lastName =  st.nextToken();            custId = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());            CustomerElement CustomerObject = new CustomerElement();            CustomerObject.setCustInfo(firstName,lastName,custId);            customerList.addToList(CustomerObject);            }    }\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: infileCust.readLine()\n<<<explanation>>>: The code is reading the first line of the text file and assigning it to the variable \"StringToBreak\". Then, it is using a StringTokenizer to split the string into three parts: first name, last name, and customer ID. However, the code is only extracting the first name and last name, and not the customer ID. The reason for this is that the nextToken() method of the StringTokenizer class returns the next token in the string, but it does not return the token after the last one. Therefore, the code is only able to extract the first two tokens, and not the third one."}
