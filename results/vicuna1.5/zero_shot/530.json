USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java: How to know if TIFF image is Group4?: :Is it possible to know if a TIFF image is Group4 using a JAVA program?Thank you.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next()\n<<<code>>>: Iterator<TiffImage> iterator = tiffImageList.iterator();\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\nTiffImage tiffImage = iterator.next();\nif (tiffImage.isGroup4()) {\n// TIFF image is Group4\n}\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: Yes, it is possible to know if a TIFF image is Group4 using a JAVA program. You can iterate through a list of TIFF images and use the `Iterator.next()` method to check if each image is Group4. If the image is Group4, you can perform the necessary actions in the code block provided."}
