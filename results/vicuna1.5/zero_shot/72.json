{"api": "DataOutputStream.write", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: What Java class allows to write to a file, both in Binary and ASCII?: :I need to write files, with Headers in ASCII and values in Binary.For now, I'm using this:File file = new File(\"~/myfile\");FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(file);// Write in ASCIIout.write((\"This is a header\\n\").getBytes());// Write a byte[] is quite easybyte[] buffer = new buffer[4];out.write(buffer, 0, 4);// Write an int in binary gets complicatedout.write(ByteBuffer.allocate(4).putInt(6).array());//Write a float in binary gets even more complicatedout.write(ByteBuffer.allocate(4).order(ByteOrder.BIG_ENDIAN)        .putFloat(4.5).array());The problem is that it's very slow (in terms of performance) to write that way, way slower than writing the values in ASCII actually. But it should be shorter since in I'm writing less data.I've looked at other Java classes, and it seems to me that they are either only for ASCII writing, or only for Binary writing.Would you have any other proposition for this problem ?\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.io.DataOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>: DataOutputStream out = new DataOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(\"~/myfile\"));\nout.writeUTF(\"This is a header\"); // Write in ASCII\nout.writeInt(6); // Write a int in binary\nout.writeFloat(4.5f); // Write a float in binary\n<<<explanation>>>: The DataOutputStream class provides a way to write data to a file in a binary format while still allowing you to write ASCII strings. The writeUTF() method is used to write a string in ASCII, the writeInt() method is used to write an int in binary, and the writeFloat() method is used to write a float in binary. By using the DataOutputStream, you can write both ASCII and binary data in a single file, making it more efficient than writing the data separately in ASCII and binary formats."}
