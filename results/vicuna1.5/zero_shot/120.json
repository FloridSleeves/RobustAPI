Thanks in advance.Here is the sending server-thread codetry{       out.println(\"AcceptFile,\");    FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(fn);    byte[] buffer = new byte[fis.available()];    fis.read(buffer);    ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream()) ;    oos.writeObject(buffer);    oos.flush();}catch(Exception c){    System.err.println(\"exc\" + c);}Here is the Client-thread receivingtry{    ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(socket.getInputStream());                    byte[] buffer = (byte[])ois.readObject();                    String pic=\"copy\"+studId+\".pdf\";                    System.out.println(pic);                    FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(pic);                    fos.write(buffer);                      fos.flush();                    fos.close();    }catch(Exception e){    System.out.println(\"Exception writing\");}\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: DataOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>:\n```java\nDataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());\ndos.writeInt(buffer.length);\ndos.write(buffer);\ndos.flush();\n```\n<<<explanation>>>:\nThe issue with the previous code was that it was using an ObjectOutputStream to write the file, which is designed to write object serialization data, not raw file data. To fix this, you can use a DataOutputStream to write the raw file data directly to the socket output stream. The DataOutputStream class provides a writeInt() method to write the file length and a write() method to write the actual file data. By calling flush() after writing the data, you can ensure that it is sent to the client immediately."}
