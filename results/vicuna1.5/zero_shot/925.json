USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: String to byte convertion in java: :i m new in java....i m trying to read a text file using file input stream. i m reading text line by line and set as a string.. now i want to convert string into byte. but i m getting a number format exception.. please help me to solve this problem.FileInputStream fstream = new FileInputStream(\"C:/Users/data.txt\");          DataInputStream in = new DataInputStream(fstream);          BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(in));          byte[] bytes = null;          String str;          int i=0;          while ((str = br.readLine()) != null)           {              bytes[i] = Byte.parseByte(str,16);              i++;          }          in.close();\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.lang.String.getBytes()\n<<<code>>>: String str = br.readLine();\nbyte[] bytes = str.getBytes();\n<<<explanation>>>: The issue with the original code is that it is trying to parse the string as a byte using Byte.parseByte() method with a radix of 16, which is not necessary. Instead, you can use the String.getBytes() method to convert the string to a byte array. This method returns an array of bytes that represent the characters in the string in some platform-dependent encoding. So, you can simply call String.getBytes() on the string returned by BufferedReader.readLine() method and assign it to the byte array variable."}
