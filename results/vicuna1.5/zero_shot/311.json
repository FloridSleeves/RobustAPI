{"api": "Iterator.next", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java get image extension/type using BufferedImage from URL: :I am familiar with working with images. I retrieve/read an image from a URL, where the URL does not have a file extension. Then I wish to write/save the image to the local storage, but I have to specify the image file extension (i.e. JPG, PNG, etc.), which I cannot retrieve its extension through the BufferedImage.Could one please point out how it can be done?Any other method will do.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.util.Iterator.next()\n<<<code>>>: Iterator<BufferedImage> iterator = bufferedImage.getImages(); iterator.next();\n<<<explanation>>>: To get the first image from an Iterator of BufferedImage objects, you can use the \"next\" method. This will return the next image in the Iterator, which you can then use to retrieve the image's file extension."}
