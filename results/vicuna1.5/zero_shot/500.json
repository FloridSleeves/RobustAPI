USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to switch between two windows in browser using Selenium java: :I'm working with Selenium Automation. In this, When i click a link in a current window, a new window opens. I just want to switch the control to the new window. But i can't do this.Actually the new window is an auto-generated one. That is, link will be generated dynamically. Help me friends...\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next()\n<<<code>>>: driver.switchTo().window(Iterator.next());\n<<<explanation>>>: This code uses the Iterator.next() method to switch to the next available window in the browser. The driver.switchTo().window() method takes a parameter that specifies the window to switch to, and in this case, it is set to Iterator.next(), which will iterate through all the available windows and switch to the next one. This will allow you to switch control to the new window that is generated dynamically by the link click."}
