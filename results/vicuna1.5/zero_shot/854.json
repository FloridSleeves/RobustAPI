The code is as followsRandomAccessFile in = new RandomAccessFile('BOT.GRD', \"r\");in.read(a);Now I want to choose file dynamically rather than providing directly as above. I tried a lot and I was unable to do that. Can any one help me on this?\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: RandomAccessFile.read()\n<<<code>>>: in.read(a);\n<<<explanation>>>: To read binary data from a file using the RandomAccessFile class, you can use the read() method. This method reads a specified number of bytes from the file and stores them in an array. In your code, you are reading the data into the variable \"a\"."}
