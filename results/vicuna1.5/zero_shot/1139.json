The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to get substring based on special characters in android?: :Actually this is a very simple question, I tried a lot but I am unable to get the exact solution. I have a string like:String mystring = \"one<1234567>,two<98765432>,three<878897656>\";Here I want the data which is inside \"<\" and \">\". Can anyone help me with this?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(mystring, \",\");\nst.nextToken(); // gets the first token\nString subString = st.nextToken(); // gets the second token\nwhile (st.hasMoreTokens()) {\nString token = st.nextToken();\nif (token.startsWith(\"<\") && token.endsWith(\">\")) {\nsubString += token;\n}\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: This code uses the StringTokenizer class to split the input string into tokens based on the comma delimiter. It then gets the second token using the nextToken() method and stores it in the variable \"subString\". The code then uses a while loop to check if the next token starts with \"<\" and ends with \">\" using the startsWith() and endsWith() methods respectively. If the condition is true, it adds the token to the subString variable. This way, the code can extract all the substrings that are enclosed within \"<>\" characters in the input string."}
