USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Safely reading http request headers in java: :I'm building my own HTTP webserver in java and would like to implement some security measures while reading the http request header from a socket inputstream.I'm trying to prevent scenario's where someone sending extremely long single line headers or absurd amounts of header lines would cause memory overflows or other things you wouldn't want.I'm currently trying to do this by reading 8kb of data into a byte array and parse all the headers within the buffer I just created.But as far as I know this means your inputstream's current offset is always already 8kb from it's starting point, even if you had only 100bytes of header.the code I have so far:InputStream stream = socket.getInputStream();HashMap<String, String> headers = new HashMap<String, String>();byte [] buffer = new byte[8*1024];stream.read( buffer , 0 , 8*1024);ByteArrayInputStream bytestream = new ByteArrayInputStream( buffer );InputStreamReader streamReader = new InputStreamReader( bytestream );BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader( streamReader );String requestline = reader.readLine();for ( ;; ){    String line = reader.readLine();    if ( line.equals( \"\" ) )        break;    String[] header = line.split( \":\" , 2 );    headers.put( header[0] , header[1] ); //TODO: check for bad header}//if contentlength > 0//      read bodySo my question is, how can I be sure that I'm reading the body data (if any) starting from the correct position in the inputstream?I don't exactly use streams a lot so I don't really have a feel for them and google hasn't been helpful so far\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "The `InputStream.read()` method reads a single byte of data from the input stream and returns that byte. To read a sequence of bytes, you can use the `InputStream.read(byte[], int, int)` method, which takes a byte array, an offset, and a length as parameters. The offset specifies the starting position in the byte array to read from, and the length specifies the number of bytes to read.\n\nTo read the body data (if any) starting from the correct position in the input stream, you can use the `InputStream.skip(long)` method, which skips over a specified number of bytes in the input stream. You can use this method to skip over any header data that you have already read, and then read the body data starting from the next position in the input stream.\n\nHere is an example of how you can modify your code to read the body data starting from the correct position in the input stream:\n```\nInputStream stream = socket.getInputStream();\nHashMap<String, String> headers = new HashMap<String, String>();\nbyte [] buffer = new byte[8*1024];\nstream.read( buffer , 0 , 8*1024);\nByteArrayInputStream bytestream = new ByteArrayInputStream( buffer );\nInputStreamReader streamReader = new InputStreamReader( bytestream );\nBufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader( streamReader );\nString requestline = reader.readLine();\nfor ( ;; ){\n    String line = reader.readLine();\n    if ( line.equals( \"\" ) )\n        break;\n    String[] header = line.split( \":\" , 2 );\n    headers.put( header[0] , header[1] ); //TODO: check for bad header\n    //if contentlength > 0\n    //    read body\n    // read the next line of the input stream\n    stream.skip(8*1024); // skip over the header data\n    bytestream.reset();\n    streamReader.reset();\n    reader = new BufferedReader( streamReader );\n    requestline = reader.readLine();\n}\n// if there is body data, read it starting from the next position in the input stream\nif ( headers.containsKey( \"Content-Length\" ) && headers.get( \"Content-Length\" ).equals( \"0\" ) ) {\n    int contentLength = Integer.parseInt( headers.get( \"Content-Length\" ) );\n    byte [] body = new byte[contentLength];\n    stream.read( body , 0 , contentLength);\n}\n```\nThis code reads the header data from the input stream, and then skips over the header data using the `InputStream.skip()` method. It then reads the next line of the input stream, and repeats this process until it reaches the end of the input stream. If there is body data, it reads it starting from the next position in the input stream.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."}
