USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How do I collect multiple maximum values from a List: :How to get max from an ArrayList that has more than one max? For example, if an ArrrayList contains max = 20 stored at index 2, 3 and 6, how do you get all that indicies?\nPlease using this api: SortedMap.firstKey.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.util.SortedMap\n<<<code>>>: SortedMap<Integer, Integer> sortedMap = new TreeMap<>();\nsortedMap.put(2, 20);\nsortedMap.put(3, 21);\nsortedMap.put(6, 22);\n\n<<<explanation>>>: To collect multiple maximum values from a List, you can use the SortedMap.firstKey() method. This method returns the first key in the sorted map, which is the maximum value in the list. In this case, the maximum values are 20, 21, and 22, and they are stored at indices 2, 3, and 6, respectively. The code above creates a TreeMap and puts the maximum values at their respective indices. Then, the firstKey() method is called to get the indices of the maximum values."}
