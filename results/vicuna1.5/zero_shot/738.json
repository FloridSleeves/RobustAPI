USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Append .txt file to a TextArea in Java: :I've seen a lot of websites that describe how to append text into a textarea, but is there a way to grab data from a whole .txt file and display it in the textarea?I've been playing around with various things to put into a line like this:outputTextArea.append(????);But no luck yet.Super new to java and not so good with the terminology but I hope I explained my question well.EDIT: It won't let me respond to my own question, so I'm just going to put it up here.I am using JTextArea, but I guess I'm a little overwhelmed. I'm not entirely sure what I'm seeing, but is this what you were talking about?public FileReader(String fileName);I've got this so far.FileWriter fwriter = new FileWriter(\"BigMoneys.txt\", true);PrintWriter outputFile = new PrintWriter(fwriter);for (int year = 1; year<= 10; year++){    amount = principal * Math.pow(1.0 + rate, year);    outputFile.append( year + \"\\t\" + moneyFormat.format(amount) + \"\\n\");}outputFile.close();JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, outputTextArea, \"Compound Interest\", JOptionPane.INFORMATION_MESSAGE);System.exit(0);The rest of this was covered in my textbook fairly well, and all makes decent sense, but I just checked and the book has nothing about FileReader.All I know is I'm supposed to use what's in outputFile and append it to outputTextArea. I'm honestly not trying to get you to do my homework for me, I'm just really really lost.So if I am supposed to use that line above, could I do this?FileReader(String fwriter)EDIT2: This is what I've got so far.

Thanks for everyone's help. Case closed, goodnight :)\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter outputFile = new PrintWriter(fwriter); for (int year = 1; year <= 10; year++) { amount = principal * Math.pow(1.0 + rate, year); outputFile.write( year + \"\\t\" + moneyFormat.format(amount) + \"\\n\"); } outputFile.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: This code uses the PrintWriter.write method to write the contents of the for loop to the file. The method takes a string argument, which is the data to be written to the file. In this case, the string is formatted with the year, amount, and a tab character, and is written to the file with each iteration of the loop. After the loop is finished, the PrintWriter.close method is called to close the file."}
