USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: round robin scheduling java iterators: :I have a list of hosts in an array which represnt the servers available to do a particular job. Currently I simply iterate thru the list looking and establish comms with a host to check its not busy. If not I will send a job to it. This approach tends to mean that the first host in the list tends to get hot constanly with the load not balanced properly with the rest of the available hosts.in pseudocode ..for (Host h : hosts) {    //checkstatus    if status == job accepted break;}I'd like to balance this load properly between the hosts i.e first time host one is used 2nd time the method is used host 2. Just wondering that the most elegant solution to this is ??ThanksW\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: Iterator.next()\n<<<explanation>>>: Using the Iterator.next() method, you can retrieve the next element in the iterator without removing it from the list. This can be useful in round-robin scheduling, where you want to balance the load between multiple hosts. By iterating through the list of hosts and checking their status, you can keep track of which host has been used previously. Then, you can use the Iterator.next() method to select the next available host for the job, ensuring that the load is balanced properly. For example:\n```vbnet\nIterator<Host> iterator = hosts.iterator();\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\n    Host host = iterator.next();\n    if (host.getStatus() == HostStatus.AVAILABLE) {\n        // send job to host\n        break;\n    }\n}\n```\nThis way, you can ensure that the load is balanced properly between the available hosts, and the first host in the list will not be overloaded."}
