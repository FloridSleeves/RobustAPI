The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: It's showing java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 2: :StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(bo.readLine());int k = 0;while (st.hasMoreTokens()) {    a[k++] = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());}//This line is giving exception.for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {          int temp = a[j];   int temp1 = a[j + 1];   int num = temp + temp1;I want output for this line.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(bo.readLine());\nwhile (st.hasMoreTokens()) {\nint num = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: This code reads a line of text from a file and uses the StringTokenizer class to split the line into individual tokens. It then uses a while loop to iterate through the tokens and parse them as integers. The code then calculates the sum of two consecutive tokens and assigns it to a variable called \"num\". However, the code is giving an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException on the line \"int num = temp + temp1;\". This is because the index used to access the elements of the \"a\" array is out of bounds. To fix this, the code should use a for loop to iterate through the tokens and store them in an array, rather than using a while loop."}
