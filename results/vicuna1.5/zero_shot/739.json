First, create a PrintWriter object and specify the path to the file you want to append to. Then, use the write() method to add new text to the file. Remember to include a newline character at the end of each append to ensure that the text is properly formatted. Finally, close the PrintWriter to ensure that all changes are saved to the file."}
