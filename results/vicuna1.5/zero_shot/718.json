USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Does a PrintWriter / PrintStream need to be flushed?: :I'd like to use a PrintWriter or PrintStream to write formatted strings out to an outputstream (for which I have no control over the creation).  However flushing the underlying OutputStream has a big performance hit.Does a PrintWriter / PrintStream need to be flushed.If I need to flush the PrintStream / PrintWriter; can I do so without flushing the underlying OutputStream, or will I need to create a \"flush protecter\" OutputStream to wrap the underlying stream?To try to be a little clearer on this I want to implement public void writeSomeString(OutputStream foo);But this method may be called many times for the same OutputStream (foo).  Each call will have to construct its own PrintWriter.  I know it's ugly to do so but I have no control over the interface or the creation of foo.I'm trying to avoid each method having to flush foo just to flush its own PrintWriter / PrintStream.So I want to:public void writeSomeString(OutputStream foo) {    PrintStream s = new PrintStream(foo);    s.println(\"bar\");    // other code}I want to completely avoid this method flushing foo \nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.io.PrintWriter\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter.write(String)\n<<<explanation>>>: The `PrintWriter.write` method writes a string to the underlying output stream without flushing it. So, you can use this method to write to the output stream without flushing it. However, if you want to flush the output stream, you can use the `PrintWriter.flush` method.\n\nRegarding your question about flushing the underlying output stream, it depends on how you are using the `PrintWriter` instance. If you are not explicitly flushing the `PrintWriter` instance, then the underlying output stream will be flushed automatically when the `PrintWriter` instance is closed. So, you may not need to flush the underlying output stream manually. However, if you are flushing the `PrintWriter` instance explicitly, then you will need to flush the underlying output stream manually using the `flush` method.\n\nIn your case, since you want to avoid flushing the underlying output stream, you can use the `PrintWriter.write` method to write to the output stream without flushing it. If you need to flush the output stream, you can use the `PrintWriter.flush` method."}
