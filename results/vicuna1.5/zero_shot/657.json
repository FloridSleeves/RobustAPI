How can I do it?\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.util.Map\n<<<code>>>: list.stream().collect(Collectors.groupingBy(ArrayList::get)).entrySet().stream().map(e -> e.getValue()).collect(Collectors.toSet());\n<<<explanation>>>: This code uses the `java.util.Map` API to group the elements of the `ArrayList` by the `get()` method, which returns the element at a specific index. The `Collectors.groupingBy()` method is then used to group the elements by the index, and the `Collectors.toSet()` method is used to convert the result to a set, which will count the number of occurrences of each element in the `ArrayList`."}
