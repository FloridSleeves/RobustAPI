USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Remove List<String> duplicates using equals: :I'm fairly new to Java and I've been trying to solve the following problem unsuccessfully. Write a Java method that will remove duplicates from a given list. Assuming:Method accepts type ListReturn type is voidDuplicates are determined using equals()Main:Creates an instant of List and loads it with duplicate String valuesInvoke removeDuplicates(), pass in this listOutputs modified list to the console.I can solve the problem by passing in my list to a new HashSet and copy it back. But the problem is:Question is asking me to solve it using equals()... If the return type is void, how can i output it in the main ?import java.util.*;    public class Question1 {    public static void main(String[] args) {String[] words = {\"good\",\"better\", \"best\", \"best\", \"first\" , \"last\", \"last\", \"last\", \"good\"};          List<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();          for (String s : words) {              list.add(s);          }          removeDuplicates(list);    }    static void removeDuplicates(List<String> array){        HashSet<String> hs = new HashSet<>();        hs.addAll(array);        array.clear();        array.addAll(hs);        for (String x : array){             System.out.println(x);        }    }}EDIT: well, this one works, but as you can see i'm not using equals() and i'm printing out from my static method, not from main. Also, is there any way I can populate the List faster than using String[] ?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "Iterator.next() returns the next element in the iterator. In the context of a for-each loop, it is equivalent to using the traditional for loop syntax with a pre-increment operator.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use Iterator.next() to populate a List faster than using String[]:\n```css\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class Question1 {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();\n        for (String word : Iterator.next(Arrays.asList(\"good\", \"better\", \"best\", \"first\", \"last\"))) {\n            list.add(word);\n        }\n        System.out.println(list);\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, we use Iterator.next() to iterate over the elements in the Arrays.asList(\"good\", \"better\", \"best\", \"first\", \"last\") and add each element to the List<String> list. The resulting list is then printed to the console."}
