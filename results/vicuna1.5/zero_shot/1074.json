The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Reading Email Addresses as Tokens: :How can I read an email address as a token?I saw that the tokenizer method has a limit of 16 bits of length, well my token is like this:command emailtest@somewhere.com 50I want to be able to store the email (can be any email address) and the number (can vary from 5-1500).  I dont care about the command token.My code looks like this:String test2 = command.substring(7);StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(test2);String email = st.nextToken();String amount = st.nextToken();\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String test2 = command.substring(7);StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(test2);String email = st.nextToken();String amount = st.nextToken();\n<<<explanation>>>: This code reads an email address as a token by using the StringTokenizer class. The email address is extracted by calling the nextToken() method of the StringTokenizer object, which returns the next token in the input string. The tokenizer is initialized with the input string using the substring() method, and the email and amount tokens are stored in the email and amount variables, respectively. The limit of 16 bits for the tokenizer is not an issue in this case because the email address is longer than 16 bits."}
