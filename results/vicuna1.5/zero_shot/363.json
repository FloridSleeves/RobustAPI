USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to have List Iterator start at a given index?: :I have a linked list and I need to make method that returns an iterator at a given point in the list. I currently have an iterator that starts at the head:public Iterator<E> iterator( ){    return new ListIterator();}All I have for the other one is:public Iterator<E> iterator(int x ){    return new ListIterator();}I'm not sure how to go about utilizing the given position(x) that won't affect my ListIterator constructor which starts at head. I tried using a for loop to get to \"x\" but realized that wouldn't tell the iterator to start there, so I'm quite stumped. Edit:public ListIterator()        {            current = head; // head in the enclosing list        }\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: Iterator iterator = myList.iterator();\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\nint x = iterator.next();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: To have the List Iterator start at a given index, you can use a while loop and the Iterator.next() method. First, create an Iterator object for the linked list using the iterator() method. Then, use a while loop to iterate through the list until you reach the desired index. Inside the loop, call the Iterator.next() method to move to the next element in the list. Finally, you can access the value of the element at the desired index by using the x variable."}
