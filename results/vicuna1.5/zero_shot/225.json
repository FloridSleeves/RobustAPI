USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to run a mvn command from a java program?: :I am building a Java program for automating a procedure in my server side. Normally I cd to Desktop/GIT/ and use this maven command \"mvn integration-test -DskipTests -P interactive -e\".I am building a java program and I am trying to run that command line but so far I wasn't successful. So far, here is the code:public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException {// TODO Auto-generated method stub Process theProcess = null;try  {      theProcess = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(\"mvn integration-test -DskipTests -P interactive -e\");  } catch(IOException e)  {     System.err.println(\"Error on exec() method\");     e.printStackTrace();    }// read from the called program's standard output stream  try  {     inStream = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader( theProcess.getInputStream()));       System.out.println(inStream.readLine());  }  catch(IOException e)  {     System.err.println(\"Error on inStream.readLine()\");     e.printStackTrace();    }break;    }}in.close();}\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.io.InputStream.read()\n<<<code>>>: inStream.readLine()\n<<<explanation>>>: The code is trying to read a line from the standard output stream of the process created by executing the \"mvn integration-test\" command. The InputStream.read() method is used to read a single character from the input stream. However, it is not reading the entire line, and the program is failing with an IOException. To read the entire line, the InputStream.readLine() method should be used."}
