USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Get random value from a HashMap<String, HashSet<Integer>>: :I have a function that accepts a HashMap<String, HashSet<Integer>>. Now I want to get a random value from the HashMap but I don't know how to do this. Could you give me a hint?The output should consist of a tuple containing the String and an Integer value.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: map.iterator().next().toString()\n<<<explanation>>>: This code uses the Iterator.next() method to get the next key-value pair from the HashMap's iterator. The key is then converted to a String using the toString() method, and the Integer value is obtained using the Integer.parseInt() method. Finally, the tuple (key, value) is returned."}
