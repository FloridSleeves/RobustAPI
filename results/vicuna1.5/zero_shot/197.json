It takes one parameter, an integer buffer, which represents the byte to be read. The method returns the actual number of bytes read, or -1 if the end of the stream has been reached.\n\nExample:\n```java\nInputStream in = new FileInputStream(\"example.txt\");\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\nint bytesRead = in.read(buffer);\nif (bytesRead > 0) {\n    // Read data\n} else {\n    // End of stream reached\n}\n```"}
