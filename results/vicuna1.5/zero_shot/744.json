USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: PrintWriter not appending content in the right order: :I have a list that contains objects (whose constructor contains another inner object). When I'm trying to print the list to a file, I go through each object and call the object's respective writer methods.public void writer(String file, boolean append) {    File path = new File(\"../Opdracht6_2/src/\" + file);    try {        PrintWriter write = new PrintWriter(new FileOutputStream(path,                append));        for (SuperObject o : this.list) {            if (o instanceof Object1) {                ((subObject1) w).writer1(file);            }            if (o instanceof Object2) {                ((subObject3) w).writer2(file);                            }if (o instanceof Object3) {                ((subObject3) w).writer3(file);                            }        }        write.close();    } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {        // TODO Auto-generated catch block        e.printStackTrace();    }}In the object's writer method I try to first print a line which says what type it is and then call the writer method for the innerobject. After that I want current object's arguments to be printed and than it goes back to the lists writer methodpublic void writer1(String file) {    File path = new File(\"../Opdracht6_2/src/\" + file);    try {        PrintWriter write = new PrintWriter(                new FileOutputStream(path, true));        //below is the string I want to print before the innerobject appends         //its own arguments to the file        write.append(\"String\\r\\n\");        this.innerobject.innerwriter();        write.append(this objects arg);        write.close();    } catch (IOException e) {        // TODO Auto-generated catch block        e.printStackTrace();    }}The innerobject's writerpublic void innerwriter(String file) {    File path = new File(\"../Opdracht6_2/src/\" + file);    try {        PrintWriter write = new PrintWriter(                new FileOutputStream(path, true));        write.append(this objects arg);        write.close();    } catch (IOException e) {        // TODO Auto-generated catch block        e.printStackTrace();    }}Now the thing that is actually happening is that the line that I'm trying to append first gets appended after the innerobject's arguments even though I have put it before the method that calls the innerobject's writer.It looks like this then in the file:inner objects argstringouter objects argCan someone explain why?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: write.append(this.objects.arg);\n<<<explanation>>>: The issue with the code is that the line \"write.append(\"String\\r\\n\");\" is being appended after the innerobject's arguments, because the innerobject's writer method is being called before the outerobject's writer method. The reason for this is that the innerobject's writer method is being called recursively, and the call to write.append(\"String\\r\\n\"); is being made after the innerobject's arguments have been appended. To fix this, you can move the call to write.append(\"String\\r\\n\"); before the call to the innerobject's writer method, like this:\nwrite.append(\"String\\r\\n\");\nthis.innerobject.innerwriter(file);\nwrite.append(this.objects.arg);\nwrite.close();"}
