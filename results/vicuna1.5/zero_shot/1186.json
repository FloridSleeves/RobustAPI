Closed 10 years ago.I have a set of 3 strings, each in different lines, which are integers separated by spaces.1 1 23 4 44 5 5I wanted to input them into a character array, and I used StringTokenizer in this manner:for(int j=0;i<n1;i++){  s2=bure.readLine();           st1=new StringTokenizer(s2);  for(int k=0;k<n2;k++){    a[j][k]=Integer.parseInt(st1.nextToken());  }      }Where n1 and n2 are the number of rows and columns.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.util.StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: StringTokenizer st1 = new StringTokenizer(s2);\nfor(int k=0;k<n2;k++){\na[j][k]=Integer.parseInt(st1.nextToken());\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: This code uses the StringTokenizer class to tokenize the input string s2 into individual tokens. The nextToken method is then used to retrieve the next token in the sequence, which is an integer. This integer is then parsed into an integer variable and assigned to the corresponding element in the two-dimensional array a[j][k]. This process is repeated for each iteration of the outer for loop, where j and k represent the row and column indices respectively."}
