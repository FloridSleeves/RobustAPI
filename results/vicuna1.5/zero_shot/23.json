This method sets the layout for the activity to be displayed on the screen. You can create a `LinearLayout` or `GridLayout` to act as the matrix and set the size of the matrix using the `android:layout_width` and `android:layout_height` attributes. Then, you can allow the user to enter values inside the matrix by adding `EditText` views for each cell and binding them to the matrix layout."}
