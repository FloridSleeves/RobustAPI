{"api": "RandomAccessFile.write", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to append to AES encrypted file: :I'm writing some kind of logger that produces encrypted log-file. Unfortunately, cryptography is not my strong side. Now I can write to file several messages and then close file. Then i can open it, append some messages, close again and after decryption I see padding bytes in the middle of file. Is there any way to work with encrypted file without having to decrypt it every time I want to append some messages?EDIT: little more details. Current implementation utlizes CipherOutputStream. As i understand there's no way to seek using it.Can i use 'NoPadding' option if i will control that output data size is divisible by block size?\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: RandomAccessFile.write\n<<<code>>>: file.seek(file.length() - 10); // set position to the end of the file\nfile.write(\"new message\".getBytes()); // write new message to the file\nfile.write(\"more message\".getBytes()); // write more message to the file\nfile.close();\n\n<<<explanation>>>: Yes, you can use the 'NoPadding' option if you control that the output data size is divisible by the block size. However, using the 'NoPadding' option may result in padding bytes at the end of the file, which can cause issues when reading the file. To avoid this, you can use the 'NoPadding' option and write the data in blocks, ensuring that the data size is divisible by the block size. In the example above, we have set the position of the file to the end using the 'seek' method and then written the new data to the file. After writing the new data, we have closed the file."}
