USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to cut Java for each loop in half?: :I'm working a lot with for each loops in Java. I'm using them to make every class of my objects to do \"drawing\", but it takes a lot of memory so I want to cut it in half, is there a way to do for each loop not for a full list?for(Tile tile: tiles){tile.draw();}I want to:for(Tile tile: (half of)tiles){    tile.draw();}is it possible or I just need to get lenght of tiles and when it reaches the number break the loop?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next()\n<<<code>>>: Iterator iterator = tiles.iterator();while (iterator.hasNext()) {Tile tile = iterator.next();tile.draw();}\n<<<explanation>>>: By using the Iterator.next() method, you can iterate over a subset of the elements in the collection, rather than the entire collection. In your case, you can create an iterator for the tiles collection and use the hasNext() method to check if there are more elements to iterate over. Once you have iterated over half of the elements, you can use the break statement to exit the loop. This way, you can cut the for each loop in half and reduce the memory usage."}
