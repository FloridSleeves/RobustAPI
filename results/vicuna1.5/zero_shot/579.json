Improve this question                    I have stored some JSON objects in MongoDB collections and using Mongo jar and Java I did full text search, and I am extracting one of my DB fields using below code:String tags2=dbo.getString(\"Tags\");Result:[[\"pdf\",\"java\",\"c++\"][\"perl\",\"pdf\",\"c\"][\"java\",\"c++\"]]My requirement is to split all the words and remove duplicates. I require the following output:pdfjavac++cperlCan you please suggest a way to get this?\nPlease using this api: JsonElement.getAsString.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: JsonElement.getAsString\n<<<code>>>: tags2 = dbo.getString(\"Tags\");\nString[] tags = tags2.getAsString().split(\"\\\\s+\");\nArrays.sort(tags);\nArrays.sort(tags);\nSet<String> uniqueTags = new HashSet<String>(tags);\nString[] uniqueTagsArray = uniqueTags.toArray(new String[0]);\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The above code first extracts the \"Tags\" field from the MongoDB collection using the \"dbo.getString\" method. It then uses the \"split\" method to split the string into an array of words, and removes any duplicates using a HashSet. Finally, it converts the set back to an array and returns the unique tags."}
