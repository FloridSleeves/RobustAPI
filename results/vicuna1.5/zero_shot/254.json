{"api": "InputStream.read", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java copy part of InputStream to OutputStream: :I have a file with 3236000 bytes and I want to read 2936000 from start and write to an OutputStreamInputStream is = new FileInputStream(file1);OutputStream os = new FileOutputStream(file2);AFunctionToCopy(is,os,0,2936000); /* a function or sourcecode to write input stream 0to2936000 bytes */I can read and write byte by byte, but it's to slow (i think) from buffered readingHow can do I copy it?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.io.InputStream.read()\n<<<code>>>: is.read(os.toByteArray(), 0, 2936000);\n<<<explanation>>>: This code uses the InputStream.read() method to read the contents of the input stream is into the output stream os. The first argument to the read() method is the byte array that will hold the read data, the second argument is the number of bytes to read, and the third argument is the position in the input stream from which to start reading. In this case, the code reads 2936000 bytes from the start of the input stream is and writes it to the output stream os."}
