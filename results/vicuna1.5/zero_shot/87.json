USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Transferring byte[] over sockets: :I have a byte array that has to be sent to the server.byte[] b=new byte[]{(byte)0xFE,0x01,0x01,0x32,0x00,0x00,(byte)0xFD};My client code for sending isPrintStream pw=new PrintStream(s.getOuputStream());pw.Println(b);My server code for receiving is InputStreamReader in=new InputStreamreader();BufferedReader br=new BufferedReader(in);String s=br.readline();System.out.println(\"client sent :\" + s);when server receives and prints the output i am getting the output as client sent:[B@1f4917a7I want the output same as what is sent: FE 01 01 32 00 00 FD\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.io.DataOutputStream\n<<<code>>>: DataOutputStream out = new DataOutputStream(s.getOutputStream());\nout.write(b);\n<<<explanation>>>: By using the DataOutputStream.write() method, you can write the byte array b to the output stream s. This will ensure that the bytes are sent to the server in the same order as they were originally stored in the byte array."}
