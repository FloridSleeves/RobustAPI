{"api": "Map.get", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Bug casting String, Integer, Double using HashMap: :I have some strange bug on Android 2.3 and lower.I have following code:HashMap<Somekey, Object> data = new HashMap<Somekey, Object>();data.put(somekey, \"asdfdsafdsf\");String value = (String) data.get(somekey);on the last line I have ClassCastException: get(somekey) returns Boolean value instead of String. This error appears not only with String type, with Integer and Double too.I don't understand why, because this code correctly works on android 4.0.3 and higher.\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.util.Map.get()\n<<<code>>>: data.get(somekey)\n<<<explanation>>>: The issue with the code is that the `get()` method of a `Map` returns an `Object`, not a `String`, `Integer`, or `Double`. Therefore, when you try to cast the return value to a `String`, `Integer`, or `Double`, you get a `ClassCastException`. To fix the issue, you can use the `valueOf()` method of the `Map` to get the value as a `String`, `Integer`, or `Double`, depending on the type of the key. For example, to get the value as a `String`, you can use the following code:\n```\nString value = data.get(somekey).toString();\n```\nThis will call the `toString()` method of the `Object` returned by the `get()` method, which will convert it to a `String`. Similarly, you can use the `valueOf()` method of the `Map` to get the value as an `Integer` or `Double`."}
