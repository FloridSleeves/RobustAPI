USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Code isn't working: :This is my first question here. I've searched for my doubt. I found similar questions but i haven't exactly got my answer. So please forgive me if i have done something wrong.I'm trying to save an image from an ImageView in my app to a folder in my sdcard. Here's the code :-public void save(View view) {    myImage.setDrawingCacheEnabled(true);    Bitmap imgV = myImage.getDrawingCache();    String root = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().toString();    File myDir = new File(root + \"/AVP_saved\");    String fname=\"Image.png\";    File file = new File(myDir, fname);        try {               FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(file);               imgV.compress(Bitmap.CompressFormat.PNG, 90, out);               out.flush();               out.close();               Toast.makeText(this, \"Image Downloaded\", 7000).show();        } catch (Exception e) {               e.printStackTrace();               Toast.makeText(this, e.getMessage(), 8000).show();        }    }'save' method is the method assigned to a button. 'myImage' is the ImageView found by its id. I have already set the permissions in the manifest. The thing is, the image dosen't get saved and it says that the path dosen't exist. When I myself create the folder \"AVP_saved\", then the image gets saved. What do i have to edit in this code such that the app creates the folder by itself when i click the button?Thanks for your time!\nPlease using this api: File.mkdirs.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: File.mkdirs\n<<<code>>>: File.mkdirs(myDir)\n<<<explanation>>>: This code will create the folder \"AVP\\_saved\" in the root directory of the SD card if it doesn't already exist. The File.mkdirs() method creates a directory with the given name, and if the directory does not exist, it will be created automatically. So, you don't need to worry about creating the folder manually. Just call the File.mkdirs() method before saving the image, and it will create the folder automatically."}
