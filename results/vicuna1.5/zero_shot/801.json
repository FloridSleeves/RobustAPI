USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: what is the efficent way to process larges text files?: :I have two files:1- with 1400000 line or record --- 14 MB2- with 16000000 -- 170 MBI want to find if each record or line in file 1 is also in file 2 or notI develop a java app that do the following: Read file line by line and pass each line to a method that loop in file 2 Here is my code:  public boolean hasIDin(String bioid) throws Exception {    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"C://AllIDs.txt\"));    long bid = Long.parseLong(bioid);    String thisLine;    while((thisLine = br.readLine( )) != null)    {         if (Long.parseLong(thisLine) == bid)            return true;    }        return false;    }public void getMBD() throws Exception{     BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"C://DIDs.txt\"));     OutputStream os = new FileOutputStream(\"C://MBD.txt\");     PrintWriter pr = new PrintWriter(os);     String thisLine;     int count=1;     while ((thisLine = br.readLine( )) != null){         String bioid = thisLine;         System.out.println(count);         if(! hasIDin(bioid))                pr.println(bioid);     count++;     }    pr.close();}  When I run it seems it will take more 1944.44444444444 hours to complete as every line processing takes 5 sec. That is about three months!Is there any ideas to make it done in a much much more less time.Thanks in advance.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: os.write(bioid + \"\\n\");\n<<<explanation>>>: Instead of using the BufferedReader.readLine() method to read each line of the file, you can use the PrintWriter.write() method to write each line directly to the output file. This will eliminate the need for the loop and the call to the hasIDin() method for each line, significantly reducing the time required to process the file."}
