When the user activates the search box, then I have it set up so that this method should be returning a cursor with the suspected items based on their name. Through debugging, I deduced that the problem was with the method of search inside my Content Provider. Any solutions or thoughts?\nPlease using this api: SQLiteDatabase.query.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: SQLiteDatabase.query\n<<<code>>>: dbHelper.getReadableDatabase().query(FORMULA_TABLE_NAME, new String[] { BaseColumns._ID, SearchManager.SUGGEST_COLUMN_TEXT_1, BaseColumns._ID + \" AS \" + SearchManager.SUGGEST_COLUMN_INTENT_DATA_ID }, Formula.FORMULA_NAME + \" LIKE %?%\", new String[] { query + \"*\" }, null, null, null);\n<<<explanation>>>: The issue with the current implementation is that the query is not returning any results because the selection criteria is not correct. The current selection criteria is searching for the entire query string in the Formula.FORMULA\\_NAME column, which will never match any rows in the table. Instead, the selection criteria should be searching for the partial match of the query string in the Formula.FORMULA\\_NAME column. The modified code above uses the LIKE operator with a wildcard character at the end of the query string to match any partial match of the query string in the Formula.FORMULA\\_NAME column."}
