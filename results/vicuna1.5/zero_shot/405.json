I'm trying to make it so that these buttons are randomly called by the program. So far, I just have these for 12 buttons that just change the text when pressed by the user. Now I need a way of making it so that they are randomly pressed the program itself and not the user. Any idea's on how this is done in java?// **** Panels for buttons ****        JPanel panelButtons = new JPanel();                         // making the panel for the buttons        panelButtons.setLayout(new GridLayout(3, 4));               // setting the layout of the buttons to 3x4 as shown above        b1 = new JButton(\" \u20dd\");                                     // creating button and setting its default text        b1.setFont(fontText);                                       // setting the font        b1.addActionListener(new ActionListener(){                  // action listener to do something when pressed            public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {                    sendMessage(user + \"1\" );                       // sends the name of the user that pressed the button and which button                    String field1 = b1.getText();                   // gets the text from the button and stores it in a String                    if(field1 == \" \u20dd\"){                             // checks if the string is equal to an empty circle                        b1.setText(\"\u2b24\");                            // if true then change to a full circle                    }                    else if (field1 == \"\u2b24\"){                        // opposite of the above if statement                        b1.setText(\" \u20dd\");                    }               }        });         panelButtons.add(b1);                                       // adding the button to the panel        b2 = new JButton(\" \u20dd\");                                     // creating button and setting its default text        b2.setFont(fontText);                                       // setting the font        b2.addActionListener(new ActionListener(){                  // action listener to do something when pressed            public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {                                sendMessage(user + \"2\" );                       // sends the name of the user that pressed the button and which button                    String field2 = b2.getText();                   // gets the text from the button and stores it in a String                    if(field2 == \" \u20dd\"){                             // checks if the string is equal to an empty circle                        b2.setText(\"\u2b24\");                            // if true then change to a full circle                    }                    else if (field2 == \"\u2b24\"){                        // opposite of the above if statement                        b2.setText(\" \u20dd\");                    }               }        });        panelButtons.add(b2);                                       // adding the button to the panel\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next()\n<<<code>>>: Iterator.next()\n<<<explanation>>>: The Iterator.next() method is used to retrieve the next element in an iterator.
