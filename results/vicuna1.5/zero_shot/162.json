USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to Cache InputStream for Multiple Use: :I have an InputStream of a file and i use apache poi components to read from it like this:POIFSFileSystem fileSystem = new POIFSFileSystem(inputStream);The problem is that i need to use the same stream multiple times and the POIFSFileSystem closes the stream after use.What is the best way to cache the data from the input stream and then serve more input streams to different POIFSFileSystem ?EDIT 1:By cache i meant store for later use, not as a way to speedup the application. Also is it better to just read up the input stream into an array or string and then create input streams for each use ?EDIT 2:Sorry to reopen the question, but the conditions are somewhat different when working inside desktop and web application. First of all, the InputStream i get from the org.apache.commons.fileupload.FileItem in my tomcat web app doesn't support markings thus cannot reset. Second, I'd like to be able to keep the file in memory for faster acces and less io problems when dealing with files.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "To cache the InputStream for multiple use, you can use the following approach:\n\n1. Create a new FileOutputStream and write the contents of the InputStream to it.\n2. Close the FileOutputStream.\n3. Open the FileOutputStream again and use it to create a new POIFSFileSystem.\n4. Use the new POIFSFileSystem to read the file contents.\n\nHere's the code:\n```java\nInputStream inputStream = ...; // get the InputStream\nFileOutputStream outputStream = null;\n\ntry {\n    outputStream = new FileOutputStream(\"cache.tmp\"); // create a file to cache the InputStream\n    byte[] buffer = new byte[1024]; // create a buffer to read the InputStream\n    int read; // variable to store the number of bytes read\n\n    while ((read = inputStream.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n        outputStream.write(buffer, 0, read); // write the contents of the buffer to the FileOutputStream\n    }\n\n    outputStream.close(); // close the FileOutputStream\n    POIFSFileSystem fileSystem = new POIFSFileSystem(new File(\"cache.tmp\")); // open the FileOutputStream to create a new POIFSFileSystem\n    // use the fileSystem to read the file contents\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n} finally {\n    if (outputStream != null) {\n        try {\n            outputStream.close();\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code creates a FileOutputStream and writes the contents of the InputStream to it. After closing the FileOutputStream, it opens it again and uses it to create a new POIFSFileSystem. This way, you can reuse the FileOutputStream to create multiple POIFSFileSystems without closing the InputStream.\n\nNote that this approach may not be suitable for web applications, as it requires the file to be stored in the file system. In that case, you can use a different approach, such as reading the InputStream into a byte array or string and creating InputStreams from that data."}
