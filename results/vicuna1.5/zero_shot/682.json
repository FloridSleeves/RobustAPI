To avoid this, you can use the PrintWriter class, which does not close the file after writing to it. Instead, you can use the flush() method to ensure that the data is written to the file.\n\nHere's the modified code:\n```java\npublic static void writeToLog(Context context, String string) {\n    String text = getTimestamp() + \" \" + string;\n    PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(logFile, true)));\n    out.println(text);\n    out.flush();\n    out.close();\n}\n```\nThis should prevent the log file from being overwritten and ensure that all data is saved to the file."}
