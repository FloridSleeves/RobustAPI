The book is a bit outdated (no generic types ), so I'm trying to rewrite some of it. I'm supposed to write Wrapper on Iterator to work like Enumerator methods and test it with ArrayList.The \"original\" version looked like this(below). I've tried to make it generic class such as <E> or even <T<E>>, but it didn't work. I want to be also sure that it will work for any kind of iterator, not only ArrayList like ArrayList<T>. What is the proper way to implement this ?public class IteratorWrapper implements Enumeration {    Iterator iterator;    public IteratorWrapper(Iterator iterator){        this.iterator = iterator;    }    public boolean hasMoreElements(){        return iterator.hasNext();    }    //Return generic Type T     public Object nextElement(){        return iterator.next();    }}Test classpublic class WrapperTest {    public static void main(String[] args){        ArrayList<String> arrayList = new ArrayList<String>();        arrayList.add(\"element1\");        arrayList.add(\"element2\");        //This part will be rewritten when wrapper will work          IteratorWrapper iteratorWrapper = new IteratorWrapper(arrayList.iterator());        while(iteratorWrapper.hasMoreElements()){            System.out.println(iteratorWrapper.nextElement());        }    }}\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "The proper way to implement a generic IteratorWrapper class that works for any kind of iterator, not only ArrayList, is to use the Iterator interface and its methods, including the next() method. You can create a wrapper class that implements the Iterator interface and overrides the hasNext() and next() methods. To make the class generic, you can use the <E> wildcard to indicate that the class can work with any type of element.\n\nHere's an example implementation:\n\n<<<api>>>: Iterator.next()\n<<<code>>>: public class GenericIteratorWrapper implements Iterator<E> {\n<<<explanation>>>: This class implements the Iterator interface and overrides the hasNext() and next() methods.
