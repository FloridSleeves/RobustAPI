USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to wrap a java.util.Iterator to change the type of object being iterated: :I am providing some facade classes for a third-party API and I need to wrap an iterator so that I can replace what is iterated with my own facade object.Here's a simplified version of my facade class that wraps an API class called Itemclass FacadeItem {    Item item;    FacadeItem(Item item) {        this.item = item;    }}The API provides an iterator of this form Iterator<Item>I need to implement an iterator of this form Iterator<FacadeItem> that is backed by the iterator of the API.I considered using the ForwardingIterator from the Guava library as follows:class FacadeItemIterator<FacadeItem> extends ForwardingIterator<Item> {    final Iterator<Item> delegate; // backing iterator    FacadeItemIterator(Iterator<Item> delegate) {        this.delegate = delegate;    }    @Override protected Iterator<Item> delegate() {        return delegate;    }    @Override    public FacadeItem next() {        return new FacadeItem(super.next());    }}but the Override of next() is not permitted by the compiler because it is expecting the returned type to be Item, not FacadeItem\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "To wrap an iterator of type `Iterator<Item>` to return an iterator of type `Iterator<FacadeItem>`, you can use the `Iterator.next()` method to retrieve the next element from the underlying iterator and return it as a `FacadeItem`. Here's an example implementation:\n\n<<<api>>>: java.util.Iterator.next()\n<<<code>>>:\nclass FacadeItemIterator<FacadeItem> extends ForwardingIterator<Item> {\nfinal Iterator<Item> delegate; // backing iterator\nFacadeItemIterator(Iterator<Item> delegate) {\nthis.delegate = delegate;\n}\n@Override\nprotected Iterator<Item> delegate() {\nreturn delegate;\n}\n@Override\npublic FacadeItem next() {\nFacadeItem nextItem = new FacadeItem(delegate.next());\nreturn nextItem;\n}\n}\n\nExplanation:\nThe `Iterator.next()` method returns the next element in the iterator, which in this case is an `Item`. We can create a new `FacadeItem` object by calling `new FacadeItem(delegate.next())` and return it as the result of the `next()` method. This way, the returned iterator will iterate over `FacadeItem` objects instead of `Item` objects."}
