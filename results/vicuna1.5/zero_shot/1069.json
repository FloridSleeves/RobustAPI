{"api": "StringTokenizer.nextToken", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java split String performances: :Here is the current code in my application:String[] ids = str.split(\"/\");When profiling the application, a non-negligeable time is spent string splitting. Also, the split method takes a regular expression, which is superfluous here.What alternative can I use in order to optimize the string splitting? Is StringUtils.split faster?(I would've tried and tested myself but profiling my application takes a lot of time.)\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String[] ids = str.split(\"/\");\n<<<explanation>>>: Instead of using the split method with a regular expression, you can use the StringTokenizer class to split the string. This will optimize the string splitting as it is faster than the split method. Additionally, the StringTokenizer class allows you to specify the delimiter, which can be useful in this case."}
