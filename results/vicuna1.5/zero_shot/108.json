USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Send a message to specific client using sockets: :I have 3 clients connected through server using sockets. Can any one help me in understanding the concept of how can i send the message to client#1 specifically without sending that message to client 2 or client 3 or how can i send the message to client 2 without sending that message to client 1 and client 3.Sorry for my bad English.\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: DataOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>: DataOutputStream.write(clientId)\n<<<explanation>>>: To send a message to a specific client using sockets, you can use the DataOutputStream.write method and pass the client's ID as an argument. This method allows you to write data to a stream, and by passing the client's ID, you can ensure that the message is only sent to that particular client and not to the other two clients that are connected to the server. For example, if you have three clients connected to the server with IDs 1, 2, and 3, you can send a message to client 1 specifically by writing the following code:\nDataOutputStream.write(1)"}
