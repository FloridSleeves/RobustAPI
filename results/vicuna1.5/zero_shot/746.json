USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Unusual outcome while writing to file: :I am having trouble while writing to file using the PrintWriter. Following is my code:String abc = request.getParameter(\"textAreaField\"); //String is \"a b c\" (with spaces)String fileA = dir + \"/A\";PrintWriter fileWriterA = new PrintWriter(new FileOutputStream(fileA,true));fileWriterA.println(abc);fileWriterA.close();The problem I am having here is while writing to the file \"A\" in the directory \"dir\" only \"a\" from String abc will be written and the rest after the space is not written. String abc here in the code is coming from a textarea in html and I have the above code in my servlet. I am not able to understand why it won't write the string with spaces to file. I think it should. I have also checked by printing the String abc and it does print the string \"a b c\" (with spaces). But it won't print that to file. Is there a problem with my code? Any help would be appreciated.Thanks in advance.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter fileWriterA = new PrintWriter(new FileOutputStream(fileA,true));fileWriterA.write(abc);fileWriterA.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The issue with your code is that you are using the `PrintWriter.println()` method to write the string to the file, which adds a newline character at the end of the string. This is causing the rest of the string after the space to be written to a new line in the file, resulting in only \"a\" being written to the file. To fix this, you should use the `PrintWriter.write()` method instead, which writes the string without adding a newline character. This will write the entire string \"a b c\" (with spaces) to the file."}
