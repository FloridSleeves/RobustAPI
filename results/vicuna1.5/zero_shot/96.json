The server will send bytes to the client by calling DataOutputStream's write(bytes[] b), the DataOutputStream is wrapped around client.getOutputStream directly(no Buffer here).   This is a file download functionality And I'm going to support resume, I didn't use any HTTP here, I've implemented my own simple protocol.  I've seen these questions on SO :1-question1.2-C# question.3-FileChannel question.   The first doesn't answer my question, I can't wrap DataOutputStream around ByteArrayOutputStream because the latter can't be wrapped around client.getOutputStream and I don't know how to implement my own write(int i) method(And don't want to use JNI).   the second is C# not java(and it's calling WIN API anyway, I'm a linux user by the way :) ).   The third is talking about FileChannels and HTTP, As I said I'm not using HTTP and I'm using java Socket's API.  So how to get how many bytes were actually written ?PS (EDIT)By resume support I mean I'll give the client the ability to stop download at specific byte and then after a while(minutes,hours,days,whatever) he/she can resume download from where it has left.   \nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "DataOutputStream.write(bytes[] b) method writes the given byte array to the underlying stream. The number of bytes written can be obtained by calling the method DataOutputStream.size() which returns the number of bytes written to the stream. However, this method does not return the number of bytes written to the underlying stream, which is the socket's output stream in your case. To get the number of bytes written to the socket's output stream, you can use the method Socket.getOutputStream().available() which returns the number of bytes that can be written to the output stream."}
