The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Store parts of string in a string array: :I have a string  tajmahal.txt sarjan.pdf noorjahan.exe. I want to store this string in a string array such that ar[0] = tajmahal.txt, ar[1] = sarjan.pdf and ar[2] = noorjahan.exe. How can I do it without using any build functions in java (because I am using j2me which does not support many j2se functions). Any help would be great. Thanks in advance.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(\"tajmahal.txt sarjan.pdf noorjahan.exe\");\nst.nextToken(); // ar[0] = tajmahal.txt\nst.nextToken(); // ar[1] = sarjan.pdf\nst.nextToken(); // ar[2] = noorjahan.exe\n<<<explanation>>>: This code uses the StringTokenizer class to split the given string into an array of tokens. The nextToken() method is used to retrieve the next token from the string, which is then assigned to the corresponding index in the array. This way, the string can be split into an array of tokens without using any built-in functions in Java."}
