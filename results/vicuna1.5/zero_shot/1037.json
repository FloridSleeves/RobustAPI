The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Remove white space from string without using trim method?: :given string is'_home sweet home__' if user enter the mode as 0 then o/p should be 'home sweet home__'if user enter the mode as 1 then o/p should be '_home sweet home'if user enter the mode as 2 then o/p should be 'home sweet home'.Codepublic static void main(String args[]){Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);System.out.println(\"Enter the String\");String str=sc.nextLine();System.out.println(\"Enter the StringMode\");String strMode= sc.nextLine();switch(){}i want to find total number of white spaces in the given string.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String str = \" _home sweet home_ \";\nStringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(str);\nint count = 0;\nwhile (st.hasMoreTokens()) {\ncount++;\n}\nSystem.out.println(\"Total number of white spaces: \" + count);\n\n<<<explanation>>>: This code uses the StringTokenizer class to tokenize the given string into individual words. The nextToken method of the StringTokenizer class is used to get the next token in the string. While looping through the tokens, if the nextToken method returns null, it means that the end of the string has been reached. Therefore, the loop terminates and the total number of white spaces in the string can be calculated by counting the number of times the nextToken method has been called."}
