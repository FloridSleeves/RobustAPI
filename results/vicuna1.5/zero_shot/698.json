USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: PrintWriter throwing FileNotFoundException: :I am writing a code that outputs to a text file using the PrintWriter class. However, when I try to initialize a new PrintWriter it throws a FileNotFound exception.Here are two versions of my code that both don't work, writer is initialized in the global variable as a PrintWriter.File file = new File(fileName);writer = new PrintWriter(fileName);writer.println(\"N: \" + N);writer.println(\"E: \" + E);writer.println(\"D: \" + D);writer.flush();writer.close();~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~writer = new PrintWriter(fileName);writer.println(\"N: \" + N);writer.println(\"E: \" + E);writer.println(\"D: \" + D);writer.flush();writer.close();Here is a list of the imports I'm using, am I possibly missing one?import java.text.DateFormat;import java.text.SimpleDateFormat;import java.math.*;import java.math.BigInteger;import java.util.*;import java.io.*;\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.io.PrintWriter.write()\n<<<code>>>: writer.write(\"N: \" + N);writer.write(\"E: \" + E);writer.write(\"D: \" + D);writer.flush();writer.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The issue with the code is that the PrintWriter instance is being reinitialized in each iteration of the loop, which creates a new instance of the PrintWriter and overwrites the previous instance. Therefore, the previous instance is not closed properly, which leads to the FileNotFoundException. To fix this, you can move the initialization of the PrintWriter instance outside of the loop and close it properly after writing to the file."}
