USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to shuffle a deck of cards using Java (trying to use hashmap, not working)?: :I have a hashmap<Integer, Card> Card is a class. I have initialized the hashmap with keys from 0-51 and the values are array of Card, as followsCard [] card = new Card[52]for (int i=1; i<=13; i++)    for (int j=0; j<4; j++)        card[++index] = new Card( ((i*10)+j) );and I populate the hashmap as follows:for (int i=1; i<=13; i++)    for (int j=0; j<4; j++)        deck.put( ++key, card[++index] );Now, what I want to do is to shuffle the values side of the hashmap, i do not want,for an example, the key[1] corresponds to card[0] and key[1] corresponds to card[1]. I want, for an exampel, the key[1] corresponds to card[38]. I want the values side to be shuffled. I tried the following:Collections.shuffle(card,new Random()); But it seems it accepts only ArrayList and List. \nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.util.Iterator\n<<<code>>>: deck.entrySet().iterator().next().getValue()\n<<<explanation>>>: You can use the iterator to iterate through the entries of the hashmap and get the value of the current entry. To get the value, you can call the next() method on the iterator and it will return the value associated with the key. To shuffle the values, you can use the Collections.shuffle() method, but since it only accepts lists and arrays, you can use the Iterator.next() method to get the value and then use the Collections.shuffle() method on the array of values."}
