{"api": "Iterator.next", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Are unmodifiableMaps fail fast: :Is Map returned from Collections.unmodifiableMap Fail-Fast. In other words does it throw concurrentModificationException while iterating if somebody else modifies the map with a \"modifiable view\" of the map\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "The `Iterator.next()` method returns a non-null value if there are more elements to be returned by the iterator. If the iterator has no more elements, it will throw a `NoSuchElementException`.\n\nIn the case of `Collections.unmodifiableMap(Map<K, V> m)`, the returned `Map` is an unmodifiable view of the given `Map` and does not throw a `ConcurrentModificationException` when iterating over it. Instead, it will throw a `IllegalArgumentException` if the `Map` is modified while the iterator is still running.\n\nSo, to answer your question, `Collections.unmodifiableMap(Map<K, V> m)` does not fail fast using the `Iterator.next()` method."}
