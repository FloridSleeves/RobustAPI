USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to return all properties of a node with their name and their value using Cypher: :I saw here : How can I return all properties for a node using Cypher? that somebody already asked this question, but 1 year ago.So i need to ask it now : is there a way, today, to return all properties of a node using cypher? i need to do it for a translation system where previous developpers have created it as 1 node per language, with contains all of the properties with their name in the desired language. I need to get it for a Java application.Example:node FR contains: \"Salut_01\" : \"Bonjour\"node UK contains: \"Salut_01\" : \"Hello\"etc...\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: MATCH (n:Node) RETURN n.name, n.value;\n<<<explanation>>>: This Cypher query will return the name and value of all nodes in the \"Node\" type, where the name and value are the properties of the node. The \"Iterator.next\" method can be used to iterate through the results and access each node's properties individually."}
