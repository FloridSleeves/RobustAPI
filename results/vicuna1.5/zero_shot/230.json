{"api": "InputStream.read", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Buffered Reader HTTP POST: :Looking for a bit of help, I have currently written a HTTP server. It currently handles GET requests fine. However, whilst using POST the buffered reader seems to hang. When the request is stopped the rest of the input stream is read via the buffered reader. I have found a few things on google. I have tried changing the CRLF and the protocol version from 1.1 to 1.0 (browsers automatically make requests as 1.1) Any ideas or help would be appreciated. Thanks\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read()\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(response.getEntity().getContent()));\nint bytesRead = reader.read();\nwhile (bytesRead != -1) {\n// process the input stream\nbytesRead = reader.read();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: It seems like the issue is with reading the input stream from the POST request. Instead of using the default constructor for the BufferedReader, try using a constructor that takes an InputStreamReader as an argument. This should resolve the issue with the buffered reader hanging. Additionally, make sure to close the BufferedReader and the InputStreamReader once you are done reading from them."}
