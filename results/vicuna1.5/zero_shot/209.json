USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to stream url from .pls file with java?: :I want to stream a radio with Java, my approach is to download the playlist file (.pls), then extract one of the urls given in that same file and finally, stream it with java. However, it seems I cannot find a way to do it.. I tried with JMF, but I get java.io.IOException: Invalid Http response everytime I run the code.Here is what I tried:Player player = Manager.createPlayer(new URL(\"http://50.7.98.106:8398\"));player.start();The .pls file:[playlist]NumberOfEntries=1File1=http://50.7.98.106:8398/In the piece of code above I'm setting the URL by hand, just for testing, but I've sucessfuly done the .pls downloading code and it's working, and from this I make another question, is it a better approach to just simply play the .pls file locally? Can it be done?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "To stream a URL from a .pls file using Java, you can use the Java Media Framework (JMF) to create a player and load the URL into it. Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to do this:\n\n<<<api>>>: java.io.InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: InputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream(\"path/to/playlist.pls\");\nInputStreamReader inputStreamReader = new InputStreamReader(inputStream);\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(inputStreamReader);\nString line;\nwhile ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) {\nString url = line.trim();\nif (url.startsWith(\"http\")) {\nPlayer player = Manager.createPlayer(new URL(url));\nplayer.start();\n}\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: This code reads the .pls file line by line and checks if each line starts with \"http\". If it does, it creates a player using the URL and starts playing it.\n\nRegarding your question about playing the .pls file locally, yes, it is possible to play the .pls file directly in Java using the JMF. Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to do this:\n\n<<<api>>>: java.io.InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: InputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream(\"path/to/playlist.pls\");\nInputStreamReader inputStreamReader = new InputStreamReader(inputStream);\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(inputStreamReader);\nString line;\nwhile ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) {\nString url = line.trim();\nif (url.startsWith(\"http\")) {\nPlayer player = Manager.createPlayer(new URL(url));\nplayer.start();\n}\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: This code reads the .pls file line by line and creates a player using the URL if the line starts with \"http\". It then starts playing the file."}
