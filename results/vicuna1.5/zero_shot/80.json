USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: java pcm to wav: :I have a pcm file, and I want to convert it to a wav file.Is there any suitable api or code for this?\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.io.DataOutputStream\n<<<code>>>: DataOutputStream.write(int[] audioData, int sampleRate)\n<<<explanation>>>: The DataOutputStream.write method can be used to convert a PCM audio file to a WAV file. The method takes in an array of integers representing the audio data and the sample rate as parameters. The audio data is typically stored in a format such as PCM or IMA, and the sample rate determines the number of samples per second. To use this method, you will need to first convert your PCM audio data to an array of integers, and then pass that array along with the sample rate to the DataOutputStream.write method."}
