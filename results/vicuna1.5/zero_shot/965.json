USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: JAVA Md5 returning non-deterministic results: :I have written following function to compute Md5 checksum in Java.class Utils { public static String md5Hash(String input) {        String result = \"\";        try {            System.out.println(\"Input=\" + input);            final MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD5\");            md.reset();            md.update(input.getBytes());            result = md.digest().toString();        } catch (Exception ee) {            System.err.println(\"Error computing MD5 Hash\");        }        return result;    }};Calling Utils.md5Hash(\"abcde\")  multiple times gives different results. My understanding says md5 returns a deterministic and unique checksum for a string. Is that wrong? Else please let me know the bug in my implementation. Thanks\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "The issue with your implementation is that you are using the `toString()` method to convert the `byte[]` digest to a `String`. This method is not guaranteed to return the same result every time, as it is dependent on the default charset used by the system. To fix this, you should use the `getBytes()` method instead, which returns an array of bytes that represents the digest:\n```css\n<<<api>>>: java.lang.String.getBytes()\n<<<code>>>: String.getBytes()\n<<<explanation>>>: The `getBytes()` method returns an array of bytes that represents the characters in the string, which is used to compute the MD5 checksum. Using this method instead of the `toString()` method ensures that the digest is computed and returned in a deterministic and unique way.\n```"}
