I was able to do the random number using the math.rand() but I am trying to make sure that the three numbers do not match. I did a work around using while and if statements, but I was looking to see if there is a one line of command to do this, so that I can put it right under th activity class so that it's public var. and in that area (activity) I can't use while and if statements, I only can in onCreate due to the void or something. Thank you in advance for your help, and will vote for any help or idea that will lead to finding any info about this. \nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Activity.setContentView\n<<<code>>>: Random rand = new Random();\nint min = 1;\nint max = 100;\nint[] excludedNumbers = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};\nint randomNumber = rand.nextInt(max - min + 1) + min;\nwhile (excludedNumbers.contains(randomNumber)) {\nrandomNumber = rand.nextInt(max - min + 1) + min;\n}\npublic int randomNumber;\n<<<explanation>>>: To create a random number between min and max excluding some numbers that fall between min and max in Android Java, you can use the Random class to generate a random integer, and then use a while loop to generate a new random number until it doesn't match one of the excluded numbers. You can store the generated random number in a public variable for use in the activity class."}
