My main function reads off a .txt file filled with employee names, salaries, departments, and positions. My Employee class is just getters and setters. An list of arraylists are made to represent the employees and I'm not sure how I would find the minimum salary of each of the departments. To find the maximum salary I did this in my department class.public class Department {    String dept;    List<Employee> employees;    double minSal;    double maxSal;    public void addEmployee(Employee emp){        maxSal = 0.0;        if (maxSal < emp.getSalary()) {            maxSal = emp.getSalary();        }but I'm not sure how to get the minimum salary. My idea was to get the salary of one of the employees from each department and use that as a starting point for if (minSal > emp.getSalary()) {    minSalary = emp.getSalary();}But I realized I had no idea what to do. Can I get some help with this?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next()\n<<<code>>>: Iterator<Employee> iterator = employees.iterator();\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\nEmployee emp = iterator.next();\nif (minSal > emp.getSalary()) {\nminSalary = emp.getSalary();\n}\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: This code uses an iterator to iterate through the list of employees in each department. The iterator is used to check if the current employee's salary is less than the current minimum salary. If it is, the current employee's salary is stored as the new minimum salary. This process is repeated for each employee in the department until all employees have been checked. This will give you the minimum salary for each department."}
