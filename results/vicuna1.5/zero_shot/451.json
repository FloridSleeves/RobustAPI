USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Why polymorphism does not work as I'd expect in my code?: :I'm quite new to Java and have come accross to a strange behaviour that I can not explain why this happens or where is the mistake in my code.Here's the code:import java.util.ArrayList;import java.util.Arrays;import java.util.Iterator;abstract class Shape {    public abstract void printMe(String no);}final class Circle extends Shape {    @Override    public void printMe(String no){        System.out.println(\"This is Circle no: \" + no);    }}final class Square extends Shape {    @Override    public void printMe(String no) {        System.out.println(\"This is Square no: \" + no);    }}final class Triangle extends Shape {    @Override    public void printMe(String no) {        System.out.println(\"This is Triangle no: \" + no);    }}public class Foo {    private ArrayList<Shape> shapes;    public Foo(){        this.shapes   = new ArrayList<Shape>();        this.shapes.add(new Circle());        this.shapes.add(new Square());        this.shapes.add(new Triangle());    }    public void printShapes(ArrayList<String> numbers){        for(String s:numbers){            Iterator<Shape> iter = this.shapes.iterator();            Shape shape = iter.next();            shape.printMe(s);        }    }    public static void main(String[] args) {        ArrayList<String> numbers = new ArrayList<String>(Arrays.asList(\"1\", \"2\", \"3\"));        Foo foo = new Foo();        foo.printShapes(numbers);    }}The output I'd expect would be:This is Circle no: 1This is Square no: 2This is Triangle no: 3However, the output I get is:This is Circle no: 1This is Circle no: 2This is Circle no: 3What am I doing wrong?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "The issue with the code is that the `Iterator` is being used incorrectly. The `Iterator` is used to iterate through the elements of a collection, but in this case, it is being used to iterate through the elements of the `ArrayList` of `Shape` objects. The `Iterator` should be used to iterate through the elements of the `ArrayList` of `String` objects, which is being passed to the `printShapes` method.\n\nTo fix the code, you should change the `Iterator` to be used on the `numbers` ArrayList, like this:\n```\nIterator<String> iter = numbers.iterator();\nwhile(iter.hasNext()){\n    String s = iter.next();\n    Shape shape = shapes.get(numbers.indexOf(s));\n    shape.printMe(s);\n}\n```\nThis will iterate through the `numbers` ArrayList and use the `indexOf` method to find the index of the corresponding `Shape` object in the `shapes` ArrayList, and then use the `printMe` method on that object.\n\nAlso, you should change the `printShapes` method signature to take an `ArrayList<String>` instead of a `ArrayList<Shape>`, like this:\n```\npublic void printShapes(ArrayList<String> numbers) {\n    for (String s : numbers) {\n        Iterator<Shape> iter = shapes.iterator();\n        Shape shape = iter.next();\n        shape.printMe(s);\n    }\n}\n```\nThis will allow the `printShapes` method to accept an `ArrayList<String>` as a parameter, and use the `Iterator` to iterate through the `numbers` ArrayList and call the `printMe` method on each `Shape` object."}
