USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Finding Key associated with max Value in a Java Map: :What is the easiest way to get key associated with the max value in a map?I believe that Collections.max(someMap) will return the max Key, when you want the key that corresponds to the max value.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next()\n<<<code>>>: someMap.iterator().next()\n<<<explanation>>>: This code uses the Iterator.next() method to retrieve the key associated with the max value in the map. The iterator is obtained using the iterator() method of the map, and then the next() method is called to retrieve the key associated with the max value."}
