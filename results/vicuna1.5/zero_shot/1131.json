USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: how to read from file when I used PrintWriter, BufferedWriter and FileWriter to write?: :I have method which writes some data to file. I use PrintWriter, BufferedWriter and FileWriter as shown belowpublic void writeToFile(String FileName){    PrintWriter pw = null;    try {        pw = new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(FileName)));        for(Cars car : list){            pw.println(car.getType());            pw.println(car.getMaxSpeed());            pw.println(car.getOwner());            pw.println();            pw.flush();        }        pw.close();    }    catch(IOException ex){        System.err.println(ex);    }}Now how can I read this data from file? I tried to use InputStreamReader, BufferedReader and FileInputStream, but my NetBeans shows me an error message    public void readFromFile() throws IOException {        InputStreamReader fr = null;        try {            fr = new InputStreamReader(new BufferedReader(new FileInputStream(new FileReader(\"c:\\\\cars.txt\"))));            System.out.println(fr.read());        } catch (Exception ex) {            System.out.println(ex.getMessage());        } finally {            fr.close();        }    }  What is wrong with this method?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: public void readFromFile() throws IOException {\nString filePath = \"c:\\\\cars.txt\";\nString content = new String(Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get(filePath)));\nString[] tokens = content.split(\"\\\\s+\");\nfor (String token : tokens) {\nSystem.out.println(StringTokenizer.nextToken(token));\n}\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The issue with the previous method is that it is trying to read the file as a whole and then splitting the content into tokens. This approach will not work because the file content is written line by line using PrintWriter. To read the file correctly, we need to split the content into tokens based on the line breaks. The StringTokenizer class can be used for this purpose. The code above reads the content of the file, splits it into tokens, and then prints each token using the StringTokenizer.nextToken method."}
