USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to return Arrays.asList() in ordered list<String>?: :I don't know this is duplicate or not. If so, please share the link as I don't find anyone yet.In my Java program, I have a String like following(String is created dynamically).String header=\"Requirements ID,Requirements Number,Requirements Desc,Requirements Text,Requirements Date\";Now I am creating a ListList<String> csv = new ArrayList<String>(); csv=Arrays.asList(header.split(\"\\\\s*,\\\\s*\")); //splittng each phrase separated by commaBut I am not getting List value in an unordered way. I mean I get the list value like this[Requirements Number,Requirements Date,Requirements Desc,Requirements ID,Requirements Text]I know list is unordered. But I want the list csv be like this[Requirements ID,Requirements Number,Requirements Desc,Requirements Text,Requirements Date]So my question is how to get this in ordered way? Any possible solution?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: csv = new ArrayList<String>(); csv = Arrays.asList(header.split(\"\\\\s*,\\\\s*\")); csv = csv.stream().map(StringTokenizer.nextToken).collect(Collectors.toList());\n<<<explanation>>>: To get the list in the desired order, you can use the StringTokenizer class to split the header into individual tokens, and then map each token to its corresponding element in the list using the nextToken method. Finally, you can collect the list using the collect method with a mapping function that maps each token to its corresponding element."}
