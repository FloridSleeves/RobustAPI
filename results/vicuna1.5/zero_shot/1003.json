Unfortunately I am not able to get any of them. I have mentioned PHP example below.  public function GenerateSignature($Secret,$PathAndQuery)     {       return base64_encode(\\Zend_Crypt_Hmac::compute($Secret, 'sha256',       $PathAndQuery, \\Zend_Crypt_Hmac::BINARY));     }Can anyone please explain me how can I achieve the same with Java code? I have tried below code but it seems it's not generating proper outcome. public static String generateSignature(String secrete, String pathAndQuery){        String encoded = null;        try {            MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\");            md.update(secrete.getBytes(\"UTF-8\"));            md.update(pathAndQuery.getBytes(\"UTF-8\"));            byte[] digest = md.digest();            encoded = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(digest);        } catch (Exception e) {            e.printStackTrace();        }        return encoded;    }NOTE : I have used Java-8 for while writing above code. \nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: String.getBytes()\n<<<code>>>: String.getBytes(\"UTF-8\")\n<<<explanation>>>: The given PHP code uses Zend\\_Crypt\\_Hmac to generate a signature. In Java, you can use the Java Secure Random API to generate a hash. However, the Zend\\_Crypt\\_Hmac class in PHP uses the SHA-256 algorithm, which is not available in the Java Secure Random API. Instead, you can use the MessageDigest class to generate a hash using the SHA-256 algorithm. The getBytes() method is used to convert the string to an array of bytes, and the UTF-8 encoding is used to ensure that the bytes are in the correct format for the hash algorithm."}
