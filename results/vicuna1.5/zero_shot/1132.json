{"api": "StringTokenizer.nextToken", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can i pass all integers i this loop and stop before the last line: :this is my inputfirst line5 63 42 32 51 0word 2 2 4i need to add all the integers to a graph but not the last line (word 1 2 4).. i have splitted the first line (first line etc.) and put them in a arraylist.. No problem therebut then i have this for-loopfor (int i = 0; i < (amount of lines); i++) {        StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());        graph.addEdge(Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken()), Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken()));    }i cant write in the code how many times i want it to put integers, because my code should run generally with other inputs...How can i make it stop before the last line, i still need to be able to use the last bufferreaderline\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: for (int i = 0; i < (amount of lines); i++) {\nStringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());\ngraph.addEdge(Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken()), Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken()));\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: To stop the loop before the last line, you can add a condition to check if the current line is not the last line and only add the edges to the graph if it is not the last line. You can use the `!=` operator to check if a line is not equal to the last line.\nYou can also use the `skip(1)` method to skip the next line after adding the edge to the graph.\nSo the modified code will look like this:\nfor (int i = 0; i < (amount of lines); i++) {\nif (!in.readLine().equals(\"word\")) {\nStringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());\ngraph.addEdge(Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken()), Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken()));\nin.skip(1);\n}\n}"}
