USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Removing duplicates in ArrayList w/o Hashset: :I am able to remove most of the duplicates except for the ones that are right next to each other. I have no idea what I am doing wrong. Right now I have nested for loops comparing an int to the rest in the ArrayList. except how I either setup or increment I am skipping the duplicate next to where I start the first for loop over again. I have found it useful to reset my i=0 after I remove my index j. It still won't remove the duplicate if they are right next to each other.for(int i=0;i<original.size();i++){    for(int j=i+1;j<original.size();j++){        if(original.get(i)==original.get(j)){            original.remove(j);           }    }}EDIT: I found my solution, when I changed my second for loop to a while loop, then incremented each time, but when I found a duplicate I removed 1 from j. That way I would be starting over.Thank you all. \nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: original.iterator().next\n<<<explanation>>>: The issue with the original code is that it is using two nested for loops to compare each element in the ArrayList with the next one. However, when the two elements being compared are right next to each other, the second loop will start again at the next element, causing the duplicate to be skipped. To fix this, you can use the Iterator.next() method to move to the next element in the ArrayList after removing a duplicate, allowing the second loop to start again at the correct position."}
