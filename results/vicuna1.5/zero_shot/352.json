USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: join multiple iterators in java: :Does anybody know how to join multiple iterators in Java? The solution I found iterate through one iterator first, and then move on to the next one. However, what I want is when next() gets called, it first returns the first element from the first iterator. Next time when next() gets called, it returns the first element from the second iterator, and so on.Thanks\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: Iterator iterator1 = myList.iterator();\nIterator iterator2 = myOtherList.iterator();\nwhile (iterator1.hasNext()) {\nSystem.out.println(iterator1.next());\n}\nwhile (iterator2.hasNext()) {\nSystem.out.println(iterator2.next());\n}\n```\nExplanation:\nThis code uses two iterators to iterate through two different lists. The first iterator is used to iterate through the first list, and the second iterator is used to iterate through the second list. The while loop is used to iterate through each iterator until it reaches the end of the list. The next() method is called on each iterator to move to the next element in the list. The first element returned by the next() method is printed to the console for each iterator.\n```"}
