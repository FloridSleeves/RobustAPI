{"api": "InputStream.read", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Any byte >= 128 is received as 65533: :I am implementing a server on Android and I am using:while (!Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) {    try {        int r;        String response = \"\";        while ((r = input.read()) > 0) {        ...        }    ...}I have two issues. If the client sends me a byte of value 0, it is not received by the server. The second issue is, if the byte value is 128 or more, I keep receiving a value of 65533 or a binary value of 11111101. Anyone knows how to solve these issues. I am a beginner in networking on JAVA.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read()\n<<<code>>>: while ((r = input.read()) > 0) { ... }\n<<<explanation>>>: The issue with reading zero bytes is because the while loop condition is checking for a non-zero value. To fix this, you can modify the condition to check for a specific byte value or use a different approach to handle zero bytes. The issue with reading high byte values is because the while loop is reading one byte at a time, and any byte value greater than 127 will be interpreted as 128 in two's complement representation. To fix this, you can use the Byte.parseByte() method to parse the received byte value and check if it is within the expected range."}
