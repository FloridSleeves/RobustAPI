{"api": "DataOutputStream.write", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Implementation Prefix Mode: :I'm developing a server-client application.The server is done in Java (PC) and the client in Java. (Android)I'm having trouble with the following implementation:Server grabs bitmap -> raw bytes -> TCP -> Client (Async StreamsNow the byte array is delivered in multiple packets of different lengths in the client. So to handle this properly, I should use the prefix method.To use prefix mode you need to send the length of the message in bytes  as four bytes and then the messageMy codepublic void sendScreenshot(byte[] buffer) throws IOException {    OutputStream os = socket.getOutputStream();    os.write(buffer.length + 1);    os.write((byte) 0);    os.write(buffer, 0, buffer.length);    os.flush();}In VB.net, this is achieved in the following code:Private Sub dat(ByVal dat As String)    Dim nstream As NetworkStream = sock.GetStream()    Dim bit As Byte() = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(dat)    Dim bw As New BinaryWriter(sock.GetStream())    bw.Write(bit.Length + 1)    bw.Write((byte)command)    bw.Write(bit, 0, bit.length)End SubAny help implementing it in Java is welcome?\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: DataOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>: public void sendScreenshot(byte[] buffer) throws IOException {\nDataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());\ndos.writeInt(buffer.length);\ndos.write(buffer, 0, buffer.length);\ndos.flush();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: This code uses the DataOutputStream.writeInt() method to write the length of the message in bytes as a 4-byte integer, followed by the message itself, which is written using the DataOutputStream.write() method. The flush() method is called to ensure that the data is sent immediately."}
