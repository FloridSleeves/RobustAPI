USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to move data from java InputStream to a char * in c++ with jni?: :How can I move the data stored in a java InputStream to a char * in c++ using JNI?Thanks,Carlos.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.io.InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: java.nio.ByteBuffer.wrap(InputStream.getBuffer()).order(ByteOrder.LITTLE_ENDIAN).asCharBuffer().flip().getCharArray(0, (char[])null)\n<<<explanation>>>: To move data from a Java InputStream to a char \\* in C++, you can use the JNI API to call the Java method InputStream.read() and pass in a ByteBuffer. Then, you can wrap the ByteBuffer in a CharBuffer and flip the position to the beginning. Finally, you can get the char \\* array using the CharBuffer.getCharArray() method. Note that the returned char \\* array is read-only and should not be modified."}
