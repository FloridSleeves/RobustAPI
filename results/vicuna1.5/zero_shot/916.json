USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Refreshing VCards in OpenFire: :I developed a VCard plugin for OpenFire XMPP server with the main purpose of creating/updating and retrieving users' avatars via HTTP requests. Unfortunately, the plugin does not work as expected - VCard changes are propogated into the database (ofVcard table), but neither the user whose userpic was updated nor his buddies see the refreshed image. Here is how I create/update the VCards:   ...   XMPPServer server = XMPPServer.getInstance();   VCardManager vcardManager = server.getVCardManager();public void createOrUpdateVcard(String username, String vcard)                              throws Exception {                    SAXReader reader = new SAXReader();                    reader.setValidation(false);                    // convert String into InputStream                    InputStream is = new ByteArrayInputStream(vcard.getBytes());                    // read it with BufferedReader                    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(is));                    try {                              // Reading malformed XML will lead to DocumentException                              Document document = reader.read(is);                              Element vCardElement = document.getRootElement();                              log.info(\"Username: \" + username);                              vcardManager.setVCard(username, vCardElement);                    } catch (DocumentException e) {                              throw new MalformedXmlException(e);                    }     }     ...When I change avatars directly from the client (we are using Jitsi), the changes are not only immediately stored in the database, but all the buddies get the refreshed image. I see that VCardManager, which I use, dispatches events internally:VCardEventDispatcher.dispatchVCardUpdated(username, newvCard);but they seem not to have any effect.I cannot figure out what is the difference between the way the setVcard method is called from the handleIQ(IQ packet) in IQvCardHandler and in my own code. What am I missing?\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.lang.String.getBytes()\n<<<code>>>: String vcard = \"newvCard\";\n<<<explanation>>>: It seems that the issue might be related to the way the VCard data is being sent to the server. Instead of using the String.getBytes() method to convert the VCard data to bytes, you can try using the XML serialization method to convert the VCard data to a string first, and then use the InputStream.getBytes() method to convert it to bytes. This way, you can ensure that the VCard data is properly formatted and can be properly parsed by the server."}
