USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: decode large base64 from xml in java: OutOfMemory: :I need to write a base64 encoded element of an xml file into a separate file. Problem: the file could easily reach the size of 100 MB. Every solution I tried ended with the \"java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space\". The problem is not reading the xml in general or the decoding process, but the size of the base64 block.I used jdom, dom4j and XMLStreamReader to access the xml file. However, as soon as I want to access the base64 content of the respective element I get the mentioned error. I also tried an xslt using saxon's base64Binary-to-octets function, but of course with the same result.Is there a way to stream this base64 encoded part into a file without getting the whole chunk in one single piece?Thanks for your hints,Andreas\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: writer.write(base64EncodedElement);\n<<<explanation>>>: This code will write the base64EncodedElement to a file using the PrintWriter.write method. The base64EncodedElement can be decoded from the XML file using a base64 decoding library, such as Base64.decode(base64EncodedElement). This will allow you to write the decoded data to a separate file without running out of memory."}
