USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to create OAuth HMAC-SHA1 signature on GAE/J?: :EDIT: java equivalent to php's hmac-SHA1(well hopefully, trying a.t.m.)My understanding is that to create a signature I need a 'base string' and a 'key'. I guess I know how to create the base string, and I assume I'm supposed to use 'OAuth Consumer Secret' that Google have assigned to my app as the key.But what am I supposed to do with these two to obtain the signature? Is there any HMAC-class on GAE/Java?Would it play if I just stored somewhere what OAuth Playground generates for me? Is it how you do it? Or does OAuth signature have some expiration date?(I tried AuthSub before but failed too, even though it looks quite simple. Also OAuth seems like more 'standard' to me, so I'd like to stick with OAuth.)\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "To create an OAuth HMAC-SHA1 signature in GAE/J, you can use the `Hmac` class from the `javax.crypto` API. Here's an example code snippet:\n\n<<<api>>>: javax.crypto.Hmac\n<<<code>>>: Hmac hmac = new Hmac(Hmac.ALGORITHM_SHA1, \"OAuth Consumer Secret\".getBytes());\nhmac.update(\"base string\".getBytes());\nString signature = hmac.digest().toString();\n\nThe `Hmac` class takes two parameters: the algorithm to use for hashing (in this case, SHA1) and the key to use for the HMAC (in this case, the OAuth Consumer Secret). The `update` method is used to add data to the message digest, and the `digest` method returns the final message digest as a byte array. Finally, the `toString` method is used to convert the message digest to a hexadecimal string, which is the signature.\n\nYou can store the signature in your database or use it in your API request as needed. The signature does not have an expiration date, but the OAuth access token does have an expiration time, so you should make sure to refresh the access token periodically.\n\nNote that the `Hmac` class is not part of the standard Java API, so you may need to add the `javax.crypto` library to your project to use it."}
