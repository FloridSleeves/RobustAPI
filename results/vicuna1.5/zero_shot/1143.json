The data inside is as following,N12  3934  2312  225   77   1011  8  .  .  .left column contains the x value of each point. Right column contains y value of each point. N is the number of lines Point data that follow. I need to extract all the Point data and store it in a data structure(such as List). Is there any way I can do that?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String file = \"filename.txt\";\nStringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(file);\nList<String> points = new ArrayList<>();\nwhile (st.hasMoreTokens()) {\nString token = st.nextToken();\nif (token.startsWith(\"N\")) {\nint x = Integer.parseInt(token.substring(1));\nint y = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\npoints.add(x + \",\" + y);\n}\n}\nSystem.out.println(points);\n\nExplanation:\nThe given code uses the StringTokenizer class to extract the x and y values of each point from the txt file. The file is first read into a string called \"file\". Then, a StringTokenizer object \"st\" is created and used to iterate through the lines of the file. For each line, if it starts with the character 'N', the x and y values are extracted and added to a list called \"points\". Finally, the list is printed to the console."}
