USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Convert InputStream to byte array in Java: :How do I read an entire InputStream into a byte array?\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.io.DataOutputStream\n<<<code>>>: DataOutputStream out = new DataOutputStream(inputStream);\nout.writeInt(0); // write any integer value to indicate the end of the stream\nout.close();\n\n<<<explanation>>>: To read an entire InputStream into a byte array in Java, you can use the DataOutputStream class to write the contents of the InputStream to a byte array. First, create a new DataOutputStream object and pass in the InputStream object as the argument. Then, write any integer value to indicate the end of the stream. Finally, close the DataOutputStream object. The byte array can then be accessed using the DataInputStream class."}
