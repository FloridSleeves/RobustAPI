USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to save the text file in a path given by JFileChooser?: :I need to save a text File which is already created in a particular path given by JFileChooser. What I do basically to save is:public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {   JFileChooser chooser = new JFileChooser();   int status = chooser.showSaveDialog(null);   if (status == JFileChooser.APPROVE_OPTION) {      System.out.print(chooser.getCurrentDirectory());      // Don't know how to do it   }How to save the text file in a path given by JFileChooser?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.io.PrintWriter\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter.write(String)\n<<<explanation>>>: To save a text file in a path given by JFileChooser using PrintWriter.write, you can use the following code:\n```java\nPrintWriter writer = null;\ntry {\n    writer = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(chooser.getSelectedFile().getAbsolutePath()));\n    writer.write(\"Your text here\");\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n} finally {\n    if (writer != null) {\n        try {\n            writer.close();\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code creates a PrintWriter object and writes the text to the file using the FileWriter object. The FileWriter object is used to write the text to the selected file in the JFileChooser. The try-catch-finally block is used to handle any exceptions that may occur during the writing process."}
