{"api": "Iterator.next", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Check if Class<T> is primitive and if its String, Number, Boolean, List or Map?: :I have this code that I am having trouble with:public static <T> T createPOJOFrom(Class<T> clazz, Entity source){    T obj = null;    if (clazz.isPrimitive()){        Map<String,Object> props = source.getProperties();        Iterator<Map.Entry<String,Object>> it = props.entrySet().iterator();        Object prop = it.next();        obj = (T) prop; // FIXME this can be dangerous!    } else {        obj = createPOJOFrom(clazz, createMapFromEntity(source));    }    return obj;}Question 1:The problem is clazz.isPrimitive returns false because I can see in the debug console that clazz = class java.lang.String, now how  do I also do a check for String, Number, Boolean, List and Map?What could be wrong in this code?Question 2:If ever question 1 is fixed, what is the safest way to assign Object prop to T, example if T is a String, then it would be String.valueOf right? What if its primitive like int, long, char?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.util.Iterator\n<<<code>>>: Iterator.next()\n<<<explanation>>>: The `Iterator.next()` method returns the next element in the iteration order of the iterator. It throws a `NoSuchElementException` if the end of the iterator has been reached. In the given code, `Iterator.next()` is used to retrieve the next element in the `props` map, which is then assigned to the `prop` variable. However, this approach can be dangerous because it assumes that the `props` map only contains key-value pairs of the same type. To handle different types of key-value pairs, the code should use a `Map.Entry` iterator instead."}
