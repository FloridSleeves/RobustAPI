I cannot get know how to save the results in output file that second array is save in a lower line.This is how it saves:dist[0 10 13 10 6 18 ] pred[-15 2 5 1 4 ] I want it to save like this:dist[0 10 13 10 6 18 ]pred[-15 2 5 1 4 ]CODE:try{outputFile = new File(\"Out0304.txt\");out = new FileWriter(outputFile);out.write(\"\\n\" + \"dist[\");out.write(\"\\n\");for (Top way : tops){    out.write(way.shortest_path + \" \");}out.write(\"]\\n\");out.write(\"\\n\");out.write(\"\\n\" + \"pred[\");for (Top ww : tops){    if (ww.previous != null) {        out.write(ww.previous.number + \" \");    }            else{        out.write(\"-1\");    }}out.write(\"] \\n \");out.close();}  catch (IOException e){System.out.println(\"Blad: \" + e.toString());}}}\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try{outputFile = new File(\"Out0304.txt\");out = new PrintWriter(outputFile);out.write(\"\\n\" + \"dist[\");out.write(\"\\n\");for (Top way : tops){out.write(way.shortest_path + \" \");}out.write(\"]\\n\");out.write(\"\\n\");out.write(\"\\n\" + \"pred[\");for (Top ww : tops){if (ww.previous != null) {out.write(ww.previous.number + \" \");}else{out.write(\"-1\");}}out.write(\"] \\n \");out.close();} catch (IOException e){System.out.println(\"Blad: \" + e.toString());}}\n\nExplanation:\nTo save the results in an output file using the PrintWriter.write method, you need to first create a PrintWriter object and then use its write method to write the desired output to the file. In this case, you want to save the contents of the dist and pred arrays in the output file.\n\nTo save the contents of the dist array, you can use the PrintWriter.write method to write the \"dist[\" prefix followed by a newline character, and then iterate through the tops array and write each way's shortest path to the file. To save the contents of the pred array, you can use the same approach, but you need to check if the previous way is null before writing its number to the file. If it is null, you should write -1 instead.\n\nFinally, you need to close the PrintWriter object to ensure that the output file is properly closed and any remaining data is written to the file. If an IOException occurs while writing to the file, you can catch it and print an error message."}
