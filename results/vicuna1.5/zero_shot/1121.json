{"api": "StringTokenizer.nextToken", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Create a string array with length determined by user input: :I am trying to create an array that reads string tokens from standard input, and places them in an array, and then prints the words out, until it reaches a specific word. For example, let's say I wanted my array to read a series of words until it reached the word \"okay\" from std in, print out each word, and then terminate before printing out \"okay\". The length of this array will be unknown, so I am confused on how to do this.     String s  = sc.next();     String[] copy = new String[???];     for( int i = 0; i < copy.length; i++ ){           copy[i] = sc.next();          }\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.util.StringTokenizer\n<<<code>>>: StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(s);\nwhile (st.hasMoreTokens()) {\nString token = st.nextToken();\nif (token.equals(\"okay\")) {\nbreak;\n}\nSystem.out.println(token);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: This code uses the StringTokenizer class to tokenize the input string into individual words. The while loop continues to execute as long as the tokenizer has more tokens to read. In each iteration, the next token is retrieved using the nextToken() method and printed out. The condition to break the loop is added if the token \"okay\" is encountered, which will terminate the loop before it reaches that word."}
