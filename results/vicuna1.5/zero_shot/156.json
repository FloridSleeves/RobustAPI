I want to display a ProgressDialog which should have a progress bar to show the status of the download. I'm using the onProgressUpdate() function for that and implemented a call to publishProgress() in my doInBackground() function. However, the progress dialog only pops up after downloading the file. My code:protected Long doInBackground(URL...urls) {    for (int i = 0; i < urls.length; i++) {        url = urls[i];        try {            URLConnection conn = url.openConnection();            conn.connect();            totalSize = conn.getContentLength();            BufferedInputStream bis = new BufferedInputStream(url.openStream());            FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().getPath() + \"/forvo_temp.mp3\");            BufferedOutputStream bos = new BufferedOutputStream(fos,1024);            byte [] data = new byte[1024];            int x=0; int c=0;            while((x=bis.read(data,0,1024))>=0){                bos.write(data,0,x);                c += 1024;                publishProgress(c);            }        } catch (Exception e) {            e.printStackTrace();        }    }    return 0L; // Don't know what to do with this}protected void onProgressUpdate(Integer...args) {    pd = ProgressDialog.show(context, \"Downloading...\", \"Downloading...\", true, false);    pd.setProgress(args[0] / totalSize);}I guess the whole file is downloaded when I call new BufferedInputStream(url.openStream()). How can I monitor the download progress?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.io.InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: bis.read(data, 0, 1024)\n<<<explanation>>>: The issue with your current code is that you are reading the entire file into memory at once, which is causing the progress dialog to only appear after the entire file has been downloaded. To monitor the download progress, you should use the InputStream.read() method to read the file in chunks, and update the progress bar accordingly. The bis.read(data, 0, 1024) method should be replaced with a loop that reads the file in 1024-byte chunks and updates the progress bar after each chunk."}
