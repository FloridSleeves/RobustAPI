{"api": "BufferedReader.readLine", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Read file and get key=value without using java.util.Properties: :I'm building a RMI game and the client would load a file that has some keys and values which are going to be used on several different objects. It is a save game file but I can't use java.util.Properties for this (it is under the specification). I have to read the entire file and ignore commented lines and the keys that are not relevant in some classes. These properties are unique but they may be sorted in any order. My file current file looks like this:# BioplayerOrigin=NewlandsplayerClass=Warlock# ArmorplayerHelmet=emptyplayerUpperArmor=armor900playerBottomArmor=armor457playerBoots=boot109etcThese properties are going to be written and placed according to the player's progress and the filereader would have to reach the end of file and get only the matched keys. I've tried different approaches but so far nothing came close to the results that I would had using java.util.Properties. Any idea?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"savegame.txt\")); String line = reader.readLine(); while (line != null) { if (!line.startsWith(\"#\") && !line.isEmpty()) { String[] keyValue = line.split(\"=\"); String key = keyValue[0]; String value = keyValue[1]; // do something with key and value } line = reader.readLine(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: This code reads the savegame.txt file using a BufferedReader and reads each line. It checks if the line starts with \"#\" or is empty, and if not, it splits the line by \"=\" to get the key and value. The key and value are then processed according to the game's needs. The code continues to read lines until the end of the file is reached."}
