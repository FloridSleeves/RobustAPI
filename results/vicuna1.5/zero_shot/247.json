USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: reading c# binary files in java: :I have a program in C# .net which writes 1 integer and 3 strings to a file, using BinaryWriter.Write(). Now I am programming in Java (for Android, and I'm new in Java), and I have to access the data which were previously written to a file using C#. I tried using DataInputStream.readInt() and DataInputStream.readUTF(), but I can't get proper results. I usually get a UTFDataFormatException: java.io.UTFDataFormatException: malformed input around byte 21or the String and int I get is wrong...FileInputStream fs = new FileInputStream(strFilePath);DataInputStream ds = new DataInputStream(fs);int i;String str1,str2,str3;i=ds.readInt();str1=ds.readUTF();str2=ds.readUTF();str3=ds.readUTF();ds.close();What is the proper way of doing this?   \nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read.\n<<<code>>>: FileInputStream fs = new FileInputStream(strFilePath); DataInputStream ds = new DataInputStream(fs); int i; String str1, str2, str3; i = ds.readInt(); str1 = ds.readUTF(); str2 = ds.readUTF(); str3 = ds.readUTF(); ds.close();\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe issue with the previous code is that it is using the `readUTF()` method to read the strings, which is not the correct way to read binary data from a file in Java. Instead, you should use the `readInt()` method to read the integer value and then use the `readUTF()` method to read the strings.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\nFileInputStream fs = new FileInputStream(strFilePath);\nDataInputStream ds = new DataInputStream(fs);\nint i;\nString str1, str2, str3;\ni = ds.readInt();\nstr1 = new String(ds.readBytes(4), \"UTF-8\");\nstr2 = new String(ds.readBytes(4), \"UTF-8\");\nstr3 = new String(ds.readBytes(4), \"UTF-8\");\nds.close();\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe `readInt()` method is used to read the integer value from the file. Then, the `readBytes()` method is used to read the 4 bytes required to represent a UTF-16 encoded string in Java. The resulting bytes are then converted to a string using the `String()` constructor with the \"UTF-8\" encoding. This is the proper way to read binary data from a file in Java."}
