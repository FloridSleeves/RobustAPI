USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to return \"result\" from one class to a defined class?: :I am working with ViewPager i.e on top of the MainActivity class and the Viewpager class extends fragment.The problem is that, normally when we need a class to return some result then while passing the intent we use startActivityforresult(intent,int) hence it passes the result captured in the secondactivity the class from where it's been called.But as i am working with viewpager on top of the mainactivity and i am using floating action button, when i click the button to open the second activity it returns the result to the mainactivity but not the viewpager class.So my question is how can i pass the result taken from the secondactivity to my desired class?Update::MainActivity.javathis is my main class which is using the intent as well as receiving the result from the second activity class ActivityTwoWhat i have done here is startActivityForResult(intent,1);public void onActivityresult(i,j,intent){MyFragment fragment;fragment.onActivityReusult(i,j,intent);//Here i have passes the values      received by this class to the fragment class where i need the values but it's not working}\nPlease using this api: List.get.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: List.get()\n<<<code>>>: MainActivity.this.getList()\n<<<explanation>>>: To pass the result from the second activity to the ViewPager class, you can use the `startActivityForResult()` method in the MainActivity class and get the result using the `getList()` method in the MainActivity class. In the ViewPager class, you can then access the result using `MainActivity.this.getList()`."}
