This is causing an `IOException` to be thrown when the `readLine()` method is called, which in turn is causing the `getMessageFromServer()` method to return a `Null String`. To fix this, you can add a `close()` method call after the `out.write()` method call in the `sendMessageToServer()` method of the `ClientSocket` class. This will ensure that the input stream of the `BufferedReader` object is properly closed, and the `readLine()` method can be called without throwing an `IOException`.\n\nHere is the updated code:\n\n<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: out.write(message);\n<<<explanation>>>: This line of code sends the message passed as an argument to the server.\n\n<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine()\n<<<code>>>: in.readLine();\n<<<explanation>>>: This line of code reads a line of text from the input stream of the `BufferedReader` object.\n\n<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.close()\n<<<code>>>: in.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: This line of code closes the input stream of the `BufferedReader` object.\n\n<<<api>>>: Socket.getMessageFromServer()\n<<<code>>>: clientSocket.getMessageFromServer();\n<<<explanation>>>: This line of code calls the `getMessageFromServer()` method of the `clientSocket` object to retrieve the message received from the server.\n\nWith these changes, the code should work as expected and print the message received from the server when the `System.out.println(clientSocket.getMessageFromServer());` line is executed."}
