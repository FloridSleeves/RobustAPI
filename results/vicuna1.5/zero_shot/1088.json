The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java, Swing, sql- Can I match a value entered in textfield with two column in the database: :Can I match a value entered in textfield with two column in the database.It is required in a application which has  options of \"Save\" and \"search\" according to the id but id is in combined form of String and Integer (eg abc/345) and the next id is incremented version of last id ie abc/346,abc/347 So I create two columns to store id in database , first for string part and second for integer partproblem is that When I enter full id ie abc/345 in textfield and click on the \"Search button\" then the other fields should be fill according to this full id\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.util.StringTokenizer\n<<<code>>>: StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(\"abc/345\");\nst.nextToken(); // gets the string part of the id\nint part = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken()); // gets the integer part of the id\n<<<explanation>>>: Yes, you can use the StringTokenizer class to split the combined id into its string and integer parts. The nextToken() method can be used to retrieve the next token in the string, and the parseInt() method can be used to convert the next token to an integer. In this case, the first nextToken() call will return the string part of the id, and the second call will return the integer part of the id."}
