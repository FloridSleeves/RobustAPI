Improve this question                    This is my code in which I try to write data(Ime-name, Pasma-breed, Starost-age, Teza-weight) in to arraylist an then from array list to .txt file. It has to be done for 5 Dogs(Pes) so I have used for i was hoping if someone could check it and give me a feedback to this. I have got problems with writing to array list and then to .txt file.Thanks :)import java.io.File;import java.io.FileWriter;import java.util.ArrayList;import java.util.Scanner;class Pes {    private String Ime;    private String Pasma;    private int Starost;    private double Teza;    public void setIme(String Ime) {        this.Ime = Ime;    }    public String getIme() {        return Ime;    }    public void setPasma(String Pasma) {        this.Pasma = Pasma;    }    public String getPasma() {        return Pasma;    }    public void setStarost(int Starost) {        this.Starost = Starost;    }    public int getStarost() {        return Starost;    }    public void setTeza(double Teza) {        this.Teza = Teza;    }    public double getTeza() {        return Teza;    }    Pes() {        Ime = \"\";        Pasma = \"\";        Starost = 0;        Teza = 0;    }}public class Aplikacija {    public static void main(String[] args) {        new File(\"Psi.txt\");        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);        for (int i = 0; i <= 5; i++) {            System.out.println(\"Vpi\u0161ite ime!\");            String Ime = input.nextLine();            System.out.println(\"Vpi\u0161ite pasmo!\");            String Pasma = input.nextLine();            System.out.println(\"Izberite starost!\");            int Starost = input.nextInt();            System.out.println(\"Izberite tezo!\");            double Teza = input.nextDouble();            Pes Pes1 = new Pes();            Pes1.setIme(Ime);            Pes1.setPasma(Pasma);            Pes1.setStarost(Starost);            Pes1.setTeza(Teza);            new ArrayList<Pes>();            Pes1.add(new Pes(Ime, Pasma, Starost, Teza));            input.close();        }        FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(\"Psi.txt\");        for (String str : arr) {            writer.write(str);        }        writer.close();    }}\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: Aplikacija.main(String[] args)\n<<<explanation>>>: The given code is a Java program that reads input from the user for 5 dogs and stores the data in an ArrayList. The program then writes the data from the ArrayList to a text file named \"Psi.txt\". The issue with the code is that it is not properly writing the data to the text file. The PrintWriter.write() method is used to write the data to the file, but it is not being used correctly. The method should be called within a loop that iterates through the ArrayList and writes each dog's data to a new line in the file. Additionally, the method should be called after the file has been opened with the FileWriter class."}
