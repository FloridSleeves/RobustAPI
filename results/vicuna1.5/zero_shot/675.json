The issue is that you are creating a PrintWriter object but not writing any content to it. To fix this, you need to call the write() method of the PrintWriter object and pass the content you want to write to the file. In this case, you want to write the string \"hello\" to the file, so you should call the write() method and pass the string as an argument. Additionally, you need to close the PrintWriter object to ensure that any pending output is written to the file."}
