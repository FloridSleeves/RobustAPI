In this case, we can use the `getInstance()` method to get an iterator for the `instanceMap` and then call `Iterator.next()` to retrieve the next element, which will be the `Conf` object associated with the given `confID`. This will allow us to clear the key and value of `instanceMap` automatically when the `Conf` object is garbage collected."}
