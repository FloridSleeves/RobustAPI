It's suppose to make a new token when there's a comma followed by a space or when a new line is created, but after the 4 tokens, it throws the NoSuchElementException.    private Map<String, Double> createElementMassMap(String filePath) {    Map<String, Double> elementMap = new HashMap<>();    try (Scanner sc = new Scanner(new FileReader(filePath))) {        sc.useDelimiter(Pattern.compile(\"(, ) | (\\r\\n)\"));        sc.useLocale(Locale.US);        while(sc.hasNext()) {            String name = sc.next();            System.out.println(name);            double mass = sc.nextDouble();            System.out.println(mass);            elementMap.put(name, mass);        }    } catch (IOException e) {        e.printStackTrace();        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(self, \"Error loading ElementMasses file.\", \"IOException\", JOptionPane.ERROR_MESSAGE);    }     return elementMap;}Here's the file it's trying to readH, 1.00O, 16.00and i made sure there isn't an empty line in the file.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.util.Scanner\n<<<code>>>: sc.nextLine()\n<<<explanation>>>: The issue with the code is that it is using a regular expression to split the input string using commas and newlines. However, the regular expression is not properly matching the input string. Instead of using a regular expression, you can use the `Scanner` class's `nextLine()` method to read the entire line and then split the line using the `StringTokenizer` class. This will correctly split the input string at the commas and newlines."}
