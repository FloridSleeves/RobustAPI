USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Problem in accessing elements from google HashMultimap: :I am using below code to get & process value from google HashMultimap    HashMultimap hmm = new HashMultimap();    HashMultimap hmm2 = new HashMultimap();    Element ele;:    hmm2.put(\"name\",\"Amit\");    hmm.put(\"Amit\",ele);    hmm.put(\"rohit\",hmm2); :       Iterator itr =  hmm.keys().iterator();    String ky = (String) itr.next();    System.out.println(hmm.get(ky));    ky = (String) itr.next();    System.out.println(hmm.get(ky));In above code, if map element(or entry) is Element type then i want to do some operation. If it is HashMultimap type then do some other operation. How can i check and pass the object to another function.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next()\n<<<code>>>: itr.next()\n<<<explanation>>>: The code you provided is trying to access the keys of the HashMultimap object hmm using an Iterator. The Iterator is being used to iterate over the keys of the HashMultimap, and the next() method is being called on the Iterator object itr to retrieve the next key. The next() method returns the next element in the Iterator, which is a key in this case. The keys are then being printed using the get() method of the HashMultimap object hmm."}
