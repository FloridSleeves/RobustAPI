If the player loses his health the explosion should be triggered. I made 3 Classes. Animation Class, an Explosion Class and GameActivity Class. I tried to only post the relevant pieces.I searched the internet but I could not find a solution to my problem. So I am asking you if you maybe see my mistake and could help me. If more code is needed I will edit it of course. Maybe I am just overlooking something. Animation Class{public void setFrames(Bitmap[] frames){this.frames = frames;currentFrame = 0;startTime = System.nanoTime();}public void setDelay(long d){delay = d;}public void setFrame(int i){currentFrame= i;}public void work(){long elapsed = (System.nanoTime()-startTime)/1000000;if(elapsed>delay){currentFrame++;startTime = System.nanoTime();}if(currentFrame == frames.length){currentFrame = 0;playedOnce = true; }}public Bitmap getImage(){return frames[currentFrame];}public int getFrame(){return currentFrame;}public boolean playedOnce(){return playedOnce; }}This is the relevant part of the Explosion Class:Bitmap[] image = new Bitmap[numFrames];//Bitmap has 4 * 4 framesfor (int i = 0; i < image.length; i++) {if (i % 4 == 0 && i > 0) row++;image[i] = Bitmap.createBitmap(spritesheet, (i - (4 * row)) * width,  row * height, width*4, height*4);}animation.setFrames(image);animation.setDelay(10);}public void animating() {if (!animation.playedOnce()) {animation.work(); }}If the player loses all his health I call the explosion in GameActivityif (player.getHealth() < 0) {// player bitmap disappearsdissapear = true;//game endsgameEnded=true;explosion = new Explosion(BitmapFactory.decodeResource(getResources(),   R.drawable.images),player.getX(),player.getY()-10,9,9,25);explosion.animating();\nPlease using this api: List.get.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: List.get\n<<<code>>>: Animation.getFrame()\n<<<explanation>>>: The issue with the animation stopping after the first frame is likely due to the fact that the currentFrame variable is not being updated correctly. In the Animation Class, the currentFrame should be updated to the value of the next frame after the work() method is called. To fix this, update the code in the Animation Class to:\n```java\npublic void work(){\n    long elapsed = (System.nanoTime()-startTime)/1000000;\n    if(elapsed>delay){\n        currentFrame++;\n        startTime = System.nanoTime();\n    }\n    if(currentFrame == frames.length){\n        currentFrame = 0;\n        playedOnce = true;\n    }\n}\n```\nThis will ensure that the currentFrame variable is updated to the value of the next frame after each iteration of the work() method, preventing the animation from stopping after the first frame."}
