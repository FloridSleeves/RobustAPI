USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Where compiled code will be stored if not in class file: :Recently I came across a query while reading THE STRUCTURE OF THE JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINEOn page no-5 ch. 2,Compiled code to be executed by the Java Virtual Machine is  represented using a hardware- and operating system-independent binary  format, typically (but not necessarily) stored in a file, known as the  class file format.That bracket But not necessarily is the reason.Question is, In which case compiled code will not be stored in class file ? and if it will not be stored in class file, then where and how ?Edit : Please note that question is not about ClassLoader.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter.write(\"Compiled code will not be stored in class file if it is generated by the Java compiler using the -target option with a value other than 'class'. In this case, the compiled code will be stored in the 'bin' directory of the current project.\"\n<<<explanation>>>: The PrintWriter.write method is used to write text to a file or output stream. In this case, we are using it to provide an explanation of when the compiled code is not stored in a class file. The explanation is that if the Java compiler is used with the -target option and a value other than 'class', the compiled code will not be stored in a class file. Instead, it will be stored in the 'bin' directory of the current project."}
