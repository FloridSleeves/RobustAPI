USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Ways to proxy an InputStream: :I am using Android-Universal-Image-Loader to load images from remote server over HTTPS on my Android application. To have access to images the client should provide a valid token and sometimes server can return \"expired crsf token\" error. In order to handle this behavior a custom ImageDownloader should be defined. Below is the base implementation of method that should be overrrided in my implementation.protected InputStream getStreamFromNetwork(String imageUri, Object extra) throws IOException {    HttpURLConnection conn = createConnection(imageUri, extra);    int redirectCount = 0;    while (conn.getResponseCode() / 100 == 3 && redirectCount < MAX_REDIRECT_COUNT) {         conn = createConnection(conn.getHeaderField(\"Location\"), extra);         redirectCount++;    }    InputStream imageStream;    try {         imageStream = conn.getInputStream();    } catch (IOException e) {         // Read all data to allow reuse connection (http://bit.ly/1ad35PY)         IoUtils.readAndCloseStream(conn.getErrorStream());         throw e;    }    if (!shouldBeProcessed(conn)) {         IoUtils.closeSilently(imageStream);         throw new IOException(\"Image request failed with response code \" + conn.getResponseCode());    }    return new ContentLengthInputStream(new BufferedInputStream(imageStream, BUFFER_SIZE), conn.getContentLength());}I want to rewrite it to handle invalid token errors. For example, if the server returns such error it should be recognized, token should be regenerated and request repeated. The only solution I come up with is like this (shortened code):imageStream = conn.getInputStream();byte[] body = org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils.toByteArray(imageStream);if (body.length < 300  // high probability to contain err message             && isInvalidToken(body)) {              // handle error}return new ByteArrayInputStream(body);Is is safe to use such kind of solution, considering I use it only for thumbnails of max 80kb size? Are there any other solutions?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.io.InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: imageStream.read()\n<<<explanation>>>: The code you provided is not safe to use as it can lead to a NullPointerException if the input stream is null. Instead, you should use the read() method of the InputStream class to read the contents of the stream. The read() method reads a single byte of data from the input stream and returns it as an integer. If the end of the stream is reached, it returns -1. You can use this method to read the contents of the input stream and check if it contains the \"expired crsf token\" error message. If it does, you can regenerate the token and repeat the request. However, it is important to note that this solution may not be suitable for larger files as it can cause out-of-memory errors."}
