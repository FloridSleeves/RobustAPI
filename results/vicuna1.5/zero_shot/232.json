And pngs for example are not completely viewable.I really don't know why it stops earlier.Sending small testfiles(~1 kb) works great.The server part:                    ServerSocket fileSocket = new ServerSocket(p);                    boolean rdy = false;                    while (!rdy) {                        Socket client = fileSocket.accept();                        String fileName = \"C:/\" + args[2];                        String cmd = fileName + \"\\n\";                        OutputStreamWriter sWriter = new OutputStreamWriter(client.getOutputStream());                        sWriter.write(cmd, 0, cmd.length());                        sWriter.flush();                        InputStream inStream = client.getInputStream();                        FileOutputStream fileStream = new FileOutputStream(fileName);                        byte[] buffer = new byte[client.getReceiveBufferSize()];                        int bytesRead = 0;                        while ((bytesRead = inStream.read(buffer)) > 0) {                            fileStream.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);                        }                        fileStream.flush();                        ta.append(\"File transfered\");                        inStream.close();                        fileStream.close();                        rdy = true;                    }                    fileSocket.close();                    return;The client part:Socket client = new Socket(ip, port);        OutputStream outStream = client.getOutputStream();        FileInputStream fileStream = new FileInputStream(fileName);        byte[] buffer = new byte[(int) fileStream.getChannel().size()];        int bytesRead = 0;        System.out.println(\"Sending file: \" + fileName);        while ((bytesRead = fileStream.read(buffer)) > 0) {            outStream.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);        }        outStream.close();        fileStream.close();        client.close();        return;\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.io.InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: client.getInputStream().read(buffer);\n<<<explanation>>>: The issue with the file transfer could be due to the buffer size used in the server's FileOutputStream.write method. The default buffer size is 8192 bytes, which might be too large for small files. To fix this, you can try reducing the buffer size by calling client.getInputStream().read(buffer) with a smaller buffer size. For example, if you want to use a buffer size of 4096 bytes, you can modify the client's while loop as follows:\n```java\nwhile ((bytesRead = fileStream.read(buffer)) > 0) {\n    outStream.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);\n}\n```\nYou can also try using a smaller buffer size in the server's FileOutputStream.write method. For example, you can use the following code to write the file in chunks of 4096 bytes:\n```java\nwhile ((bytesRead = inStream.read(buffer)) > 0) {\n    fileStream.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);\n}\n```\nThis should help transfer the files completely and improve the viewability of PNG files."}
