USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: remove item from comparable array: :I'm very new to java and my first question is what is this Comparable thing? and in my sample code, why Class Bag<T extends Comparable<T>>?? What's the purpose?My second question is how to remove an item from this Comparable array. I have wrote the removeMin method, I have found the item, I named the variable \"min\", how do I go on and remove this min item from the arrayList? Thanks a lot!Here's some partial code:public class Bag<T extends Comparable<T>> implements Iterable<T> {    private int MAX_ITEMS = 10; // initial array size    private int size;    private Comparable[] data;    public Bag( ) {        //data = (Comparable []) new Object[MAX_ITEMS];        data = (T []) new Comparable[MAX_ITEMS];        size = 0;    }      public Comparable removeMin(){          Iterator<T> iterator=iterator();          T min = iterator.next();          while (iterator.hasNext())          {               T next = iterator.next();             if (min.compareTo(next) > 0)                 min = next;                ****************************************************                How to remove this min item?                 ****************************************************                }          return min;          }\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: iterator.next()\n<<<explanation>>>: The method Iterator.next() returns the next element in the iteration order of the iterator. In the given code, the variable \"min\" is initialized to the next element in the iteration order of the iterator, which is the minimum element in the array. To remove this minimum element from the array, you can use the following code:\n\nmin = iterator.next();\ndata[size] = iterator.previous();\nsize--;\n\nThis code gets the next element in the iteration order of the iterator, stores it in the \"min\" variable, and then gets the previous element in the iteration order of the iterator and assigns it to the position in the array where the minimum element was located. The size of the array is then decremented by one."}
