USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to send XML data through socket InputStream: :I'm trying to write a client-server application in Java with an XML-based protocol.But I have a great problem!See this part of client code:InputStream incoming = skt.getInputStream(); //I get Stream from Socket.OutputStream out = skt.getOutputStream();[...]XMLSerializer serializer = new XMLSerializer();//This create an XML document.tosend = WUTPClientWriter.createMessage100(projectid, cpuclock, cpunumber);serializer.setOutputByteStream(out);serializer.serialize(tosend);At this point server fall in deadlock. It wait for EOF but I can't send it because if I use out.close();orskt.shutdownOutput();I close the Socket and I must keep this connection alive.I can't send '\\0' becouse I get Parse Error in the server.How can I do it? Can I \"close\" the output stream without closing the socket?RESOLVEDI've created new class XMLStreamOutput and XMLStreamInput with advanced Stream gesture.\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.io.DataOutputStream\n<<<code>>>: dataOutputStream.write(xmlData);\n<<<explanation>>>: Instead of using the default output stream of the socket, you can use a DataOutputStream to write the XML data to the socket. This way, you can close the output stream without closing the socket."}
