USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Read/Write using FileChannel and FileInput/OutputStream-Java: :I am new to file handling. I tried reading a file using fileinputstream and file channel. I could not find out the bug in the following code. It runs successfully but file has not been transferred. New file is created with zero bytes. Please have a look at the code and check what went wrongpublic class FileTest{    public static void main(String[] args)    {           try {            File file = new File(\"sss.jpg\");            FileChannel inChannel=new FileInputStream(file).getChannel();            //FileChannel inChannel = in.getChannel();            ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024);            while(inChannel.read(buffer) > 0) {                FileChannel outChannel=new FileOutputStream(\"sss1.jpg\",true).getChannel();                outChannel.write(buffer);            }        }        catch(IOException ex) {}    }}\nPlease using this api: FileChannel.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: FileChannel.write\n<<<code>>>: public class FileTest{    public static void main(String[] args)    {           try {            File file = new File(\"sss.jpg\");            FileChannel inChannel=new FileInputStream(file).getChannel();            ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024);            while(inChannel.read(buffer) > 0) {                FileChannel outChannel=new FileOutputStream(\"sss1.jpg\",true).getChannel();                outChannel.write(buffer);            }        }        catch(IOException ex) {}    }}\nExplanation: The issue with the code is that the FileOutputStream is being created with the flag \"true\" which creates a new file if it doesn't exist, but it doesn't truncate the file to zero bytes if it exists. To truncate the file to zero bytes, the flag \"false\" should be used instead. Also, the FileChannel.write method should be used to write the buffer to the file channel of the FileOutputStream."}
