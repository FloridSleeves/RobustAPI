{"api": "StringTokenizer.nextToken", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: StringTokenizer multiple lines: :I have two files, called \"ride.in\" and \"ride.out\". The \"ride.in\" file contains two lines, one containing the string \"COMBO\" and the other line containing the string \"ADEFGA\".  As I said, each string is on separate lines, so \"COMBO\" is on the first line, while \"ADEFGA\" is on the second line in the \"ride.in\" file.Here is my code: public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {File in = new File(\"ride.in\");File out = new File(\"ride.out\");String line;in.createNewFile();out.createNewFile();BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(in));PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(out)));while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {    StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(line);    String sam =st.nextToken();}pw.close();}    }I want to assign COMBO as one token and ADEFGA as another token, but in this code, both COMBO and ADEFGA are assigned to the sam string. How do I assign COMBO to one string, and ADEFGA to another string?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.util.StringTokenizer\n<<<code>>>: StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(line);\n<<<explanation>>>: This code creates a new StringTokenizer object named \"st\" and assigns it the value of the \"line\" variable, which is a string containing the contents of the \"ride.in\" file. The StringTokenizer.nextToken() method is then called to retrieve the next token in the string, which in this case is \"COMBO\"."}
