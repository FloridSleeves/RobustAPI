I know it has to be with createNewFile method but I do not know how to use it. I'd try this in my code:import java.util.*;public class File{public static void main(String args[]){    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);byte option=0;    do{        System.out.println(\"\\nMENU:\\n\");        System.out.println(\"0.-EXIT\");        System.out.println(\"1.-REGISTER USER\");        System.out.println(\"\\nPLEASE ENTER YOUR CHOICE:\");        option = sc.nextByte();    }while(option!=0);}//main}//File\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.io.PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"registeredUser.txt\");\nwriter.write(\"Name: \" + name + \"\\n\");\nwriter.write(\"Email: \" + email + \"\\n\");\nwriter.write(\"Phone: \" + phone + \"\\n\");\nwriter.close();\n\n<<<explanation>>>: To create a txt file in Java, you can use the PrintWriter class to write the contents of the file. In the code above, a new PrintWriter object is created and assigned to the file \"registeredUser.txt\". Then, the write method is used to write the contents of the file, including the user's name, email, and phone number. Finally, the close method is called to close the PrintWriter and ensure that the file is properly closed."}
