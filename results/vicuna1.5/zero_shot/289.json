USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to get the key of a java.util.map from the Value: :I have a map of Map<String, Integer>. I need to sort the values and retrieve the key of the first value after sorting.I did something like this Set<Integer> set = new TreeSet<>(map.values());.Now the values are sorted, How do I get the key of the first element in the sorted values.I will also welcome a better way of achieving this.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.util.Map.get\n<<<code>>>: map.get(Iterator.next())\n<<<explanation>>>: The above code retrieves the key of the first value in the sorted Set<Integer> created from the values of the Map<String, Integer>. The Iterator.next() method is used to get the first element in the sorted Set, which is then passed to the Map.get() method to retrieve the corresponding key. This approach is not recommended as it can lead to ConcurrentModificationException. A better way to achieve this would be to use the sortedMap's keySet() method to get a sorted set of keys and then retrieve the first key using the Iterator.next() method."}
