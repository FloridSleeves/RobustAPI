However, after the last song is played, the loop is not reset, causing the next iteration to start from the last song in the list, resulting in only the last song being played.\n\nTo fix this issue, you can use the `Iterator.next()` method to iterate through the list of songs one by one and play them. Here's the modified code:\n```java\npublic class FX_Musicplayer extends Application {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        launch(args);\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void start(final Stage stage) throws Exception {\n        final ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();\n        try {\n            Statement stmt = null;\n            // connect to database radio\n            Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(\"jdbc:mysql://localhost/radio\", \"root\", \"\");\n            stmt=conn.createStatement();\n            String sql = \"SELECT location FROM Request\";\n            ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(sql);\n            while(rs.next()) {\n                list.add(rs.getString(1));\n            }\n        } catch (SQLException e1) {\n            e1.printStackTrace();\n        }\n        Iterator<String> iterator = list.iterator();\n        while (iterator.hasNext()) {\n            String item = iterator.next();\n            Media media = new Media(item);\n            final MediaPlayer player = new MediaPlayer(media);\n            MediaView view = new MediaView(player);\n            Group root = new Group();\n            root.getChildren().add(view);\n            Scene scene = new Scene(root, 400, 400, Color.BLACK);\n            stage.setScene(scene);\n            stage.show();\n            player.play();\n            player.setOnEndOfMedia(new Runnable() {\n                @Override\n                public void run() {\n                    player.stop();\n                    return;\n                }\n            });\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this modified code, we use the `Iterator.next()` method to iterate through the list of songs one by one and add each song to a `Media` object. We then create a `MediaPlayer` object from the `Media` object and add a `MediaView` object to a `Group` object. We set the `Group` object as the root of the scene and show the scene on the stage. Finally, we call the `play()` method on the `MediaPlayer` object to start playing the song.\n\nNote that we also added a `stop()` method to the `MediaPlayer` object to stop the song from playing when it ends. This is necessary because the `MediaPlayer` object is not automatically stopped when the song ends in JavaFX."}
