USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Efficient way to divide a list into lists of n size: :I have an ArrayList, which I want to divide into smaller List objects of n size, and perform an operation on each.My current method of doing this is implemented with ArrayList objects in Java. Any pseudocode will do.    for (int i = 1; i <= Math.floor((A.size() / n)); i++) {            ArrayList temp = subArray(A, ((i * n) - n),                    (i * n) - 1);            // do stuff with temp        }    private ArrayList<Comparable> subArray(ArrayList A, int start,                int end) {            ArrayList toReturn = new ArrayList();            for (int i = start; i <= end; i++) {                toReturn.add(A.get(i));            }            return toReturn;        }where A is the list and n is the size of the desired listsI believe this way is taking too much time when working with considerably large lists of up to 1 million in size, so I'm trying to figure out what would be more efficient.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: Iterator.next()\n<<<explanation>>>: The Iterator.next() method returns the next element in the iterator. In the given code, it is used to retrieve the next element from the iterator, which is then added to the ArrayList being created for the subarray. This method can be used to iterate through the elements of the ArrayList and create the subarrays efficiently."}
