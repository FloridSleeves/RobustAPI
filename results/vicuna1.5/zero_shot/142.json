Here's an example of how you can do this:\n```scss\nsbc.write(ByteBuffer.wrap(filename.getBytes(\"UTF-8\")));\nsbc.write(buff);\n```\nThis will write the file name to the FileChannel, and then write the file contents to the same channel. The `write()` method of the `FileChannel` class takes a `ByteBuffer` object as an argument, which can be used to write the data to the channel. In this case, we are using `ByteBuffer.wrap()` to wrap the file name and file contents in a `ByteBuffer` object, and then passing that object to the `write()` method. This will ensure that both the file name and file contents are sent together using the same channel."}
