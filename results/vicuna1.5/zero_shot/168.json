(22 answers)                            Closed 3 years ago.I use InputStream to read some data, so I want to read characters until new line or '\\n'. \nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.io.InputStream.read()\n<<<code>>>: int c = inputStream.read();\nwhile (c != -1) {\nif (c == '\\n') {\nbreak;\n}\nc = inputStream.read();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: This code reads a character from the InputStream using the read() method and stores it in the variable c. The loop continues to read characters from the InputStream until either a new line character ('\\n') is encountered or the end of the stream is reached. When a new line character is encountered, the loop is broken using the break statement. The characters are stored in a string variable or used for further processing as needed."}
