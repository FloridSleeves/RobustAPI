USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Taking data from one text file and moving it to a new text file: :I have a file that has data inside of it. In my main method I read in the file and closed the file. I call another method that created a new file inside of the same folder of the original file. So now I have two files, the original file and the file that is being made from the method that I call. I need another method that takes the data from the original file and writes it to the new file that is created. How do I do that?import java.io.*;import java.util.Scanner;import java.util.*;import java.lang.*;public class alice {    public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException {        String filename = (\"/Users/DAndre/Desktop/Alice/wonder1.txt\");        File textFile = new File(filename);        Scanner in = new Scanner(textFile);        in.close();        newFile();    }    public static void newFile() {        final Formatter x;        try {            x = new Formatter(\"/Users/DAndre/Desktop/Alice/new1.text\");            System.out.println(\"you created a new file\");        } catch (Exception e) {            System.out.println(\"Did not work\");        }    }    private static void newData() {    }}\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.io.PrintWriter\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter.write(String)\n<<<explanation>>>: The `PrintWriter.write()` method is used to write a string to a PrintWriter object, which can then be used to write the string to a file. In the given code, the `newFile()` method creates a new file using a `Formatter` object, but it does not write any data to the file. To write data to the file, you can use the `PrintWriter` class and call the `write()` method on it, passing in the data you want to write as a string. For example, you can modify the `newFile()` method to create a `PrintWriter` object and write the data to the file like this:\n```\npublic static void newFile() throws Exception {\n    final Formatter x = new Formatter(\"/Users/DAndre/Desktop/Alice/new1.text\");\n    System.out.println(\"you created a new file\");\n    PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(x);\n    writer.write(\"Data to be written to the new file\");\n    writer.close();\n}\n```\nThis will write the string \"Data to be written to the new file\" to the new file."}
