Maybe I'm going about this the wrong way, but let's see where this question goes :)I would like a Map container that contains either Strings or lists of Strings. I want to enforce this rule during construction of this object so that you can't create a map with values that aren't either of those.e.g.class Record {  public Record(String key, Map<String,Object> attrs) {    // check that attrs only contains Objects which are Strings or List<Strings>  }}Other ways I have thought of to solve the problem might be...1)class Record {  public Record(String key, Map<String,String> attrs, Map<String,List<String>> multiAttrs) {    // ...  }}2)class Record {  public Record(String key, Map<String,Value> attrs) {    // ...  }}class Value {  // Create some funky class that encapsulates lists.  // Perhaps returning the only element in the list if the size is 1,  // but returning the list otherwise}I am not immediately excited at the alternatives, but I'm just putting it there as stuff I've already considered. Really I want the distinction between Strings and List to be transparent to the user of the class.\nPlease using this api: List.get.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.util.List\n<<<code>>>: Map.Entry.getKey()\n<<<explanation>>>: The `Map.Entry.getKey()` method returns the key of a map entry. You can use this method to retrieve the key of a map that contains either Strings or List<String> values. If the map contains a key that is not a String or a List<String>, the method will throw a `ClassCastException`. This can be used to enforce the rule that the values in the map are either Strings or List<String> during the construction of the object."}
