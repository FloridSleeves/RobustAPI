However, you want to write the line without a newline character, so that it appears in the text file as a single line.\n\nTo fix this issue, you can use the `PrintWriter.write()` method instead of `PrintWriter.println()`, which writes the specified string to the output stream without adding a newline character. Here's the modified code:\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class CmdTest {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\n        ProcessBuilder builder = new ProcessBuilder(\"cmd.exe\",\"/c\",\n                \"java -jar C:\\\\Users\\\\hp\\\\Desktop\\\\ckjm-1.99.jar  C:\\\\Users\\\\hp\\\\Desktop\\\\*.class\");\n        builder.redirectErrorStream(true);\n        Process p = builder.start();\n        BufferedReader r = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(\n                p.getInputStream()));\n        String line;\n        while (true) {\n            line = r.readLine();\n            if (line == null) {\n                break;\n            }\n            PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hp\\\\Desktop\\\\result3.txt\", \"UTF-8\");\n            writer.write(line);\n            writer.close();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nWith this modification, the output text file should have the format you specified, without any extra newline characters."}
