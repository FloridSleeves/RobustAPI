USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Inject list of service objects in CDI (Weld): :Let's say I have an interface called SocialNetworkService, and multiple implementations - TwitterService, FacebookService and FriendFeedService, MyService etc.Now I want, whenever my managed bean receives a message, to select one/or more implementations depending on certain rules contained within the message and transmit the message accordingdly.I am not quite sure which would be the best pattern to use?a) Use Interface Instance i.e@Inject @Any Instance<SocialNetworkService> socialNetworkService;SocialNetworkService service = socialNetworkService.get();How would I pass the message to the SocialNetworkServiceFactory ?b) Use Events observe the event in all services (regardless of their interface, which is not exactly what i would like. I.e if i dont support dont transmit...c). i could have annotaded injection i.e@Twitter, @Facebook all in a controller bean and then select the appropriate but my service implementations number will grow....Thanks in advance,Dimitri\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: @Inject @Any Instance<SocialNetworkService> socialNetworkService;\nSocialNetworkService service = socialNetworkService.get();\nIterator<SocialNetworkService> iterator = socialNetworkService.iterator();\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\nSocialNetworkService implementation = iterator.next();\nif (shouldSendMessageTo(message)) {\nimplementation.sendMessage(message);\n}\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: This code uses the Iterator.next() method to iterate through the list of SocialNetworkService implementations and select the appropriate implementation to send the message to. The @Inject annotation is used to inject the list of SocialNetworkService implementations into the bean. The get() method is used to retrieve the first implementation from the list. The iterator is then used to iterate through the list and the hasNext() method is used to check if there are more implementations to iterate through. The next() method is then used to retrieve the next implementation from the list and the sendMessage() method is called on the implementation to send the message. The shouldSendMessageTo() method is used to determine whether the message should be sent to the implementation."}
