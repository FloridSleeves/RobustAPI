USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Using JMeter TCP Sampler is it possible to determine message length using first bytes of the response: :I need some help on identifying the length of the response using the the first byte(s) of the message. Currently using JMeter to send some TCP request but unfortunately it is not able to determine the end of the message, so it hangs. The communication protocol is Google Protobufs (protocol buffers) and does not have an indicator to determine the end of message. Below is what Jmeter has.  I would appreciate if someone can tell me how I can build on top of this so I can measure the length of the message using the first bytes of the response. JMETER - Read method.public String read(InputStream is) throws ReadException {    ByteArrayOutputStream w = new ByteArrayOutputStream();    try {        byte[] buffer = new byte[127];        int x = 0;        while ((x = is.read(buffer)) > -1) {            w.write(buffer, 0, x);            if (useEolByte && (buffer[x - 1] == eolByte)) {                break;            }                }        IOUtils.closeQuietly(w); // For completeness        final String hexString = JOrphanUtils.baToHexString(w.toByteArray());        if(log.isDebugEnabled()) {            log.debug(\"Read: \" + w.size() + \"\\n\" + hexString);        }        return hexString;    } catch (IOException e) {            throw new ReadException(\"\", e, JOrphanUtils.baToHexString(w.toByteArray()));    }}\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "InputStream.read() method reads a single byte from the input stream and returns it as an integer. To determine the length of the message using the first bytes of the response, you can use the following approach:\n\n1. Read the first byte from the input stream using InputStream.read() method.\n2. If the first byte is not the end of message indicator, read the next byte and check if it matches the end of message indicator.\n3. Repeat step 2 until you reach the end of the message or encounter an error.\n4. Once you have read all the bytes of the message, you can calculate the length of the message by adding up the number of bytes read in steps 1-3.\n\nHere's an example code snippet that demonstrates this approach:\n```java\nInputStream is = ...; // Input stream to read from\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[127];\nint x = 0;\nint messageLength = 0;\n\nwhile ((x = is.read(buffer)) > -1) {\n    if (buffer[x - 1] == // End of message indicator\n```"}
