The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to tokenize a set of lines from a given input?: :I'm trying something pretty simple.I have to read the following input line by line and create an ArrayList of Integers for every line.2 5 103 5 15I'm trying to process it using the following codewhile((newLine=f.readLine()) != null){    for(int k=0; k<newLine.length(); k++){        StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(newLine);        int i1 = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());         System.out.println(\"Adding to list\"+i1);        input.add(i1);    }}As you can see, I'm reinitializing st to newLine each time, instead of moving onto the next token. Any thoughts on how I can achieve what I am intending to?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(newLine);\nwhile (st.hasMoreTokens()) {\nint i1 = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\ninput.add(i1);\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The issue with the original code is that it is reinitializing the StringTokenizer object st to newLine each time, instead of moving onto the next token. To fix this, you can use the hasMoreTokens() method to check if there are more tokens to be read, and then use the nextToken() method to read the next token. This way, you can avoid reinitializing the StringTokenizer object and read all the tokens in the line."}
