The problem is , the visual effect is seems to be different. The google one has the action bar retain when the drawer is open while the facebook one does not.Instead, the whole screen has pushed to right side I have found there are some lib can achieve this, but since I prefer not include third party lib in the project, are there any way to achieve this ?

The `setupMenu` method is being called to set up the menu items and the adapter that will display them in the navigation drawer. The `ListView` object `menu` is being used to display the menu items. The `onItemClick` method is being used to handle when a menu item is clicked, and it is passing the selected item's text to a new fragment. The `DrawerLayout` object `drawer` is being used to create the navigation drawer, and the `SimpleDrawerListener` object is being used to handle when the drawer is closed. The `FragmentTransaction` object `tx` is being used to replace the content of the main container with the new fragment when the drawer is closed."}
