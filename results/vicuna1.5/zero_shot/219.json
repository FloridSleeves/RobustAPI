Though the program appears to work, the files seem to be corrupted in the copying process, and when I try to play them from bash, I get an error that reads \"play FAIL formats: can't open input file `79_97_729.wav': WAVE: RIFF header not found\".My copy method is as follows:public void copyFile(File file, String newName) throws JSchException, IOException{    String prefix = null;    if (new File(destination).isDirectory()){        prefix = destination + File.separator;    }    JSch jsch = new JSch();    Session session = jsch.getSession(\"username\", \"network\");    session.setUserInfo(new MyUserInfo());    session.connect();    String command = \"scp -f \" + file.getAbsolutePath();    Channel channel = session.openChannel(\"exec\");    ((ChannelExec)channel).setCommand(command);    OutputStream out = channel.getOutputStream();    InputStream in = channel.getInputStream();    channel.connect();    byte[] buf = new byte[1024];    // send '\\0'    buf[0]=0; out.write(buf, 0, 1); out.flush();    while(true){        int c=checkAck(in);        if(c!='C'){            break;        }        // read '0644 '        in.read(buf, 0, 5);        long filesize=0L;        while(true){            if(in.read(buf, 0, 1)<0){                // error                break;            }            if(buf[0]==' ')break;            filesize=filesize*10L+(long)(buf[0]-'0');        }        // send '\\0'        buf[0]=0; out.write(buf, 0, 1); out.flush();        // read a content of lfile        fos=new FileOutputStream(prefix == null ? destination : prefix + newName);        int foo;        while(true){            if(buf.length<filesize) foo=buf.length;            else foo=(int)filesize;            foo=in.read(buf, 0, foo);            if(foo<0){                // error                break;            }            fos.write(buf, 0, foo);            filesize-=foo;            if(filesize==0L) break;        }        fos.close();        fos=null;        // send '\\0'        buf[0]=0; out.write(buf, 0, 1); out.flush();    }    session.disconnect();}Is there some sort of adaptation I can do to control for the fact that the files I am copying are in wav format?  Any help would be appreciated!\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.io.InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: file.read(buf, 0, filesize);\n<<<explanation>>>: The code is reading the contents of the file in chunks and writing it to the output stream. The `read()` method of the InputStream is used to read a specified number of bytes from the input stream and store them in a byte array. In this case, the method is reading the contents of the file in chunks until the end of the file is reached or an error occurs. The `filesize` variable is used to keep track of the number of bytes read from the file, and the `buf` array is used to store the read bytes. The code should be modified to read the WAV file header first and then copy the data accordingly."}
