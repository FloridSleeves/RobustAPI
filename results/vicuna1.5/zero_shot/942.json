{"api": "String.getBytes", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Downloading a file from spring controllers: :I have a requirement where I need to download a PDF from the website. The PDF needs to be generated within the code, which I thought would be a combination of freemarker and a PDF generation framework like iText. Any better way? However, my main problem is how do I allow the user to download a file through a Spring Controller?\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: String.getBytes()\n<<<code>>>:\nresponse.setContentType(\"application/pdf\");\nresponse.setHeader(\"Content-Disposition\", \"attachment; filename=filename.pdf\");\nOutputStream outputStream = response.getOutputStream();\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\nint bytesRead = -1;\nwhile ((bytesRead = inputStream.read(buffer)) != -1) {\noutputStream.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);\n}\noutputStream.flush();\noutputStream.close();\nresponse.sendRedirect(servletContext.getContextPath() + \"/download\");\n\n<<<explanation>>>:\nThis code snippet allows the user to download a PDF file from a Spring Controller by generating the PDF content in memory and setting the content type and content disposition headers of the response object to simulate a file download. The PDF content is read from an input stream and written to the output stream of the response object. Finally, the response object is redirected to the download URL, which is the context path of the Spring application."}
