USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: TCP Server-Client large json: :I currently have a TCP server (java desktop application) and client (android application) connected.I can send json string from client to server and from server to client, my issue is sometimes i need to send from the server a large string which gets cut.This is my code:SERVER SIDE public void sendResponse(String response){  PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(BufferedWriter(                       new OutputStreamWriter(mClientSocket.getOutputStream())), true);  if(writer != null && !writer.checkError()){     writer.println(response);     writer.flush();  }}CLIENT SIDEBufferedReader input = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(mSocket.getInputStream()));String response;while((response = input.readLine()) != null && mRun){    Data data = new Gson().fromJson(response, Data.class);    //when i try to convert the response to Data object using Gson    //it gives me a com.google.gson.JsonSyntaxException: com.google.gson.stream.MalformedJsonException: Unterminated array at line 1 column 106498}as you can see the error on client side happens because the string was to large so it got cut off, can someone please tell me what to do in this case?thanks in advance.\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: DataOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>: DataOutputStream.write(response)\n<<<explanation>>>: To prevent the large string from being cut off, you can use the DataOutputStream.write method to write the response to the server. This method allows you to write binary data, which can be larger than the maximum size of a JSON string. By using this method, you can ensure that the entire response is sent to the server, even if it exceeds the maximum size of a JSON string."}
