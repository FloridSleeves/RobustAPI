USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to have List Iterator start at a given index?: :I have a linked list and I need to make method that returns an iterator at a given point in the list. I currently have an iterator that starts at the head:public Iterator<E> iterator( ){    return new ListIterator();}All I have for the other one is:public Iterator<E> iterator(int x ){    return new ListIterator();}I'm not sure how to go about utilizing the given position(x) that won't affect my ListIterator constructor which starts at head. I tried using a for loop to get to \"x\" but realized that wouldn't tell the iterator to start there, so I'm quite stumped. Edit:public ListIterator()        {            current = head; // head in the enclosing list        }\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: Iterator<E> iterator = list.iterator();\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\nint x = iterator.next().intValue();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: To have the List Iterator start at a given index, you can use the Iterator.next() method to move the iterator to the desired position in the list. In this case, you can use a while loop and the hasNext() method to check if the iterator has more elements to iterate through, and then use the next() method to move the iterator to the desired position in the list. Once you have reached the desired position, you can access the value of the element at that position using the intValue() method."}
