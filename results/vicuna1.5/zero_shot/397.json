{"api": "Iterator.next", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: convert comma (with a space) delimited string into columns under the matching values from the string itself: :I have an output in the console from my code like the sample given below,... columns=20xs, viewport_supported=true, wta=false, ..., mmf=false... columns=11xs, viewport_supported=false, wta=false, ..., mmf=true ... columns=15xs, viewport_supported=true, wta=false, ..., mmf=falseI want to re-arrange it by extracting the common string left to the '=' sign and put it as the column header and its values in its column. How to start doing this in Java?I am looking for the output like below:columns      viewport_supported        wta     and so on  20xs              true              false  11xs              false             false  15xs              true              false\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: String[] columns = inputString.split(\",\\\\s*\");\nIterator<String> iterator = columns.iterator();\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\nString column = iterator.next();\nString[] values = column.split(\"=\");\ncolumns[iterator.nextIndex()] = values[0];\niterator.remove();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>:\nThis code uses the `split()` method to split the input string into an array of strings, with each comma and optional whitespace separated values. Then, it uses an iterator to iterate through the array and extract the common string left to the '=' sign and put it as the column header and its values in its column. Finally, it removes the extracted column and its values from the array."}
