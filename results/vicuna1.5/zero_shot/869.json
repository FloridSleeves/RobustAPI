USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Update data to file each amount of bytes: :I want to write my content data to a file each 10kb of file. It looks like this: What I tried: FileInputStream is; FileOutputStream out; File input = new File(filePath); int fileLength = input.length(); int len = 0;    while (len < fileLength){        len += is.read(buff);        // write my data        out.write(data, 0, data.length);       // how to move is to read next 10kb???    }I wonder is there anyway to move the cursor reader to next amount of bytes? Or do I miss anything?Update:Thank to @DThought, here is my implementation:    File input = new File(filePath);    long fileLength = input.length();    byte[] data;    byte[] buff = new byte[data.length];    long JUMP_LENGTH = 10 * 1024;    RandomAccessFile raf = new RandomAccessFile(input, \"rw\");    long step = JUMP_LENGTH + data.length;    for (long i = 0; i < fileLength; i += step) {        // read to buffer        raf.seek(i);        raf.read(buff);        raf.seek(i); // make sure it move to correct place after reading        raf.write(data);    }    raf.close();And it worked well.\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: RandomAccessFile.write\n<<<code>>>: RandomAccessFile raf = new RandomAccessFile(input, \"rw\");\nlong step = JUMP_LENGTH + data.length;\nfor (long i = 0; i < fileLength; i += step) {\nraf.seek(i);\nraf.write(data);\nraf.seek(i + JUMP_LENGTH);\n}\nraf.close();\n\nExplanation:\nTo write the data to the file in chunks of 10KB, you can use the RandomAccessFile.write method and seek to the correct position before writing. In this code, a RandomAccessFile is created with the input file as the file object and \"rw\" as the mode. Then, a variable \"step\" is defined, which is the number of bytes to read and write in each iteration. The loop iterates through the file, seeking to the current position plus the step size before writing the data. This ensures that the data is written in chunks of 10KB. Finally, the RandomAccessFile is closed."}
