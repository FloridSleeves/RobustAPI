The OrientDB contains one unique node with the property \"SPECIAL-NODE\". I want to query the database for this node and print it out. I have one line of code that works using an iterator (see below) and one that does not (below at bottom). It seems like both should work yet only the first does, the second does not. Why is this the case?Thanks!// create Orient graph object and connect to database, works successfullyOrientGraph ograph = new OrientGraph(\"remote:localhost/test\", \"username\", \"password\");// this WORKS - finds the one special node and prints it outIterator<Vertex> i =ograph.getVertices(\"SPECIAL-NODE\", \"SPECIAL\").iterator();System.out.println(i.next());// this DOES NOT WORK. WHY???System.out.println(\"SPECIAL NODE: \" + ograph.getVertexByKey(\"SPECIAL-NODE\",   \"SPECIAL\"));\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: System.out.println(i.next());\n<<<explanation>>>: The reason why the second code block does not work is that the `Iterator.next()` method returns the next element in the iterator, but it does not remove it from the iterator. This means that if you call `Iterator.next()` multiple times, you will get the same vertex multiple times, and the iterator will never be empty. In the first code block, the `Iterator.next()` method is called once, and then the iterator is removed from the graph using `i.remove()`. This ensures that the iterator is empty after the first call to `Iterator.next()`, so the second call to `Iterator.next()` will return a new vertex."}
