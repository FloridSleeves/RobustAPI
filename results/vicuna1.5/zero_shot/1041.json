The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Spring request mapping catching part of uri to PathVariable: :I need something similar to enter link description hereSo my path would be: /something/else/and/some/moreI would like to map it like so:@RequestMapping(value=\"/something/**\", method=RequestMethod.GET)public String handleRequest(String theRestOfPath){ /***/ }Or@RequestMapping(value=\"/something/**\", method=RequestMethod.GET)public String handleRequest(String[] theRestOfPathArr){ /***/ }The thing is ... I would like everything matched by ** to be passed to the method either:1. as a string (theRestOfPath = \"/else/and/some/more\"),2. or as an array (theRestOfPathArr = [\"else\",\"and\",\"some\",\"more\"]).  The number of path variables can vary, so I can't do:@RequestMapping(value=\"/something/{a}/{b}/{c}\", method=RequestMethod.GET)public String handleRequest(String a, String b, String c){ /***/ }Is there a way to do that?Thanks :)  ---EDIT---The solution I ended up with:  @RequestMapping(value = \"/something/**\", method = RequestMethod.GET)@ResponseBodypublic TextStory getSomething(HttpServletRequest request) {    final String URI_PATTERN = \"^.*/something(/.+?)(\\\\.json|\\\\.xml)?$\";    String uri = request.getRequestURI().replaceAll(URI_PATTERN, \"$1\");    return doSomethingWithStuff(uri);}\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(request.getRequestURI());\nst.nextToken();\nString uri = st.nextToken();\nreturn doSomethingWithStuff(uri);\n<<<explanation>>>: This code uses the StringTokenizer class to extract the portion of the request URI that matches the pattern \"/something/**\". The nextToken() method is called twice to remove the leading \"/\" and the trailing \".json\" or \".xml\" from the URI. The resulting string is then passed to the doSomethingWithStuff() method."}
