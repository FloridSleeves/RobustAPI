USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: What is the best way to use a single instance of SQLiteOpenHelper among two different activities?: :I'm coding for the first time in Android (Java) an application using a sqlite database. Two activities must save some informations so I use in both a MySQLiteHelper to access the database.I read here that building SQLiteOpenHelper as static data member could be a good practice so I did this. The static factory method ensures that there exists only one DatabaseHelper instance at any time.I create in each activity a SQLiteOpenHelper that uses the method getWritableDatabase() but I don't know where to use the close() method. Should I put this method after every modification or once at the end of the activity ? Thank you =)\nPlease using this api: SQLiteDatabase.query.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: SQLiteDatabase.query()\n<<<code>>>:\n```java\n// In the first activity\nSQLiteDatabase db = getWritableDatabase();\nCursor cursor = db.query(TABLE_NAME, null, null, null, null, null, null);\n\n// In the second activity\nSQLiteDatabase db = getWritableDatabase();\nCursor cursor = db.query(TABLE_NAME, null, null, null, null, null, null);\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: It is generally a good practice to close the SQLiteDatabase object when you are done using it. You can call the close() method on the SQLiteDatabase object to close it. It is recommended to call the close() method once at the end of the activity, rather than after every modification. This will ensure that the database is properly closed and resources are freed when they are no longer needed."}
