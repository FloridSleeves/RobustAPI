The entered file name is then stored in the inputFile variable. A StringTokenizer object is then created and used to read the command and info values from the input file. The nextToken() method of the StringTokenizer object is used to read the next token (i.e., the command or info value) from the input file and store it in the command variable. The nextToken() method is then called again to read the next token and store it in the info variable. The command and info variables will contain the String values read from the input file."}
