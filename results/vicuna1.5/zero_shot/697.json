File displayed with all options can you suggest how to make the temp file as not modified and even it is not able to save to another location. I need this file only displayed at run time of the program. During that time user does not change any content and it could not be save as  another location.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: org.springframework.core.io.Resource\n<<<code>>>: resource.getInputStream()\n<<<explanation>>>: Instead of using the getInputStream() method to read the file, you can use the getReader() method to create a BufferedReader object, which will allow you to read the file line by line. Then, you can use the PrintWriter.write() method to write each line to a StringBuilder object, which can be returned as the result of the getText() method. This way, the temp file will be created and displayed at run time, but it will not be modified and cannot be saved as another location."}
