{"api": "StringTokenizer.nextToken", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Android Split string: :I have  a string called CurrentString and is in the form of something like this\"Fruit: they taste good\". I would like to split up the CurrentString using the : as the delimiter.So that way the word \"Fruit\" will be split into its own string and \"they taste good\" will be another string.And then i would simply like to use SetText() of 2 different TextViews to display that string. What would be the best way to approach this? \nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(CurrentString, \":\");\nst.nextToken();\nString fruit = st.nextToken();\nString taste = st.nextToken();\n<<<explanation>>>: To split the CurrentString using the \":\" delimiter, you can use the StringTokenizer class in Java. First, create a StringTokenizer object with the CurrentString as the first argument and the delimiter \":\" as the second argument. Then, call the nextToken() method twice to get the next token (i.e., \"Fruit\") and the next token (i.e., \"they taste good\"). Finally, you can use the SetText() method of two different TextViews to display the two strings."}
