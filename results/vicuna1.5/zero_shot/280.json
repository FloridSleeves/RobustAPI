USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java 8 Stream, getting head and tail: :Java 8 introduced a Stream class that resembles Scala's Stream, a powerful lazy construct using which it is possible to do something like this very concisely:def from(n: Int): Stream[Int] = n #:: from(n+1)def sieve(s: Stream[Int]): Stream[Int] = {  s.head #:: sieve(s.tail filter (_ % s.head != 0))}val primes = sieve(from(2))primes takeWhile(_ < 1000) print  // prints all primes less than 1000I wondered if it is possible to do this in Java 8, so I wrote something like this:IntStream from(int n) {    return IntStream.iterate(n, m -> m + 1);}IntStream sieve(IntStream s) {    int head = s.findFirst().getAsInt();    return IntStream.concat(IntStream.of(head), sieve(s.skip(1).filter(n -> n % head != 0)));}IntStream primes = sieve(from(2));Fairly simple, but it produces java.lang.IllegalStateException: stream has already been operated upon or closed because both findFirst() and skip() are terminal operations on Stream which can be done only once.I don't really have to use up the stream twice since all I need is the first number in the stream and the rest as another stream, i.e. equivalent of Scala's Stream.head and Stream.tail. Is there a method in Java 8 Stream that I can use to achieve this?Thanks.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: IntStream.iterate(2, n -> n + 1).flatMap(sieve(n))\n<<<explanation>>>: The `Iterate` method in Java 8 allows you to create an iterator from an initial value and a function that updates the iterator's state. In this case, we use `IntStream.iterate(2, n -> n + 1)` to create an iterator that starts at 2 and increments by 1 on each iteration. We then use the `flatMap` method to apply the `sieve` function to each element in the iterator, creating a new stream of primes. The `sieve` function is called recursively with the `skip` method to avoid the `IllegalStateException` caused by using `findFirst` and `skip` on the same stream."}
