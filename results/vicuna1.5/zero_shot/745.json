USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Modify contents of text file and write to new file in java: :So I've got the basic code for this however due to the while loop I'm using, I can really only write the last line of the text file to the new file. I'm trying to modify the text from testfile.txt and write it to a new file named mdemarco.txt. The modification I'm trying to do is add a line number in front of each line. Does anybody know a way to maybe write the contents of the while loop to a string while it runs and output the resulting string to mdemarco.txt or anything like that?public class Writefile{public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException{  try  {     Scanner file = new Scanner(new File(\"testfile.txt\"));     File output = new File(\"mdemarco.txt\");     String s = \"\";     String b = \"\";     int n = 0;     while(file.hasNext())     {        s = file.nextLine();        n++;        System.out.println(n+\". \"+s);        b = (n+\". \"+s);     }//end while     PrintWriter printer = new PrintWriter(output);     printer.println(b);     printer.close();  }//end try     catch(FileNotFoundException fnfe)  {     System.out.println(\"Was not able to locate testfile.txt.\");  }}//end main}//end classThe input file text is:doremefa solatedoAnd the output I'm getting is only8. doCan anybody help?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.io.PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter printer = new PrintWriter(output); printer.println(b); printer.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: This code creates a PrintWriter object and uses it to write the contents of the variable \"b\" to the file \"mdemarco.txt\". The PrintWriter class is used to write text to a file, and the close() method is used to close the writer and flush any remaining output to the file. By using the println() method, the entire contents of the variable \"b\" will be written to the file in a single line."}
