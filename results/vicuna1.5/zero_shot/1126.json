The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java: :I have a problem with matrix. I have a matrix in txt file. This matrix looks:231 324 123345 565 234657 234 654I want to replacement elements to form:654 234 657234 565 345231 324 123I have a algorithm with replacement elements: 3-1-i, where i is number of choosen element from array. I have a problem how I read file and save elements to array and how implement this loop. This is my try with reading txt file and saving elements to array:    List<String[]> rows = new ArrayList<String[]>();    while ((line = bfr.readLine()) != null) {        String[] row = line.split(\" \");         rows.add(row);       }    System.out.println(rows.toString());  But I get [Ljava.lang.String;@525483cd as result. Can anyone help me with this loop and reading this matrix?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(line);\nst.nextToken();\nString element = st.nextToken();\nrows.add(element);\n\nExplanation:\nTo read the matrix from the txt file, you can use the StringTokenizer class to split the line into individual elements. The nextToken() method is used to get the first element in the line, and then the nextToken() method is used to get each subsequent element in the line. The elements are added to the rows list using the add() method.\n\nNote that the split() method is used to split the line into an array of strings, but the StringTokenizer class is used to split the line into individual elements. The split() method is more efficient for splitting a string into an array of strings, but the StringTokenizer class is more flexible and can be used to split a string into any number of different types of elements."}
