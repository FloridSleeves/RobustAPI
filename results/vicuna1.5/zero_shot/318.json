Player can use mouse to move spaceship and every 200ms new beam is shoot. This beam is moved in while(true) loop and when its y is 0 or 400 (bounds of frame) i use break to end the loop (and thread). Every beam has its own thread. There are also stars which move in background. Every of them moves like beams and has its own thread. So as you can see there are often add and removes from arrayLists. Everything works but from time to time I get such errors:Exception in thread \"AWT-EventQueue-0\" java.util.ConcurrentModificationException    at java.util.ArrayList$Itr.checkForComodification(ArrayList.java:819)    at java.util.ArrayList$Itr.next(ArrayList.java:791)    at spacecommander.MainPanel.paintComponent(MainPanel.java:50)They doesnt make any problems in game but how can I eliminate them? Maybe I should use synchronization or something?EDIT: HERE IS THE CODEpublic class MainPanel extends JPanel {    private Player player = new Player(100, 100, 3, 3);    private Point2D targetPoint = new Point2D.Float(130, 350); //Poczatkowa pozycja statku    private ArrayList<Beam> beams = new ArrayList<Beam>();    private InputMap imap = getInputMap(JComponent.WHEN_IN_FOCUSED_WINDOW);    private ActionMap amap = getActionMap();    private Random rand = new Random();    public MainPanel() {        setPreferredSize(new Dimension(300, 400));        addMouseMotionListener(new MouseMotionHandler());        //Rozpoczynanie watkow        Thread t = new Thread(new PlayerMoveRunnable());        t.start();        Thread t2 = new Thread(new PlayerShootRunnable());        t2.start();    }    public void paintComponent(Graphics g) {        Graphics2D g2 = (Graphics2D)g;        g2.setColor(Color.BLACK);        g2.fillRect(0, 0, 300, 400);        //Rysowanie gracza        g2.drawImage(player.getImage(), (int)player.getX(), (int)player.getY(), null);        //Rysowanie pociskow        for (Beam beam : beams) {            g2.drawImage(beam.getImage(), (int)beam.getX(), (int)beam.getY(), null);        }    }    public void makeShortcut(String name, String keys, AbstractAction action) {        imap.put(KeyStroke.getKeyStroke(keys), name);        amap.put(name, action);    }    //Watek dziala caly czas bo gracz i tak caly czas sie rusza    private class PlayerMoveRunnable implements Runnable {        public void run() {            try {                while (true) {                    player.moveToPoint(targetPoint);                    repaint();                    Thread.sleep(15);                }            } catch (InterruptedException e) {                e.printStackTrace();            }        }    }    //Takze dziala caly czas.

This means that the collection has been modified while the iterator was in use, and the iterator is no longer valid.\n\nIn this case, the error is likely occurring in the \"BeamMoveRunnable\" class, specifically in the line \"beams.add(beam);\". This line adds the beam to the \"beams\" ArrayList while the iterator is still in use. To fix this, you can use the \"synchronized\" keyword to ensure that only one thread can access the ArrayList at a time.\n\nHere is an example of how you can modify the \"BeamMoveRunnable\" class to use synchronized:\n```\nprivate class BeamMoveRunnable implements Runnable {\n    private Beam beam;\n    public BeamMoveRunnable(Beam beam) {\n        this.beam = beam;\n    }\n    public void run() {\n        synchronized (beams) {\n            beams.add(beam);\n        }\n        try {\n            while (true) {\n                if (beam.getY() <= 0) {\n                    synchronized (beams) {\n                        beams.remove(beam);\n                    }\n                    break;\n                }\n                beam.move();\n                repaint();\n                Thread.sleep(20);\n            }\n        } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis way, the synchronized block ensures that only one thread can access the ArrayList at a time, preventing the \"ConcurrentModificationException\" error from occurring."}
