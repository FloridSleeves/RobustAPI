I am trying to read the tableLists map and get the first and second value from the map.Below is the code I have in which ReadTableConnectionInfo is the class.private final LinkedHashMap<String, ReadTableConnectionInfo> tableLists;ReadTableConnectionInfo table = tablePicker();private ReadTableConnectionInfo tablePicker() {    Random r = new SecureRandom();    ReadTableConnectionInfo table;    if (r.nextFloat() < Read.percentageTable / 100) {        table = get first value from tableLists map    } else {        table = get second value from tableLists map    }    return table;}\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.util.Iterator.next()\n<<<code>>>: tableLists.iterator().next().getFirstValue();\n<<<explanation>>>: To retrieve the first value from the map, you can use the iterator of the LinkedHashMap and call the \"next\" method on it to get the first key-value pair. Then, you can retrieve the first value of that pair using the \"get\" method. To retrieve the second value, you can call the \"next\" method again to get the next key-value pair and retrieve the second value of that pair."}
