USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I get an exclusive tailset of a SortedSet?: :I want to get an exclusive tail set of a SortedSet.  The shortest method I can come up with is:private void exclusiveTailSet(SortedSet<String> s, String start) {    System.out.println(s); // [Five, Four, One, Six, Start, Three, Two]    SortedSet<String> t = s.tailSet(start);    System.out.println(t); // [Start, Three, Two]    Iterator<String> i = t.iterator();    i.next();    SortedSet<String> u = t.tailSet(i.next());    System.out.println(u); // [Three, Two]}The javadoc for tailSet suggests asking for the subset starting from the next element in the domain (i.e. for Strings calling s.tailSet(start+\"\\0\");), however I'm actually working with objects such that it would be much more of an overhead to create it.What is an efficient and clean general method to create an exclusive tail set?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.util.Iterator\n<<<code>>>: Iterator<T> iterator = mySortedSet.iterator();\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\nString nextElement = iterator.next();\nif (nextElement.equals(start)) {\nbreak;\n}\n}\nreturn iterator;\n<<<explanation>>>: This code creates an iterator for the SortedSet and then uses a while loop to iterate through the elements of the SortedSet. If the current element is equal to the start element, the loop is broken and the iterator is returned. This creates an exclusive tail set of the SortedSet, starting from the next element after the start element. The Iterator.next() method is used to retrieve the next element in the SortedSet."}
