Also, you need to check if the character before '\u00d0' and '\u00cf' is '\u00d0' or '\u00cf' instead of checking if it is '\u00d0' or '\u00cf'.\n\nHere's the modified code that should work:\n\n<<<api>>>: DataOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>: dos.write(c);\n<<<explanation>>>: This code writes the character 'c' to the file.\n\nQuestion: How to write the modified file using the given API: DataOutputStream.write: :I have a .doc file with contains header before the \u00d0\u00cf , So I need to remove all the characters that are exist before the \u00d0\u00cf.Example :  asdfasdfasdfasfasdfasf\u00d0\u00cf9asjdfkjI have used the below code.InputStream is = new   FileInputStream(\"D:\\\\Users\\\\Vinoth\\\\workspace\\\\Testing\\\\Testing_2.doc\");    DataInputStream dis = new DataInputStream(is);    OutputStream os = new  FileOutputStream(\"D:\\\\Users\\\\Vinoth\\\\workspace\\\\Testing\\\\Testing_3.doc\");    DataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(os);    byte[] buff = new byte[dis.available()];    dis.readFully(buff);    char temp = 0;    boolean start = false;    try{    for(byte b:buff){        char c = (char)b;        if(temp == '\u00d0' && c == '\u00cf' ){            start = true;          }        if(start){            dos.write(c);        }        temp = c;    }However , it is not writing anything in my file as the first if condition is not getting satisfied.
