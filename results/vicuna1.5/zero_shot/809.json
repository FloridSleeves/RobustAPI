The suggested values should come from ldap. I should use JQuery for this, but so far that's all I know.

It then populates a JComboBox with the autocomplete suggestions and adds an event listener to the JComboBox to populate the JTextField. Finally, it adds the JComboBox and JTextField to a Spring 3 form using a JPanel.\n\nNote that you will need to replace the LDAP server details, LDAP user, and LDAP password with the appropriate values for your LDAP server. Additionally, you may need to modify the code to handle errors and exceptions that may occur during the LDAP search."}
