USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Invoking method with a parameter of the value of a different variable type: :I have a bunch of variables declared as 2D arrays:int[][] array1 = {{}};int[][] array2 = {{}};etc..I'm currently using a method to invoke another method with one of the variables as a parameter with a switch:public void invokeMethod(){switch(variableNumber){    case 1: method(piece1);    break;    case 2: method(piece2);    break;    etc..  }}This feels like a phenomenally stupid way of approaching this issue, is there a more clever solution? Perhaps storing the variables in an array? What I'd like to do, in case I'm faced with thousands of 2D arrays, is invoking the method with the value of a variable of a different data type, like this:String arrayToBeInvokedWith = \"array1\";method(arrayToBeInvokedWith){}(Yes, I do know this is too simplistic, but you can get the idea from it)Is there a similar solution? Any feedback is much appreciated.EDIT: All of the arrays have a same size.\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Map.get()\n<<<code>>>: Map.get(variableNumber)\n<<<explanation>>>: Instead of using a switch statement to invoke the method with a specific variable, you can use the Map.get() method to retrieve the value of the variableNumber and pass it as an argument to the method. This way, you can avoid the switch statement and make the code more concise.\n\nFor example:\n```\npublic void invokeMethod(int variableNumber) {\n    method(Map.get(variableNumber));\n}\n```\nThis way you can use the method like this:\n```\ninvokeMethod(1);\ninvokeMethod(2);\n```\nIt's important to note that the variableNumber must be of type int and have the same size as the arrays."}
