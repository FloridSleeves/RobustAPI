When I do I get: org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchWindoException: Unable to loacate window\"{accb1cc2-74c9-3b4e-8f71-c0b184a037c4}\"; duration or timeout: Here is the java:driver = new FirefoxDriver();driver.get(\"http://mail.google.com\");String firstWindowHandle = driver.getWindowHandle();System.out.println(\"handle of first window =\"+firstWindowHandle);Thread.sleep(1000);driver = new FirefoxDriver();driver.get(\"http://www.google.com\");// Get names of currently open windowsString secondWindowHandle = driver.getWindowHandle();System.out.println(\"handle of first window =\"+secondWindowHandle);Thread.sleep(1000);// It fails right here!driver.switchTo().window(firstWindowHandle );driver.get(\"http://www.lifehacker.com\");It prints the following to the console:- handle of first window = {accb1cc2-74c9-3b4e-8f71-c0b184a037c4}- handle of the second window = {f5256619-a36e-a441-9979-937da0abacd1}All help is appreciated.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "The issue you are facing is due to the fact that the `driver.getWindowHandle()` method returns a handle for the current window, not the handle for the next window. To switch to the next window, you need to use the `driver.switchTo().window(secondWindowHandle)` method, where `secondWindowHandle` is the handle for the next window.\n\nHere's the updated code:\n```java\nIterator<String> windowHandles = driver.getWindowHandles();\nwhile (windowHandles.hasNext()) {\n    String windowHandle = windowHandles.next();\n    System.out.println(\"handle of window = \" + windowHandle);\n    if (windowHandle.equals(firstWindowHandle)) {\n        driver.switchTo().window(secondWindowHandle);\n        driver.get(\"http://www.lifehacker.com\");\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code uses an iterator to get the handles of all the windows that are currently open, and then checks if the current window handle matches the first window handle. If it does, it switches to the second window using the `driver.switchTo().window()` method and then navigates to the desired URL."}
