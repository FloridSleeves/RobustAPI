USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: will it overlap ? Timer-task VS handler VS alarm-manager: :I'm trying to build an Android app which will repeatedly run some process every 10 mins.As I found out Handlers are more reliable than timers or scheduling. So I'm going to develop my app using the Handlers using the given below codes.I'm little bit concerned that the below codes will create separate Handlers at each time I start the app and keep them running parallel, may be since I'm creating the Handler on onCreate.So what is the best way to keep only a single Handler runs in background at a time? private Handler handler;@Overrideprotected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);    handler = new Handler(); // new handler    handler.postDelayed(runnable, 1000*60*10); // 10 mins int.    setContentView(R.layout.activity_pro__sms);} private Runnable runnable = new Runnable() {    @Override    public void run() {        /* my set of codes for repeated work */        foobar();        handler.postDelayed(this, 1000*60*10); // reschedule the handler    }};\nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "The given code creates a new Handler in the `onCreate()` method of an Activity and posts a Runnable object to it after a delay of 10 minutes. The Runnable object contains the code for the repeated work. However, it is possible that multiple instances of the Activity may be created, each with its own Handler, if the app is restarted or if the user navigates away and then returns to the app. To ensure that only a single Handler runs in the background at a time, you should move the Handler and Runnable code to a separate class or service, and use a single instance of this class or service to handle the repeated work. You can then use the `AlarmManager` and `PendingIntent` to schedule the work to be done at regular intervals, rather than relying on the `Handler` to post a delay."}
