USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: ConcurrentModificationException in iterator.next(): :I have next code in background threadprivate List<IStartAction> mActions = Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList<IStartAction>()); protected void removeNonApplicableActions() {        Iterator<IStartAction> iterator = mActions.iterator();        while (iterator.hasNext()) {            IStartAction action = iterator.next();            if (!action.isApplicable()) {                iterator.remove();            }        }    }When i run this in main thread got ConcurrentModificationException into iterator.next().Why is this happening? I use thread-safe collection and remove items through iterator. Collection used in only this thread.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "The `ConcurrentModificationException` is being thrown because the `Iterator` is being modified while it is being iterated over. This is happening because the `removeNonApplicableActions()` method is modifying the `mActions` list while the iterator is iterating over it.\n\nTo fix this issue, you can use the `Iterator.remove()` method instead of calling `iterator.remove()` directly. This will ensure that the iterator is not modified while it is being iterated over.\n\nHere is the updated code:\n```\nprivate List<IStartAction> mActions = Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList<IStartAction>());\n\nprotected void removeNonApplicableActions() {\n    Iterator<IStartAction> iterator = mActions.iterator();\n    while (iterator.hasNext()) {\n        IStartAction action = iterator.next();\n        if (!action.isApplicable()) {\n            iterator.remove();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis should resolve the `ConcurrentModificationException` and allow the code to run without issues."}
