USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Converting images from .bmp to jpeg2000 on java and eclipse error: :I have seen some examples here and installed Java Advanced Imaging Image I/O Tools on my computer, because obviously it is a requirement of processing JPEG2000 images.After install this i am able to import librariese.g. import com.sun.media.imageio.plugins.*;after importing, i should be able to use constructors or methods of that library but i am getting this error: \"Access restriction: The type 'J2KImageWriteParam' is not API (restriction on required library 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Java\\jre1.8.0_77\\lib\\ext\\jai_imageio.jar')\" After a litle bit research, i found out that i can change eclipse preferences and ignore that error. I went through this way: Preferences -> Java -> Compiler -> Errors / Warnings -> Deprecated and Restricted API. Then i changed errors to warnings. But now i can not use that library efficient, cause eclipse suggest me nothing about that library.My first question is; if there is a better way to do that? Or maybe another way to use this library efficient in eclipse?EDIT: I found out it was a complication of 32 and 64 bit versions. After installing 32bit JDK and reference the jai_imageio.jar it worked fine.And second; Can anybody give a plain example to me about converting .bmp image to jpeg2000 image. That would help a lot to me about undesrtanding the context.Thank you\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: Iterator iterator = imageIO.readImageData(\"path/to/image.bmp\", null); iterator.next();\n<<<explanation>>>: This code uses the Java Advanced Imaging (Java AI) library to read an image in the .bmp format and convert it to a JPEG2000 image. The code creates an iterator using the readImageData method, which reads the image data from the specified file and returns an iterator for the image pixels. The next() method is then called on the iterator to retrieve the first pixel value, which is the first frame of the JPEG2000 image. This process is repeated for each frame of the image to create a complete JPEG2000 image."}
