USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: using JTables with netbeans 6.1 aka Matisse: :Before you answer: Yes I have read the jtable tutorial over at Sun. No, it did not help me. Yes, I am a dolt. Please don't answer with a reference to that document. What I am specifically interested in is how to dynamically add rows and columns to my Jtable via the Netbeans IDE. I already have an object that contains a hashmap with my data. I can't figure out where or what object I should be passing that object to. Thanks for your time! I have a vector that contains a series (of length l) of objects (each one corresponding to a row). How do I get that vector object to display on the JTable?\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.util.Map.get()\n<<<code>>>: myVector.get(i).getClass().getDeclaredFields()[j].setAccessible(true).get(myVector.get(i))\n<<<explanation>>>: To dynamically add rows and columns to a JTable in Netbeans using JTables, you can use the JTable.setModel() method and pass in a DefaultTableModel object that contains the data from your vector. To access the data in the vector, you can use the get() method on the vector and then use the getClass().getDeclaredFields()[j].setAccessible(true).get(myVector.get(i)) method to set the value of the corresponding column in the table."}
