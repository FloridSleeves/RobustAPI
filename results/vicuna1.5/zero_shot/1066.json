{"api": "StringTokenizer.nextToken", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Unable to get String.split() to work as expected on android: :I want to split an email string in java (android) but it not work correctly. Input: \"ihnel48@gmail.com\"String[] pattens = email.split(\"@.\");Expected: \"ihnel48\", \"gmail\", \"com\"Output: \"ihnel48\" \"mail.com\"\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.util.StringTokenizer\n<<<code>>>: StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(email, \"@.\");\nst.nextToken();\nString[] patterns = new String[3];\npatterns[0] = st.nextToken();\npatterns[1] = st.nextToken();\npatterns[2] = st.nextToken();\n<<<explanation>>>: The issue with the given code is that it only splits the email string once using the \"@\" character as a delimiter, and the expected output is split into three separate strings. To achieve this, we can use the StringTokenizer class in Java. We create a new StringTokenizer object with the email string as the input and the \"@\" character as the delimiter. Then, we call the nextToken() method three times to get the three separate strings. Finally, we store these strings in an array of strings."}
