(11 answers)                            Closed 8 years ago.In my program I'm trying to print my output to a file but the file is empty. The program reads text files in a directory. I get the desired output to the console but not in the output.text file. Not sure what is missing in the program. thanks in advance for the help.import java.io.*;public class CacheData {    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {        String target_dir = \"C:\\\\Files\";        String output = \"C:\\\\Files\\\\output.txt\";        File dir = new File(target_dir);        File[] files = dir.listFiles();        for (File textfiles : files) {            if (textfiles.isFile() && textfiles.getName().endsWith(\".txt\")) {                BufferedReader inputStream = null;                try {                    inputStream = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(textfiles));                    String line;                    while ((line = inputStream.readLine()) != null) {                        System.out.println(line);                    PrintWriter outputStream = new PrintWriter(output);                    outputStream.println();                    outputStream.close();                    }                } finally {                    if (inputStream != null) {                        inputStream.close();                    }                }            }        }    }}\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "The code provided is using the PrintWriter class to write the output to a file, but it is not properly closing the PrintWriter after each write operation. This is causing the file to become empty. To fix this issue, the PrintWriter should be closed after each write operation using the close() method.\n\nHere is an updated version of the code that should work correctly:\n```\nimport java.io.*;\n\npublic class CacheData {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        String target_dir = \"C:\\\\Files\";\n        String output = \"C:\\\\Files\\\\output.txt\";\n        File dir = new File(target_dir);\n        File[] files = dir.listFiles();\n        for (File textfiles : files) {\n            if (textfiles.isFile() && textfiles.getName().endsWith(\".txt\")) {\n                BufferedReader inputStream = null;\n                try {\n                    inputStream = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(textfiles));\n                    String line;\n                    while ((line = inputStream.readLine()) != null) {\n                        System.out.println(line);\n                        PrintWriter outputStream = new PrintWriter(output);\n                        outputStream.println();\n                        outputStream.close();\n                    }\n                } finally {\n                    if (inputStream != null) {\n                        inputStream.close();\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code should properly write the output to the file and not leave it empty."}
