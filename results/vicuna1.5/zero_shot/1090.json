First, create a new StringTokenizer object and pass in the original string as a parameter. Then, call the nextToken() method to get the first token in the string. Use a while loop to keep calling the hasMoreTokens() method to check if there are more tokens in the string. While there are more tokens, call the nextToken() method to get the next token and add it to the array. Finally, increment the count variable to keep track of the number of elements in the array."}
