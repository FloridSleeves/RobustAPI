USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Generator functions equivalent in Java: :I would like to implement an Iterator in Java that behaves somewhat like the following generator function in Python:def iterator(array):   for x in array:      if x!= None:        for y in x:          if y!= None:            for z in y:              if z!= None:                yield zx on the java side can be multi-dimensional array or some form of nested collection. I am not sure how this would work. Ideas?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: Iterator iterator = new Iterator() {\n    private Iterator<Object> iterator1 = null;\n    private Iterator<Object> iterator2 = null;\n    private Iterator<Object> iterator3 = null;\n\n    @Override\n    public boolean hasNext() {\n        return iterator1.hasNext() && iterator2.hasNext() && iterator3.hasNext();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public Object next() {\n        if (!hasNext()) {\n            throw new NoSuchElementException();\n        }\n\n        Object result = null;\n\n        if (iterator1.hasNext()) {\n            result = iterator1.next();\n        }\n\n        if (result != null) {\n            if (iterator2.hasNext()) {\n                result = iterator2.next();\n            }\n\n            if (result != null) {\n                if (iterator3.hasNext()) {\n                    result = iterator3.next();\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        return result;\n    }\n};\n\n<<<explanation>>>: To implement a generator-like iterator in Java using the Iterator.next() method, you can create an iterator that checks the hasNext() method of its nested iterators. If all the nested iterators have next() elements, the iterator will return the first element. Otherwise, it will return null. This approach allows you to use a multi-dimensional array or any form of nested collection as the generator's underlying data structure."}
