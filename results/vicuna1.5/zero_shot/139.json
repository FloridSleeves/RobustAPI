The `FileChannel.write` method can only write a limited amount of data (typically a few megabytes) before it needs to be synchronized with the operating system, which can lead to performance issues and potential errors.\n\nTo write a large byte array to a file, you should use the `FileChannel.write` method in a loop, breaking the data into smaller chunks and writing each chunk separately. You can use the `FileChannel.write` method with a `ByteBuffer` object to write data in a more efficient manner. Here's an example of how you can modify the given code to write the byte array in smaller chunks:\n```java\nprivate static void write(byte[] data) throws Exception {\n    File file = new File(\"C:/temp/file.json\");\n    int length = data.length;\n    RandomAccessFile raf = new RandomAccessFile(file, \"rw\");\n    FileChannel fc = raf.getChannel();\n    MappedByteBuffer buffer = fc.map(FileChannel.MapMode.READ_WRITE, 0, length);\n    for (int i = 0; i < length; i += 1024) {\n        ByteBuffer chunk = buffer.slice();\n        chunk.put(data, i, 1024);\n        fc.write(chunk);\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this modified code, the byte array is divided into smaller chunks of 1024 bytes each, and each chunk is written to the file using the `FileChannel.write` method with a `ByteBuffer` object. This approach is more efficient and should avoid the IOException: Map Failed issue when writing large byte arrays to a file."}
