USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: thread safe LinkedHashMap without Collections.synchronized: :I am using a LinkedHashMap and the environment is multi threaded so this structure needs to be thread safe. During specific events I need to read the entire map push to db and clear all. Most of time only writes happen to this map. This map has a limit 50 entries.I am using Oracle MAF and it does not have Collections.syncronizedMap available. So, what are things I need to put in synchronized blocks to make sure writing and reading doesn't hit me concurrentModificationException etcFew requirements:I need to behave it like a circular queue so Overriding removeEldestEntry method of the LinkedHashMap. I need to preserve the order\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>:\nIterator<Map.Entry<K, V>> iterator = map.iterator();\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\nMap.Entry<K, V> entry = iterator.next();\n// Perform read operation on entry\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>:\nTo ensure thread safety when reading from a LinkedHashMap in a multi-threaded environment, you can use the `Iterator.next()` method. This method returns the next entry in the iterator without removing it from the map, allowing you to read the entries without worrying about concurrent modification exceptions.\n\nTo preserve the order of the entries, you can override the `removeEldestEntry()` method of the LinkedHashMap and implement a custom version that removes the first entry in the iterator while preserving the order. This will allow you to read the entries in the order they were added to the map.\n\nHere's an example implementation that meets your requirements:\n```java\nimport java.util.LinkedHashMap;\nimport java.util.Map;\n\npublic class CircularLinkedHashMap<K, V> extends LinkedHashMap<K, V> {\n    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;\n    private int maxSize;\n\n    public CircularLinkedHashMap(int maxSize) {\n        super(maxSize, 0.75f, true);\n        this.maxSize = maxSize;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public boolean removeEldestEntry(Map.Entry<K, V> eldest) {\n        return size() > maxSize;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public Iterator<Map.Entry<K, V>> iterator() {\n        return new Iterator<Map.Entry<K, V>>() {\n            private Iterator<Map.Entry<K, V>> iterator = super.iterator();\n\n            {\n                if (!iterator.hasNext()) {\n                    iterator = super.descendingMap().iterator();\n                }\n            }\n\n            @Override\n            public boolean hasNext() {\n                return iterator.hasNext();\n            }\n\n            @Override\n            public Map.Entry<K, V> next() {\n                return iterator.next();\n            }\n        };\n    }\n}\n```\nYou can then use this custom `CircularLinkedHashMap` in your code to read the entries in the desired order without worrying about thread safety issues."}
