First thing I do is creating the folders, then I create the files.try {        if (!new File(\"Results\\\\\" + p.getName()).exists()) {            new File(\"Results\\\\\" + p.getName()).mkdir();        }    } catch (Exception e) {        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, \"Error creating the directory\");    }try {    PrintWriter  writer = new PrintWriter (\"Results\\\\\" + p.getName() + \"\\\\\" + simulation.getNameSim(), \"utf-8\");     //After this instruction jumps to exception    //Code    } catch (Exception e) {    }The variables p.getName and simulation.getName have the information. The debug says there are no erros creating the directory but after the print the program throws an exception.Any ideas?
