USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java: Enumeration from Set<String>: :I have a simple collections question. I have a Set<String> object. I want an Enumeration<String> of the Strings in that Set. I need an Enumeration<String> since I am overriding a method that specifically returns an Enumeration<String>. What is the cleanest/best way to go about it?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.util.Set.iterator()\n<<<code>>>: set.iterator()\n<<<explanation>>>: The cleanest and best way to get an Enumeration<String> from a Set<String> is to use the iterator() method of the Set class. This method returns an Iterator<String> that allows you to iterate over the elements of the Set. To get an Enumeration<String>, you can use the iterator() method and call the next() method on the returned Iterator object. This will return the first element of the Set and allow you to use the hasNext() method to check if there are more elements in the Set."}
