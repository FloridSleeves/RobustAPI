{"api": "RandomAccessFile.read", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Read file and split into multiple files: :I have a file which I would like to read in Java and split this file into n (user input) output files. Here is how I read the file:int n = 4;BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"file.csv\"));try {    String line = br.readLine();    while (line != null) {        line = br.readLine();    }} finally {    br.close();}How do I split the file - file.csv into n files?Note - Since the number of entries in the file are of the order of 100k, I can't store the file content into an array and then split it and save into multiple files.\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: RandomAccessFile.read\n<<<code>>>: RandomAccessFile raf = new RandomAccessFile(\"file.csv\", \"r\");raf.seek(0);String line = raf.readLine();while (line != null) {raf.seek(raf.length());line = raf.readLine();}raf.close();\n\nExplanation:\nThis code uses the RandomAccessFile class to read the file \"file.csv\" line by line. The seek() method is used to move the file pointer to the beginning of the file, and the readLine() method is used to read each line of the file. The while loop continues until the end of the file is reached, and the file is closed using the close() method.\n\nNote: This code assumes that the file is in CSV format, with each line representing a separate entry. If the file is in a different format, the code may need to be modified accordingly."}
