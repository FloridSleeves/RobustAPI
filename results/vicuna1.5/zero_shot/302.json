USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to iterate through all the json values in order as when they were inserted?: :In my android app, I get a json value and iterate through them by doing this    if (response != null) {        try {            JSONObject object = new JSONObject(response);            Iterator enu = object.keys();            ArrayList<String> locationList = new ArrayList<String>();            while(enu.hasNext()) {                locationList.add(object.getString((String) enu.next()));            }            callerContext.DisplayLocations(locationList);        } catch (JSONException e) {            Toast.makeText(callerContext, callerContext.getResources().getString(R.string.error_message), Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();        }    }The problem is the ArrayList if I then iterate through that, the values are in a different order then when I insert then in the php code...How do I loop through the json object in the same order as when they were inserted?Thanks.EDIT:PHP            $data = array();            for ($i = 0; $i < $num_records; $i++) {                array_push($data,                     array(\"id{$i}\" => mysql_result($recordset, $i, 'id')),                     array(\"location{$i}\" => mysql_result($recordset, $i, 'location')),                     array(\"date{$i}\" => mysql_result($recordset, $i, 'date added'))                );            }\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: Iterator enu = object.keys(); enu.next();\n<<<explanation>>>: By using Iterator.next(), you can iterate through the keys of the JSON object in the same order as they were inserted. This will ensure that the values in the ArrayList are also in the same order as they were inserted."}
