USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I normalize the EOL character in Java?: :I have a linux server and many clients with many operating systems. The server takes an input file from clients. Linux has end of line char LF, while Mac has end of line char CR, andWindows has end of line char CR+LFThe server needs as end of line char LF. Using java, I want to ensure that the file will always use the linux eol char LF. How can I achieve it?\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.io.DataOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>: DataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(\"input.txt\"));\nString line = \"line1\\nline2\\r\\nline3\";\ndos.writeUTF(line);\ndos.write('\\n');\ndos.close();\n\n<<<explanation>>>: To normalize the EOL character in Java, you can use the DataOutputStream.write method to write the input file to a FileOutputStream. In this example, the EOL character is normalized to LF by writing the string \"line1\\nline2\\r\\nline3\" to the output file. The first writeUTF method call writes the string as a sequence of bytes, including the EOL character, and the second write method call writes the EOL character as a literal byte value. This ensures that the output file always uses the Linux EOL character LF."}
