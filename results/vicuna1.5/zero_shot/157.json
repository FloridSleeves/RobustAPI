{"api": "InputStream.read", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I create constrained InputStream to read only part of the file?: :I want to create an InputStream that is limited to a certain range of bytes in file, e.g. to bytes from position 0 to 100. So that the client code should see EOF once 100th byte is reached.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "To create a constrained InputStream that reads only a certain range of bytes from a file, you can use the following code:\n\n<<<api>>>: java.io.InputStream\n<<<code>>>: InputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream(\"filename.txt\");\nint startPosition = 0;\nint endPosition = 100;\nInputStream restrictedInputStream = new RestrictedInputStream(inputStream, startPosition, endPosition);\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The above code creates a new FileInputStream object to read the contents of a file named \"filename.txt\". Then, it creates two integer variables, startPosition and endPosition, which represent the starting and ending positions of the range of bytes to be read from the file. Finally, it creates a new RestrictedInputStream object by passing the inputStream object, startPosition, and endPosition as parameters to the constructor. The RestrictedInputStream object will only allow reading up to the endPosition byte, after which it will throw an EOFException."}
