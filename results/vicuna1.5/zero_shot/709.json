If yes, then how?: :If we can use PrintWriter Class in making an Android App, then what is the mistake in the following code? My app stops working on pressing the button 'save'public void save(View view)    {        text=data.getText().toString();        PrintWriter writer=null;        try {            writer=new PrintWriter(filename);        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {            msg.setText(\"FileNotFoundException\");            }        writer.print(text);        writer.flush();        writer.close();        msg.setText(\"Data Saved Successfully\");    }}\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(filename); writer.write(text); writer.flush(); writer.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The given code uses the PrintWriter.write() method to write the string 'text' to a file specified by the 'filename' variable. The write() method writes the given string to the file and then flushes the output stream to ensure that the data is written to the file. Finally, the write() method is closed to release any resources associated with it."}
