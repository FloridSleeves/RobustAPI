I have following type of HashMapMap<Integer,ArrayList<String> > trainDataSet = new HashMap<Integer, ArrayList<String>>();I would like to shuffle the values in the Map. How would i do it? Following is my attempt:    collections.shuffle(trainDataSet.values());Got an error:    Values cannot be cast to java.util.ListYes this make sense, because my values are in Arraylist not in List. Would it be possible to shuffle collections of arraylist?EDITIf i have following order::key1  [aa,bb,cd]key2  [xx,xy,sfr]Into something likekey1  [xx,xy,sfr]key2  [aa,bb,cd]\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.util.Iterator\n<<<code>>>: trainDataSet.values().iterator()\n<<<explanation>>>: To shuffle the values in a HashMap, you can use the iterator to iterate through the values and then use the `Collections.shuffle` method to shuffle the Iterator.next.values() in the order of the keys in the HashMap."}
