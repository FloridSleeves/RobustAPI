{"api": "StringTokenizer.nextToken", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Trim string after newline: :My string is say :str1=\"ashdef\";I want to remove anything after the newline so my desired string would be only \"ash\".How do I do this, One thing could be I could trim this and then substring it . Any other ways which I can do this.Thanks \nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: str1 = \"ashdef\";\nStringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(str1);\nString desiredString = st.nextToken();\nSystem.out.println(desiredString);\n\nExplanation:\nThe above code uses the StringTokenizer class to split the string \"ashdef\" into tokens. The nextToken() method is used to retrieve the next token in the string, which in this case is \"ash\". The desiredString variable is assigned the value of the nextToken(), and is then printed to the console.\n\nAlternatively, you could use the following code to achieve the same result:\n\n<<<api>>>: String.substring\n<<<code>>>: str1 = \"ashdef\";\nString desiredString = str1.substring(0, str1.indexOf(\"\\n\") - 1);\nSystem.out.println(desiredString);\n\nExplanation:\nThe above code uses the substring() method to retrieve a substring of the string \"ashdef\", starting at the beginning of the string and ending at the index of the newline character (\"\\n\") before it. The substring() method returns an empty string after the newline character, so the desiredString variable is assigned the value of the substring before the newline character. The desiredString is then printed to the console."}
