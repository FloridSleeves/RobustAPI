USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I use Joiner, to join only specific properties?: :Let's say I have this class:public class MyClass {    private String propertyOne;    private String propertyTwo;    // getters setters...}Now, in my test method, I am trying something like:List<MyClass> myList = myListDao.findAll(); String aStringFullOfPropertyOnesOfAllMyObjects =  Joiner.on(\", \").join(myList.iterator());The String, I want to get back is something like:\"propOneOfObjectOne, propOneOfObjectTwo, propOneOfObjectThree\"How can I do this?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: myList.iterator().next().getPropertyOne()\n<<<explanation>>>: You can use the Iterator.next() method to get the next element in the iterator, and then use the getPropertyOne() method to get the value of the propertyOne field of the object. This will give you the value of propertyOne for the first object in the list. You can then use a loop to iterate through the rest of the objects and get their propertyOne values, joining them with a comma and a space."}
