Here's an example code:\n\n<<<code>>>:\n```java\nimport java.io.IOException;\n\npublic class XSSFilterWrapper extends HttpServletRequestWrapper {\n    private HttpServletRequest request;\n    private String newBody;\n\n    public XSSFilterWrapper(HttpServletRequest request) {\n        this.request = request;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public ServletInputStream getInputStream() throws IOException {\n        return new ServletInputStream() {\n            private InputStream inputStream = request.getInputStream();\n\n            @Override\n            public int read() throws IOException {\n                return inputStream.read();\n            }\n\n            @Override\n            public void close() throws IOException {\n                try {\n                    inputStream.close();\n                } catch (IOException e) {\n                    e.printStackTrace();\n                }\n            }\n        };\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String getRequestBody() {\n        return newBody;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void setRequestBody(String requestBody) {\n        newBody = requestBody;\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this code, we create a custom wrapper class `XSSFilterWrapper` that extends `HttpServletRequestWrapper`. We override the `getInputStream()` method to create a new `ServletInputStream` that reads from the original request body. We also override the `read()` method to read a single byte from the input stream and the `close()` method to close the input stream.\n\nTo change the request body, we can create a new instance of `XSSFilterWrapper` and pass it to the filter. In the filter's `doFilter()` method, we can set the request body of the new wrapper instance. Here's an example code:\n\n<<<code>>>:\n```java\nimport javax.servlet.*;\nimport javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;\nimport javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;\nimport java.io.IOException;\n\npublic class XSSFilter implements Filter {\n    @Override\n    public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain) throws IOException, ServletException {\n        HttpServletRequest httpRequest = (HttpServletRequest) request;\n        HttpServletResponse httpResponse = (HttpServletResponse) response;\n\n        // Create a new XSSFilterWrapper instance\n        XSSFilterWrapper wrapper = new XSSFilterWrapper(httpRequest);\n        httpRequest = wrapper;\n\n        // Set the request body of the new wrapper instance\n        httpRequest.setRequestBody(\"New request body\");\n\n        // Call the next filter in the chain\n        chain.doFilter(httpRequest, httpResponse);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void destroy() {\n        // Do nothing\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void init(FilterConfig filterConfig) throws ServletException {\n        // Do nothing\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this code, we create a new instance of `XSSFilterWrapper` and pass it to the `HttpServletRequest` object. We then set the request body of the new wrapper instance to \"New request body\". Finally, we call the next filter in the chain.\n\nNote that this code is just an example and may not work as-is. You may need to modify it to fit your specific requirements. Also, this code does not provide any protection against XSS attacks. You may need to use additional techniques to protect against XSS attacks, such as encoding the request body or using a library that provides XSS protection."}
