USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I read/write bits from/to a file in Java?: :I need to read file stream as bits and then I should be able to write bits to file again. Are there any classes for this purpose?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "InputStream.read() method can be used to read a single byte from an InputStream. To read bits from an InputStream, you can convert each byte to an integer and then extract the desired number of bits from the integer. Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to read bits from an InputStream:\n```java\nimport java.io.FileInputStream;\nimport java.io.IOException;\n\npublic class BitReader {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        FileInputStream fileInputStream = new FileInputStream(\"example.txt\");\n        byte[] buffer = new byte[8];\n        int bitsRead = 0;\n\n        // Read bytes from the InputStream until there are no more bits to read\n        while (fileInputStream.read(buffer) != -1) {\n            for (int i = 0; i < buffer.length; i++) {\n                int byteValue = buffer[i] & 0xFF;\n                bitsRead += Byte.SIZE;\n                if (bitsRead > 8) {\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Write the bits back to the file\n        fileInputStream.close();\n        FileOutputStream fileOutputStream = new FileOutputStream(\"example.txt\");\n        for (int i = 0; i < bitsRead; i++) {\n            fileOutputStream.write(i >> 3);\n            fileOutputStream.write(i & 0x07);\n        }\n        fileOutputStream.close();\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, we read 8 bits at a time from the InputStream and store them in a byte array. We then extract the desired number of bits from each byte and write them back to the file. Note that we write the bits in little-endian format, which is the default format in Java. If you need to write the bits in big-endian format, you can swap the bits before writing them to the file."}
