USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Can I change the type of stream I'm using without closing and reopening the socket in Java?: :I'm doing some socket programming in Java and I'd like to be able to change between using the ObjectOutputStream, the DataOutputStream, and the PrintWriter all within the same socket/connection.  Is this possible and what is the best way to do it?I've tried just creating both types of objects, for example ObjectOutputStream and DataOutputStream, but that doesn't seem to work.The reason I want to switch between them is to, for example, send a text command \"INFO\" that signals I'm about to send an object with information or a command \"DATA\" signalling that I'm about to send data.  Any advice on the best way to do this is appreciated.\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: DataOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>: DataOutputStream.write(int)\n<<<explanation>>>: Yes, you can change the type of stream you're using without closing and reopening the socket in Java. To do this, you can simply create both types of objects, for example, ObjectOutputStream and DataOutputStream, and use the DataOutputStream.write method to write data to the stream. The DataOutputStream.write method writes an integer value to the stream, which can be used to indicate the type of data that will follow. For example, you can use the integer value 1 to indicate that you are about to send an object with information, and the integer value 2 to indicate that you are about to send data. This way, you can switch between the different types of streams without closing and reopening the socket."}
