{"api": "InputStream.read", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How do I read / convert an InputStream into a String in Java?: :If you have a java.io.InputStream object, how should you process that object and produce a String?Suppose I have an InputStream that contains text data, and I want to convert it to a String, so for example I can write that to a log file.What is the easiest way to take the InputStream and convert it to a String?public String convertStreamToString(InputStream is) {// ???}\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.io.InputStream.read()\n<<<code>>>: is.read()\n<<<explanation>>>: The `read()` method of the `InputStream` class reads a single byte of data from the input stream. To convert an `InputStream` to a `String`, you can use a loop to read byte by byte and build the string character by character. Here's an example implementation of the `convertStreamToString` method:\n```java\npublic String convertStreamToString(InputStream is) {\n    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n    int bytesRead;\n    while ((bytesRead = is.read()) != -1) {\n        sb.append((char) bytesRead);\n    }\n    return sb.toString();\n}\n```\nThis method reads bytes from the input stream and appends them to a `StringBuilder` until it reaches the end of the stream (-1 is returned by `read()` when there's no more data to read). Finally, the method returns the `String` representation of the `StringBuilder`."}
