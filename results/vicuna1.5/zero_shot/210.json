Is there any other way I can do this with FileReader? I know that there is the BOMInputStream that should work, but I'd rather find a solution using FileReader.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.io.InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: InputStream isRead = new FileInputStream(file);\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\nint bytesRead = 0;\nwhile ((bytesRead = isRead.read(buffer)) != -1) {\nString line = new String(buffer, 0, bytesRead);\nline = removeUTF8BOM(line);\nSystem.out.println(line);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The issue with the previous code is that it only reads the file once and then tries to remove the BOM character from the entire string. To properly remove the BOM character, you need to read the file in chunks and process each chunk separately. This code uses a while loop to continuously read the file and remove the BOM character from each line."}
