You can achieve this by using the Iterator.next() method.\n\nIn your code, you are using a while loop to iterate through the LinkedList and also using an iterator variable iter2 to keep track of the current element being iterated. However, the issue is that the while loop is not allowing you to move to the next element after the first iteration.\n\nTo fix this, you can use the Iterator.next() method to move to the next element in the LinkedList after each iteration of the while loop. This will allow you to iterate through the LinkedList using a For construct and also have an numerical iterator.\n\nSo, your code should look like this:\nfor (SearchResult result : docSearch) {\nwhile (iter2 < 50) {\n//do stuff\niter2 = iter2 + 1;\n}\n}\niter2 = docSearch.iterator().next();\nwhile (iter2 < 50) {\n//do stuff\niter2 = iter2 + 1;\n}\n}"}
