USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to make my image visible by time counter?: :I want to make simple animation using multi-images on android studioi have 3 images (img1,img2,img3)and i want img1 visible firstly then after half second img1 invisible and img2 visible,then after half second img2 invisible and img3 visible,then after half second img3 invisible and img1 visible, so return to the first image like circle 1>2>3>1>2>3>1>2>3 to unlimited time, so how can i do that, please\nPlease using this api: Activity.findViewById.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: android.content.Context.findViewById\n<<<code>>>: activity.findViewById(R.id.imageView)\n<<<explanation>>>: To make the image visible by time counter, you can use the Android Animation framework to animate the visibility of the image using the `Animation` class. Here's an example code snippet that shows how to animate the visibility of an image using the `Animation` class:\n```java\n// Get the image view\nImageView imageView = (ImageView) activity.findViewById(R.id.imageView);\n\n// Create a new animation using the Animation class\nAnimation animation = new AlphaAnimation(1.0f, 0.0f);\nanimation.setDuration(500); // Animation duration in milliseconds\nanimation.setRepeatCount(1); // Repeat the animation once\n\n// Set the image view as the target of the animation\nimageView.startAnimation(animation);\n\n// Create a new animation using the Animation class\nanimation = new AlphaAnimation(0.0f, 1.0f);\nanimation.setDuration(500); // Animation duration in milliseconds\nanimation.setRepeatCount(1); // Repeat the animation once\n\n// Set the image view as the target of the animation\nimageView.startAnimation(animation);\n```\nIn this example, we create two `AlphaAnimation` objects, one to animate the image becoming invisible and another to animate the image becoming visible. The `setDuration()` method is used to set the duration of the animation in milliseconds, and the `setRepeatCount()` method is used to specify that the animation should be repeated once. Finally, we call the `startAnimation()` method on the image view to start the animation.\n\nYou can modify this code snippet to suit your specific needs, such as changing the image views, animations, and durations."}
