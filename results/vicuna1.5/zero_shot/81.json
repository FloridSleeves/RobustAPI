USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Can I change the type of stream I'm using without closing and reopening the socket in Java?: :I'm doing some socket programming in Java and I'd like to be able to change between using the ObjectOutputStream, the DataOutputStream, and the PrintWriter all within the same socket/connection.  Is this possible and what is the best way to do it?I've tried just creating both types of objects, for example ObjectOutputStream and DataOutputStream, but that doesn't seem to work.The reason I want to switch between them is to, for example, send a text command \"INFO\" that signals I'm about to send an object with information or a command \"DATA\" signalling that I'm about to send data.  Any advice on the best way to do this is appreciated.\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: DataOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>: DataOutputStream.write(int)\n<<<explanation>>>: Yes, you can change the type of stream you're using without closing and reopening the socket in Java. To do this, you can simply create both types of objects, for example, ObjectOutputStream and DataOutputStream, and use the DataOutputStream.write method to write the data. The DataOutputStream.write method allows you to write any type of data, including text commands and object data. You can use this method to write both text commands and object data without having to close and reopen the socket."}
