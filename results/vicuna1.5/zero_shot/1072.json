USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Reading CSV file without third-party libraries: :I'm trying to read a csv file into either an ArrayList or a String [][] array. In this I'm trying to read it into a list and then form the list, using a tokenizer, into an array. The csv file have 7 columns (A - G) and 961 rows (1-961). My for loop for the 2D array keeps returning a null pointer, but I think it should be working..public class FoodFacts{    private static BufferedReader textIn;    private static BufferedReader foodFacts;            static int numberOfLines = 0;             static String [][] foodArray;    public static String  aFact;    static  int NUM_COL = 7;    static int NUM_ROW = 961;    // Make a random number to pull a line    static Random r = new Random();    public static void main(String[] args)    {        try         {            textIn = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));            foodFacts= new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"foodfacts.csv\"));            Scanner factFile = new Scanner(foodFacts);            List<String> facts = new ArrayList<String>();            String fact;            System.out.println(\"Please type in the food you wish to know about.\");            String request = textIn.readLine();            while ( factFile.hasNextLine()){                fact = factFile.nextLine();                StringTokenizer st2 = new StringTokenizer(fact, \",\");                //facts.add(fact);                numberOfLines++;                while (st2.hasMoreElements()){                    for ( int j = 0; j < NUM_COL ; j++) {                        for (int i = 0; i < NUM_ROW ; i++){                            foodArray [j][i]= st2.nextToken();  //NULL POINTER HERE                            System.out.println(foodArray[j][i]);                        }                    }                }            }        }        catch (IOException e)        {            System.out.println (\"Error, problem reading text file!\");            e.printStackTrace();        }     } }\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.util.StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: foodArray[j][i] = StringTokenizer.nextToken(fact);\n<<<explanation>>>: This line of code is assigning the next token returned by the StringTokenizer to the element at position (j, i) of the 2D array \"foodArray\". The token is being retrieved from the current line of the CSV file being read by the BufferedReader. However, it seems that the token is being retrieved as null, which could be due to the end of the line being reached before all the tokens have been read."}
