USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to pipe stream to java program?: :Under cmd.exe, I can do like this:dir *.*|grep ....I want to do this to java programdir *.i|java test What I should do in my java test class?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.io.InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\nString line = br.readLine();\nwhile (line != null) {\nString[] parts = line.split(\"\\\\s+\");\nfor (String part : parts) {\nif (part.contains(\"i\")) {\nSystem.out.println(part);\n}\n}\nline = br.readLine();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: To pipe a stream to a Java program, you can use the `InputStream.read` method to read the input stream and process it in your Java program. In this case, you can use a `BufferedReader` to read the input from the command line and split the input by whitespace to extract the individual parts. You can then check each part for the presence of the string \"i\" and print it to the console if it is found. This will allow you to process the input stream in your Java program."}
