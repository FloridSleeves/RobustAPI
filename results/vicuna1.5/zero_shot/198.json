{"api": "InputStream.read", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to parse multiple, consecutive xml files in one document?: :I have a big text file that is a sequence of XML-valid documents that looks something like this:<DOC>   <TEXT> ... </TEXT>    ...</DOC><DOC>    <TEXT> ... </TEXT>    ...</DOC>etc. There is no <?xml version=\"1.0\">, the <DOC></DOC> delimits each separate xml. What's the best way to parse this in Java and get the values under <TEXT> in each <DOC>?If I pass the whole thing to a DocumentBuilder, I get an error saying the document is not well formed. Is there a better solution than simply traversing through, a building a string for each <DOC>?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "To parse multiple, consecutive XML files in one document, you can use the `InputStream.read()` method to read the entire input stream as a single string. Then, you can use a regular expression to split the string into individual XML documents, and finally parse each document to extract the values under <TEXT>.\n\nHere's some sample code that demonstrates how to do this in Java:\n```java\nimport java.io.InputStream;\nimport java.util.regex.Matcher;\nimport java.util.regex.Pattern;\n\npublic class XmlParser {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\n        InputStream inputStream = ...; // your input stream\n        String xmlString = InputStream.read(inputStream);\n\n        // split the string into individual XML documents\n        String[] xmlDocuments = xmlString.split(\"(?<=<DOC>)([\\s\\S]+?)(?=</DOC>)\", Pattern.DOTALL);\n\n        // parse each XML document and extract the values under <TEXT>\n        for (String xmlDocument : xmlDocuments) {\n            DocumentBuilderFactory dbFactory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();\n            DocumentBuilder dBuilder = dbFactory.newDocumentBuilder();\n            Document doc = dBuilder.parse(new StringReader(xmlDocument));\n            // extract the values under <TEXT>\n            // ...\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nIn the above code, the `InputStream.read()` method is used to read the entire input stream as a single string. Then, the `split()` method is used to split the string into individual XML documents using a regular expression. The regular expression `(?<=<DOC>)([\\s\\S]+?)(?=</DOC>)` matches the <DOC> tag and captures all the characters between the <DOC> and </DOC> tags as a single string. Finally, for each XML document, the `DocumentBuilderFactory` and `DocumentBuilder` classes are used to parse the document and extract the values under <TEXT>."}
