USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Parse Excel data in Java effectivley: :I'm supposed to realize a Java application that should retrieve data out of an excel spreadsheet and link it to some objects I've already created in order to apply some calculations on them, then display the result .About the app==> The excel spreadsheet is a survey to measure a bank's clients satisfaction about the bank's services.==> The application should parse the data in the spreadsheet, and do some calculations on it.==> The result should be displayed using an interactive GUI .What I've done so farI've analysed to problem and create all the objects I will need in my application.I Actually did some search here on stackoverflow.com and think that Apache POI would be very useful.Where I need helpThe problem is that I have no idea about what I should begin with .Any suggestions on how to accomplish this , what tools, languages, API or design pattern I should use is more than welcome.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: Iterator<XSSFRow> rows = sheet.iterator();\nwhile (rows.hasNext()) {\nXSSFRow row = rows.next();\nString firstName = row.getCell(0).getStringCellValue();\nString lastName = row.getCell(1).getStringCellValue();\nString email = row.getCell(2).getStringCellValue();\n// perform calculations on the data and store the result in a variable\n// ...\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The above code uses the Apache POI library to iterate through the rows of an XSSF (Excel 2007/2010) spreadsheet and retrieve the values of the cells in each row. The `Iterator.next()` method is used to move the iterator to the next row in the spreadsheet. The `getCell()` method is used to retrieve the value of a cell in the current row. The values of the cells are then stored in variables for further processing."}
