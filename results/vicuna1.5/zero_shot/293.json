USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: add additional parameters to foreach loop: :I have a foreach loop that goesboolean doesWordMatch = false;for(Character[] charArr : charSets){  if(doesWordMatch)    //dosomething  else    break;}I was wondering, is there anyway to put the condition into the for loop? e.g.for(Character[] charArr : charSets && doesWordMatch == true){  //dosomething}edit-- Right, so would this be possible in a while loop? :o\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next()\n<<<code>>>: for(Iterator<Character[]> iterator : charSets) {\nif(iterator.next() && doesWordMatch) {\n//dosomething\n}\nelse {\nbreak;\n}\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: Yes, you can use a for-each loop and the Iterator.next() method to add additional parameters to the loop. In this case, the loop will iterate through the charSets array and check if the current element is not null and if the doesWordMatch variable is true. If both conditions are true, it will execute the code block inside the loop. If either condition is false, it will break out of the loop."}
