USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to end a file scanner while loop with undetermined length correctly in java: :I wrote a function that scans a tab delimited file of baseball stats.public static ArrayList dataRead() throws FileNotFoundException {    //ArrayList array = new ArrayList<ArrayList>();    Scanner s = new Scanner(new File(\"c:\\\\stats.txt\")).useDelimiter(\"\\r\");    ArrayList<String> array = new ArrayList<String>();    int i = 0;    while(s.next() != null) {        String currentLine = s.next();        Scanner split = new Scanner(currentLine).useDelimiter(\"\\t\");        for(int j = 0; j < 16; j++) {            System.out.print(split.next() + \" \");            j++;        }        System.out.println(\"\\r\");    }    s.close();    return array;}This function works until the end of the file. To my knowledge the while loop should close at the end of the file because it returns null, but I keep getting a noSuchElement error instead. If I could guarantee the file size, I would just use a for loop with the size, but I can't because team size could technically vary. How would I properly end the file scanner while loop so I can close the scanner?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: s.next()\n<<<explanation>>>: Instead of using the `s.next()` method to read the next line of the file, you can use `StringTokenizer` to split the current line into individual tokens. Then, you can check if the next token is null, which will indicate that the end of the file has been reached. Here's the modified code:\n```java\npublic static ArrayList<String> dataRead() throws FileNotFoundException {\n    //ArrayList array = new ArrayList<ArrayList<String>>();\n    Scanner s = new Scanner(new File(\"c:\\\\stats.txt\")).useDelimiter(\"\\r\");\n    ArrayList<String> array = new ArrayList<String>();\n    int i = 0;\n    while (s.next() != null) {\n        String currentLine = s.next();\n        Scanner split = new Scanner(currentLine).useDelimiter(\"\\t\");\n        while (split.hasNext()) {\n            String token = split.nextToken();\n            System.out.print(token + \" \");\n            i++;\n        }\n        System.out.println(\"\\r\");\n    }\n    s.close();\n    return array;\n}\n```\nThis code uses a `while` loop to read the current line and a `StringTokenizer` to split the line into individual tokens. The loop continues until `split.hasNext()` returns false, which means that there are no more tokens to read. The `split.nextToken()` method is used to read each token, and the loop increments a counter `i` for each token. After all the tokens have been read, the loop prints the tokens and increments the counter. Finally, the loop closes the `StringTokenizer` and prints a new line."}
