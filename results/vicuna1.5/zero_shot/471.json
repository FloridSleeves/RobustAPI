USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: I need to iterate to the end of a column in Java on an Excel Sheet with Apache POI: :I am iterating down a column of values until it hits a blank. I need to gather the entire column and store it, and no other values. I've attempted to check for blank, null, 0, \"\", and CELL_TYPE_BLANK (int = 3), and I cannot get it to avoid a null pointer exception. Code snippet and error are below. What can I do? This is not the entire method or program, just the relevant piece.String s = list[i];//find the directory from the list array to locate the fileInputStream input = new FileInputStream(s);//create a new workbook object to hold the excel fileWorkbook wb = new XSSFWorkbook(input);//create an arbitrary starting locationint column = 2; //absolutely the correct numberint rownum = 10;//get the value from the first sheetorg.apache.poi.ss.usermodel.Sheet insheet = wb.getSheetAt(0);       //of the second colummRow row = insheet.getRow(rownum);//in the 11th row (arbitrary number used to reduce iterations and skip whitespace)Cell cell = row.getCell(column); System.out.println(\"Skimming sheet: \" + insheet.getSheetName());//iterate until the very end of the column is foundSystem.out.println(\"Cell value B\" + (rownum-1) +  \": \" + cell);//3 denotes CELL_TYPE_BLANKwhile (cell.getCellType() != 3 ) {    //go to the next location    //update to the next cell    System.out.println(\"Cell value B\" + rownum +  \": \" + cell);    row = insheet.getRow(rownum);    if(row.getCell(column).getCellType() != 3){        cell = row.getCell(column); //error occurs here, line 241    }    rownum++;}Exception in thread \"main\" java.lang.NullPointerException    at FileTest.skim(FileTest.java:241)    at FileTest.main(FileTest.java:121)\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "The issue with your code is that you are trying to access the cell value before the iteration has completed. You need to wait until the iteration is finished before accessing the cell value. To do this, you can use the `Iterator.next()` method to move to the next iteration and then access the cell value.\n\nHere's the modified code using `Iterator.next()`:\n```java\nIterator<Row> rowIterator = insheet.iterator();\nwhile (rowIterator.hasNext()) {\n    Row row = rowIterator.next();\n    int column = 2; // the column number\n    while (row.getCell(column) != null) {\n        System.out.println(\"Cell value B\" + (row.getRowNum() - 1) + \": \" + row.getCell(column));\n        rowIterator.next(); // move to the next row\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code uses an iterator to iterate over the rows in the sheet, and then iterates over the cells in each row until it reaches the end of the column. By using `Iterator.next()` to move to the next row after each iteration, you can avoid the null pointer exception."}
