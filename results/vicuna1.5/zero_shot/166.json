The following is my code.  The picture (test.bmp) does exist and is on the D drive but when I run this I get the applet window with nothing in it.  Can somebody tell me what I am missing to make the ImageIcon show?public class Form1 extends JApplet {    ImageIcon i;    public void init(){        i = new ImageIcon(\"D:\\test.bmp\");    }    public void paint(Graphics g){        i.paintIcon(this, g, 0, 0);    }}Thanks, Steve.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read.\n<<<code>>>: i = new ImageIcon(new FileInputStream(\"D:\\\\test.bmp\"));\n<<<explanation>>>: The issue with your code is that you are trying to load the image from a file on the D drive using a file path, but you need to use a FileInputStream to read the image from the file. By using the FileInputStream, you can read the contents of the file and create an ImageIcon from it."}
