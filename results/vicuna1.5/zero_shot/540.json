USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java 1.7: Sum of Iterable<T extends Number>: :I need to create a helper method which allows to create a sum of any Iterable<? extends Number>, because we have many vectors and require a fast method to determine the sum, so I created the following method: static Integer sum(Iterable<Integer> it) {    Integer result = 0;    for(T next : it) {        result += next;    }    return result; }This method only works for ints however, but we also have doubles and longs. Because you can't have two methods with the same signature (Our compiler thinks Integer sum(Iterable<Integer>) has the same signature as Double sum(Iterable<Double>).) I tried to write one method with generics.private static <T extends Number> T sum(Iterable<? extends T> it) {    T result;    for(T next : it) {        result += next;    }    return result;}However this method will not compile (reason: the operator += is undefined for Object, Object). What can I do here? I know in C++ you can overload operators, but not in Java. But every class which extends Number does overload the += operator. What can I do here?Thank you in advance.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.util.Iterator.next()\n<<<code>>>: private static <T extends Number> T sum(Iterable<? extends T> it) {    T result;    for(T next : it) {        result += next;    }    return result;}\n<<<explanation>>>: The issue with the original code is that the operator '+' is not defined for the Object class, which is the superclass of all classes in Java. One solution is to use the Iterator.next() method to retrieve the next element from the Iterable and add it to the result variable. This way, the operator '+' can be overloaded for the Number class and used with the result variable. However, this solution only works for the sum of a single type of Number, not for a combination of different types of Number."}
