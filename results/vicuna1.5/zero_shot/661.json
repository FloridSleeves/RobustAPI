The PrintWriter class is used to write the contents of the input stream to the output stream. The writer object is created by passing the file name as a parameter to the constructor of the PrintWriter class. The write() method is then used to write the contents of the input stream to the output stream. Finally, the close() method is called to close the writer object."}
