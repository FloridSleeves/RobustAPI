USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Read Java in as Hex: :I have tried to solve this but I keep coming up with stuff that is no help I'm sure this is easy (when you know how of course ;) ) What I would like to do is read in a file using a byte stream like below:while((read = in.read()) != -1){       //code removed to save space       Integer.toHexString(read);System.out.println(read);}When it prints out the Hex to the screen it will print out numbers fine e.g 3113120but when it comes to a hex code that should be 01 31 it will print 0 131. I want to read it in to a variable like you would see in a hex editor i.e 00 11 21 31 no single numbers as i need to scan the whole file and look for patterns which I know how to do I'm just stuck on this :/so in short i need a variabe to contain the two hex characters i.e int temp = 01 not int temp = 0 , I hope this all makes sense, I'm a little confused as it's 3am!If anyone knows how to do this I would be most greatful, p.s thanks for the help in advance this site has saved me loads of research and have learnt a lot!Many thanks.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read()\n<<<code>>>: while((read = in.read()) != -1){Integer.toHexString(read);System.out.println(read);}\n<<<explanation>>>: The issue with the code is that it is converting the byte read from the InputStream to an integer and then to a hex string, which results in a single hex character being printed instead of two. To fix this, you can create a temporary variable to store the two hex characters and then convert it to a string. Here's the modified code:\n```java\nwhile((read = in.read()) != -1){\n    int temp = (read & 0xFF) << 8;\n    temp |= (read & 0xFF);\n    String hex = Integer.toHexString(temp);\n    System.out.println(hex.substring(0, 2));\n}\n```\nThis code creates a temporary variable `temp` and sets it to the value of the current byte read from the InputStream. It then shifts the bits of the current byte to the left by 8 bits and sets the most significant bit to 1, effectively flipping the byte. This is done to ensure that the two hex characters are stored in the correct order. Finally, the code converts `temp` to a hex string and prints the first two characters."}
