USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Write mp3 file to disk while playing in Java: :I have an application playing remote MP3 files over HTTP using the JLayer/BasicPlayer libraries. I want to save the played mp3 files to disk without re-downloading them.This is the code using the JLayer based BasicPlayer for Playing the MP3 file.String mp3Url = \"http://ia600402.us.archive.org/6/items/Stockfinster.-DeadLinesutemos025/01_Push_Push.mp3\";URL url = new URL(mp3Url);URLConnection conn = url.openConnection();InputStream is = conn.getInputStream();BufferedInputStream bis = new BufferedInputStream(is);BasicPlayer player = new BasicPlayer();player.open(bis);player.play();How would I save the mp3 file to disk?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read.\n<<<code>>>: bis.skip(player.getDuration());player.close();FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(\"file.mp3\");fos.write(bis.readAllBytes());fos.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The code skips the remaining duration of the MP3 file by calling `bis.skip(player.getDuration())`. Then, it closes the `BufferedInputStream` and `FileOutputStream`. Finally, it writes all the bytes read from the `BufferedInputStream` to the `FileOutputStream` and closes it as well. This saves the played MP3 file to disk without re-downloading it."}
