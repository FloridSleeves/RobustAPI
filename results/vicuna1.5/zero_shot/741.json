USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Content-Disposition file extension not properly working on Firefox: :I have the following code on Spring Controller @RequestMapping(value = \"/download\", method = RequestMethod.POST) public void downloadActive(@RequestParam(value = \"type\") String offerType, HttpServletResponse response,            HttpSession session) throws Exception { StringBuilder b = new StringBuilder();...response.addHeader(\"Content-Disposition: \", \"attachment; filename=my\" + offerType + \"Offers.csv\");response.getWriter().write(b.toString());..}This code get executed when a download button from EXt Js is clicked. On chrome, it directly downloads the file as a *.csv format and when the user opens it, it will use Excel automatically to open the file, if they already have installed and this is the right behavior I wanted to have.However, on firefox, it prompts a save as window with open with and save options. If I use open with option, it tells me the filename is filename.csv but the type is chrome htm file. I haven't mentioned htm anywhere in my code and I dont know why its trying  to open it as htm instead of csv file. Once it tries to open it, it brings excel application and the contents are in a bad format.Is there a way to avoid this problem on firefox ?Thanks\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "The issue with the Content-Disposition file extension not working properly on Firefox is due to the browser's default behavior of associating certain file extensions with specific applications. In this case, Firefox is trying to open the file with an .htm extension, which is not specified in your code, with an HTML editor.\n\nTo avoid this problem on Firefox, you can use the Content-Type header to specify the correct file type. You can add the following line of code before setting the Content-Disposition header:\n\n<<<code>>>: response.setContentType(\"text/csv\");\n\nThis will tell the browser that the file being downloaded is a CSV file, and it should be opened with a spreadsheet application like Excel.\n\nAdditionally, you can try setting the Content-Disposition header to a value of \"attachment; filename=my\" + offerType + \"Offers.csv\" directly, without using a StringBuilder. This will also help Firefox to recognize the file type correctly:\n\n<<<code>>>: response.addHeader(\"Content-Disposition\", \"attachment; filename=my\" + offerType + \"Offers.csv\");\n\nExplanation:\nThe Content-Type header is used to specify the type of the file being sent in the response. In this case, we are sending a CSV file, so we need to set the Content-Type header to \"text/csv\". This will tell the browser that the file being downloaded is a CSV file and should be opened with a spreadsheet application like Excel.\n\nSetting the Content-Disposition header directly to \"attachment; filename=my\" + offerType + \"Offers.csv\" will also help Firefox to recognize the file type correctly. The \"attachment\" value specifies that the file should be downloaded and saved to the user's computer, and the \"filename\" value specifies the name of the file being downloaded.\n\nBy setting both the Content-Type and Content-Disposition headers correctly, you should be able to avoid the problem of Firefox prompting a save as window with open with and save options, and instead, the file should be downloaded and opened with the correct application, like Excel."}
