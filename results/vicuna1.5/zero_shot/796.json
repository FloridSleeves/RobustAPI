The PrintWriter class is part of the Java Printing API, which provides functionality for printing text and graphics to various output devices, such as the console, a file, or a printer. The write() method of the PrintWriter class is used to write the specified string to the output file. Finally, the close() method is called to close the PrintWriter and flush any remaining output to the file."}
