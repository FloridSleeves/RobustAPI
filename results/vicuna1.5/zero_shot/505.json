USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: return an Array which contains only odd integers: :Ok, so I have this problem where when given an Array arr, return an Array which contains only odd integers in the original order from arr.My code:public int [] youMakeMeOdd(int [] arr){   int[] odds;   odds = new int[arr.length];   for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)   {      if(arr[i] % 2 != 0)      {         odds[i] = arr[i];      }   }   return odds;}Few Testers:Expected...........................................................Run:youMakeMeOdd({1,2,3}) \u2192 {1, 3}.....................{1, 0, 3}youMakeMeOdd({2,1,3,5,7}) \u2192 {1, 3, 5, 7}.......{0, 1, 3, 5, 7}youMakeMeOdd({2,4,6,8}) \u2192 {}........................{0, 0, 0, 0}.I can't seem to figure out how to put a blank space there instead of 0's. Help appreciated, thanks :)\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<explanation>>>: The Iterator.next() method returns the next element in the iteration order of an iterator. In the given code, the iterator is being used to iterate over the elements of the input array. If the current element is odd, it is added to the odds array. If the current element is even, the next element in the iteration order is returned instead of the current element. This effectively skips over even elements and only adds odd elements to the output array."}
