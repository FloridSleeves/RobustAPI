USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Calculate the number of times a value changes within a collection: :For example suppose i have a list of objectsList<Integer> integers = new ArrayList<Integer>() {            {                add(Integer.valueOf(1));                add(Integer.valueOf(1));                add(Integer.valueOf(2)); // changed                add(Integer.valueOf(2));                add(Integer.valueOf(2));                add(Integer.valueOf(3)); // changed                add(Integer.valueOf(3));                add(Integer.valueOf(1)); // changed                add(Integer.valueOf(2)); // changed            }        };The above example should return the number 4 as the value has differed from the previous number 4 times. i presently have a cumbersome and difficult to maintain way that involves looping through the item and keeping track of the previous value and an accumulator to store the number of transitions.I'm interested to see if there's a java 8 streams way to solve this problem, or a more elegant solution than simply trudging through the collection and maintaining copies of the previous value.Thanks!\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: integers.stream().mapToInt(Iterator.next()).boxed().sum()\n<<<explanation>>>: This code uses Java 8 streams to calculate the number of times a value changes within the collection. The stream is created by calling the `stream()` method on the `List` object `integers`. The `mapToInt()` method is then called on the stream to convert the elements to their integer values. The `boxed()` method is used to convert the `IntStream` to a `Stream<Integer>`. Finally, the `sum()` method is called on the stream to calculate the total number of transitions."}
