USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java sorting map<String,String> by String prefix: :In Java.How do I sort a map by given string with numeric prefix.I get the map from properties file:1_aaa=bla12_bbb=bla23_ccc=bla34_ddd=bla4 ...10_jjj=bla1011_kkk=bla1112_lll=bla12I am loading the properties from file:FileInputStream is =new FileInputStream(new File(filePath));Properties prop = new Properties();prop.load(is);and after:SortedMap<Object, Object> sortedProperties new TreeMap<Object, Object>(prop);Now when using TreeMap --> '10_jjj' is the first element in the SortedMapand I want '1_aaa' to be the first.Any ideas?Thanks\nPlease using this api: SortedMap.firstKey.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: SortedMap.firstKey\n<<<code>>>: TreeMap<Object, Object> sortedProperties = new TreeMap<Object, Object>(prop);\n<<<explanation>>>: To sort a map by a given string with a numeric prefix, you can use the `TreeMap` class and specify the key that you want to use for sorting. In this case, you want to sort the map by the string prefix \"1\", so you can create a `TreeMap` with the `prop` object as the key set, like this:\n```\nTreeMap<Object, Object> sortedProperties = new TreeMap<Object, Object>(prop);\n```\nThis will create a `TreeMap` that sorts the keys by their natural order, which in this case is the order in which they appear in the \"1\\_aaa\" to \"10\\_jjj\" range. To get the first key of the sorted map, you can use the `firstKey` method, like this:\n```\nObject firstKey = sortedProperties.firstKey();\n```\nThis will return the first key of the sorted map, which in this case is \"1\\_aaa\"."}
