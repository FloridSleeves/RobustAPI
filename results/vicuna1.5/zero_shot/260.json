USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Retrieving keys of a hashmap: :Is there any way to retreive the keys of a hashmap other then using keyset? I have written the following code , I have a hashmap named map, it includes integer keys and double values :    Set<Integer> keys = sorted_map.keySet();    Object[] weel = new Object[keys.size()];    Iterator it = keys.iterator();    int l = 0;    while(it.hasNext())    {        weel[l] = it.next();    }Now I have an array that includes the keys of my map. but now I need to compare these keys with some integer. for example :                if(weel[1] == 5) but as the weel type is Object, I can not do the above and also I cannot cast it to int. how can I do this? is it possible?  \nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next()\n<<<code>>>: weel[l] = Iterator.next();\n<<<explanation>>>: By using the Iterator.next() method, you can retrieve the next element in the Iterator and assign it to the variable weel[l]. This will allow you to compare the keys of the hashmap with the integer value you are interested in. However, since the keys of the hashmap are Objects, you will need to cast the value of weel[l] to the appropriate data type before making the comparison. For example, if you want to compare the first key with the integer value 5, you can do: if(weel[0] == 5.0)"}
