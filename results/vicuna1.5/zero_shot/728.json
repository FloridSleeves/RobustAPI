Closed 10 years ago.for(i=0;i<10;i++){    String output = output + \"Result \"+ i +\" : \"+ ans +\"\\n\";   //ans from other logic    FileWriter f0 = new FileWriter(\"output.txt\");    f0.write(output);}but it doesn't work,please give some help for append or PrintWriter method, i have no idea how to use these methods.i need file output likeResult 1 : 45           //here 45 is ansResult 2 : 564856Result 3 : 879....Result 10 : 564thanks\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.io.PrintWriter\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"output.txt\");\nfor(i=0;i<10;i++){\nwriter.println(\"Result \" + i + \" : \" + ans);\n}\nwriter.close();\n\nExplanation:\nThis code uses the PrintWriter class to write the output to a file. The PrintWriter class is used to write text to a stream, which can be a file, a console, or a network connection. In this case, we are using it to write to a file named \"output.txt\".\n\nThe code first creates a new PrintWriter object and assigns it to the variable \"writer\". Then, it uses a for loop to iterate from 0 to 9. Inside the loop, it uses the println() method of the PrintWriter object to write the output to the file. The println() method adds a newline character at the end of the string, so the next result will be written on a new line. Finally, the code closes the PrintWriter object to ensure that any remaining data is written to the file."}
