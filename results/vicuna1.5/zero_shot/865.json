USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to append to AES encrypted file: :I'm writing some kind of logger that produces encrypted log-file. Unfortunately, cryptography is not my strong side. Now I can write to file several messages and then close file. Then i can open it, append some messages, close again and after decryption I see padding bytes in the middle of file. Is there any way to work with encrypted file without having to decrypt it every time I want to append some messages?EDIT: little more details. Current implementation utlizes CipherOutputStream. As i understand there's no way to seek using it.Can i use 'NoPadding' option if i will control that output data size is divisible by block size?\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: RandomAccessFile.write\n<<<code>>>: file.seek(file.length() - 10); // set position to the end of the file\nfile.write(\"new message\".getBytes()); // write new message to the file\nfile.write(\"more messages\".getBytes()); // write more messages to the file\nfile.close();\n\n<<<explanation>>>: Yes, you can use the 'NoPadding' option if you control that the output data size is divisible by the block size. However, since you are using CipherOutputStream, you cannot seek to a specific position in the file using the seek() method. Instead, you can use the write(byte[]) method to write the new message to the file. Then, you can use the close() method to close the file and ensure that any pending output is written to the file."}
