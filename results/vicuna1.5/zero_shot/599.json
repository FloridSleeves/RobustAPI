USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Handling large number of clickable rows: :I'm working on an Android project that has quite a few screens with upwards of 200 rows that will be clickable per screen.  The issue I am trying to figure out is how to make them all able to be clicked without adding 200 lines of TableRow r1 = (TableRow) findViewById(R.id.table_row_1);TableRow r2 = (TableRow) findViewById(R.id.table_row_2);TableRow r3 = (TableRow) findViewById(R.id.table_row_3);TableRow r4 = (TableRow) findViewById(R.id.table_row_4);r1.setOnClickListener(listener);r2.setOnClickListener(listener);r3.setOnClickListener(listener);r4.setOnClickListener(listener);Eventually the rows will take their id's and search the database for the value (I'm going to use each table row as a key for a value in the database to populate a column in the row) but for now I'm just trying to change the background color of the row when each one is clicked.Questions:How can I handle a large number of clickable rows without thousands of lines of redundant code?  Do I need to set an OnClickListener for each row or is there a better method that I am over looking?  Is there a way to do it in the XML maybe?\nPlease using this api: List.get.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: List.get\n<<<code>>>:\nList<TableRow> tableRows = new ArrayList<>();\nfor (int i = 1; i <= 200; i++) {\nTableRow tr = new TableRow(getApplicationContext());\ntr.setId(i);\ntableRows.add(tr);\n}\n\n// Add click listeners to all rows\nfor (TableRow tr : tableRows) {\ntr.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {\n@Override\npublic void onClick(View v) {\n// Change the background color of the row when clicked\nv.setBackgroundColor(Color.parseColor(\"#FFC0CB\"));\n}\n});\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>:\n\nTo handle a large number of clickable rows without thousands of lines of redundant code, you can create a list of TableRows in your code and add click listeners to all of them in a loop. This way, you only need to write the code for setting the click listener once, and it will be applied to all rows in the list.\n\nYou don't need to set an OnClickListener for each row, as doing so would result in a large amount of redundant code. Instead, you can use a loop to iterate through the list of TableRows and add the click listener to each one.\n\nIt is not possible to set the click listener in the XML, as the XML is used for defining the structure and appearance of the UI, not for adding event listeners. You will need to write the click listener code in your activity or fragment's Java code."}
