I am really stuck up to access terminal window of mac through java code programmatically. It would be really useful if you provide your valuable solutions to perform my task which i have been struggling to do for a past two days. I am also posting the piece of code that I am trying to do for your reference. Any kind of help would be helpful for mepublic class TerminalScript{    public static void main(String args[]){        try {            Process proc = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(\"/Users/xxxx/Desktop/NewFolder/keytool -genkey -v -keystore test.keystore -alias test -keyalg RSA -sigalg SHA1withRSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000\");             BufferedReader read = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(                    proc.getInputStream()));            try {                proc.waitFor();            } catch (InterruptedException e) {                System.out.println(e.getMessage());            }            while (read.ready()) {                System.out.println(read.readLine());            }        } catch (IOException e) {            System.out.println(e.getMessage());        }    }}Note: I have to run the command keytool -genkey -v -keystore test.keystore -alias test -keyalg RSA -sigalg SHA1withRSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 in terminal through java program.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.io.InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: read.readLine()\n<<<explanation>>>: To execute a command in the terminal from Java programmatically, you can use the Runtime.getRuntime().exec() method to create a process that runs the command in the background. To read the output of the command, you can use the BufferedReader class to read the input stream of the process. The read() method of the BufferedReader class reads a single character from the input stream and returns it as an integer. To read the entire line of output, you can use the readLine() method, which returns a string. In the given code, the read.readLine() method is used to read the output of the command and print it to the console."}
