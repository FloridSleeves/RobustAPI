Improve this question                    I have a large amount of data being sent from server to Javascript, which is taking quite a long time to load.I was wondering how I can implement compression at server and decompression in Javascript. I would appreciate any help.\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: String.getBytes()\n<<<code>>>:\n```java\nString jsonData = \"{\\\"name\\\":\\\"John\\\",\\\"age\\\":30,\\\"city\\\":\\\"New York\\\"}\";\nbyte[] jsonBytes = jsonData.getBytes();\n```\n<<<explanation>>>:\nThis code snippet demonstrates how to compress JSON data in Java using the `String.getBytes()` method. The method converts the given string to a byte array. In this case, the JSON data is stored in the `jsonData` variable and then converted to a byte array using the `getBytes()` method. The resulting byte array `jsonBytes` can be sent to the server for compression.\n\nTo decompress the JSON data in JavaScript, you can use the `at()` method to convert the byte array back to a string.\n```javascript\nconst jsonBytes = \"{\\\"name\\\":\\\"John\\\",\\\"age\\\":30,\\\"city\\\":\\\"New York\\\"}\".getBytes();\nconst jsonString = new TextDecoder().decode(jsonBytes);\nconsole.log(jsonString);\n```\nThis code snippet demonstrates how to decompress the JSON data in JavaScript using the `TextDecoder` class. The `getBytes()` method from Java is used to convert the JSON data to a byte array, which is then decoded using the `TextDecoder.decode()` method in JavaScript. The resulting string is stored in the `jsonString` variable and can be used for further processing."}
