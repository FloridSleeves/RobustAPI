The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Disabling Android Button depending on Permissions: :I have an android app that uses the permission \"CALL_PHONE\". This simple app would just contain a button that would use the call intent to call a specific number. I would like to install this app on both tablets and phone but when it is installed on the tablet, I would like the button to be disabled during runtime so errors wouldn't show when the user tries to call using the tablet without a call function. At the moment, I am using the setEnabled() and setClickable() method in my MainActivity.java and setting it to false when the user clicks on the button the first time. My question is whether the button can be disabled and the text changed during runtime or when the app is first opened (in a tablet) so the user wouldn't have to click the button first for it to show that the \"call\" button should be disabled and unclickable?\nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Activity.setContentView\n<<<code>>>: setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n<<<explanation>>>: This code sets the layout for the main activity using the setContentView() method. It is called in the onCreate() method of the activity class. By setting the layout, you can customize the UI of the activity, including the button that will be used to make calls. To disable the button on tablets, you can check for the presence of the \"CALL\\_PHONE\" permission at runtime and disable the button if it is not present. You can also check for the device type (tablet or phone) and disable the button on tablets."}
