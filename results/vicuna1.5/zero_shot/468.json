USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Deleting from Arraylist: :I wanted to optimize the code a bit. All trying to do is remove the product from the array.When I call the method deleteProduct(prod.getId()), it should delete product that I added first.I can use the for loop, then how would delete the product in the array.Any pointers, please?public void deleteProduct(int productId) throws ProductNotFoundException {    Iterator<Product> it = allProducts.iterator();    Product p= null;    int pid = productId;    int i = 0;    if (!allProducts.isEmpty()) {        while(it.hasNext()){            p= it.next();            i= allProducts.indexOf(p);            if (p.getId().equals(productId)){                i= allProducts.indexOf(p);                allProducts.remove(i);                System.out.println(\"Successfully removed the product \" + pid);                return;            }        }    }           throw new ProductNotFoundException (\"No Such Product\");}\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: allProducts.iterator().next()\n<<<explanation>>>: The code can be optimized by using the Iterator.next() method to retrieve the Product object at the current position of the Iterator. This will allow you to delete the product from the ArrayList without using a for loop."}
