To use the PrintWriter class to write to the file, you need to create a PrintWriter object and pass it the FileWriter object that was created.\n\nHere is an example of how you can modify the code to use the PrintWriter class to write to the file:\n```\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.Scanner;\nimport java.io.PrintWriter;\nimport java.io.FileWriter;\n\npublic class ReadingUserInput {\n    public static String gender;\n    public static int motherHeight;\n    public static int fatherHeight;\n    static Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        try {\n            FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(\"height.txt\");\n            PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(fw);\n            pw.write(\"Gender: \" + gender + \"\\n\");\n            pw.write(\"Mother Height: \" + motherHeight + \"\\n\");\n            pw.write(\"Father Height: \" + fatherHeight + \"\\n\");\n            pw.close();\n            System.out.println(\"Data written to the file\");\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            System.out.println(\"File not found\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code creates a PrintWriter object and passes it the FileWriter object that was created. It then uses the write() method of the PrintWriter object to write the data to the file.\n\nRegarding the issue of the file being empty when you open it, it could be because the file is not being closed properly. In the code you provided, the FileWriter object is closed in a try-catch block, but the PrintWriter object is not closed. To fix this, you should close the PrintWriter object as well.\n```\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.Scanner;\nimport java.io.PrintWriter;\nimport java.io.FileWriter;\n\npublic class ReadingUserInput {\n    public static String gender;\n    public static int motherHeight;\n    public static int fatherHeight;\n    static Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        try {\n            FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(\"height.txt\");\n            PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(fw);\n            pw.write(\"Gender: \" + gender + \"\\n\");\n            pw.write(\"Mother Height: \" + motherHeight + \"\\n\");\n            pw.write(\"Father Height: \" + fatherHeight + \"\\n\");\n            pw.close();\n            System.out.println(\"Data written to the file\");\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            System.out.println(\"File not found\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code closes the PrintWriter object after it is done writing to the file."}
