The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: return double value of string passed: :Create a method called parseEqn which will receive 1 String variable and return the double value of the expression passed to it. parseEqn(\"123+23\") \u2192 146.0parseEqn(\"3+5\") \u2192 8.0parseEqn(\"3-5\") \u2192 -2.0this is what i have so far:public double parseEqn(String str) {   StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(str,\"+-/*%\",true);   String first = st.nextToken();   String op = st.nextToken();   String second = st.nextToken();   double ff = Double.parseDouble(first);   double ss = Double.parseDouble(second);   double answer;   if (op.equals(\"+\")){   answer= ff+ss;}   else if (op.equals(\"-\")){   answer= ff-ss;}   else if (op.equals(\"/\")){   answer= ff/ss;}   else (op.equals(\"*\")){   answer= ff*ss;}   return answer;I keep getting the error Syntax error, insert \"AssignmentOperator ArrayInitializer\" to complete ArrayInitializerAssignement....what does that mean?what do i need to do to my loop in order for it to work? i can manually input say ff+ss and the method will work just fine, but i cant seem to create a loop to check which operator is in the string for me and then pass the answer back. note: im on a time crunch and would really appreciate help. a straight forward answer/explanation would be so helpful... not those super vague \"oh its not hard...\" type of thing... \nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.util.StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(str,\"+-/*%\",true); st.nextToken();\n<<<explanation>>>: The error message \"Syntax error, insert \"AssignmentOperator ArrayInitializer\" to complete ArrayInitializerAssignement\" means that the code is trying to use the nextToken() method before the first token has been properly retrieved. To fix this, you need to move the line \"String first = st.nextToken();\" to before the if-else statements. This will ensure that the first token is properly retrieved before the rest of the code is executed."}
