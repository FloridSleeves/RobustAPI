USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Appending .txt file is erasing everything: :import java.io.FileWriter;import java.io.PrintWriter;public class DemoPrint {    public static void main (String args []) {        try{            PrintWriter coolFile = new PrintWriter(\"c:\\\\JavaIO\\\\cool.txt\");            FileWriter file = new FileWriter(\"c:\\\\JavaIO\\\\cool.txt\", true);            coolFile.println(\"Why isn't this adding another line?\");            coolFile.close();        }        catch (Exception e) {            System.out.println(\"Error\");        }}    }So I'm new to programming/java and I'm trying to open this file and append the data and add another line but for some reason the data is just being erased and overwritten with whatever I have in the coolFile.println(\"\").Can anyone help me out on this? I know its probably a easy fix... I'm learning.. Thank you!\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter coolFile = new PrintWriter(\"c:\\\\JavaIO\\\\cool.txt\"); coolFile.write(\"Why isn't this adding another line?\\n\"); coolFile.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The issue with the previous code is that the PrintWriter object is being closed inside the try-catch block, which means that the file is being closed before the data is written to it. This is causing the data to be erased. To fix this, the PrintWriter object should be closed outside of the try-catch block, after the data has been written to the file. Additionally, the \"\\n\" at the end of the line needs to be escaped with a backslash, as it is a special character in Java."}
