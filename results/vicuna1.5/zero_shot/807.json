USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to add a UTF-8 BOM in Java?: :I have a Java stored procedure which fetches record from the table using Resultset object and creates a CS Vfile.BLOB retBLOB = BLOB.createTemporary(conn, true, BLOB.DURATION_SESSION);retBLOB.open(BLOB.MODE_READWRITE);OutputStream bOut = retBLOB.setBinaryStream(0L);ZipOutputStream zipOut = new ZipOutputStream(bOut);PrintStream out = new PrintStream(zipOut,false,\"UTF-8\");out.write('\\ufeff');out.flush();zipOut.putNextEntry(new ZipEntry(\"filename.csv\"));while (rs.next()){    out.print(\"\\\"\" + rs.getString(i) + \"\\\"\");    out.print(\",\");}out.flush();zipOut.closeEntry();zipOut.close();retBLOB.close();return retBLOB;But the generated CSV file doesn't show the correct German character. Oracle database also has a NLS_CHARACTERSET value of UTF8.Please suggest.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "To add a UTF-8 BOM in Java, you can use the `PrintWriter.write` method to write the UTF-8 BOM (byte sequence) at the beginning of the file. You can modify your code as follows:\n\n<<<code>>>:\n```java\nPrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(zipOut, true);\nout.write('\\ufeff');\nout.flush();\nzipOut.putNextEntry(new ZipEntry(\"filename.csv\"));\nwhile (rs.next()) {\n    out.print(\"\\\"\" + rs.getString(i) + \"\\\"\");\n    out.print(\",\");\n}\nout.flush();\nzipOut.closeEntry();\nzipOut.close();\nretBLOB.close();\nreturn retBLOB;\n```\nExplanation:\nThe `PrintWriter` class is used to write the contents of the file. The `true` parameter passed to the constructor of `PrintWriter` specifies that the writer should be used for writing binary data. The `write` method is used to write the UTF-8 BOM at the beginning of the file. The `flush` method is used to ensure that the BOM is written to the file before moving on to the next entry. The `putNextEntry` method is used to specify the name of the file and the `closeEntry` method is used to close the file entry. Finally, the `close` method is used to close the `PrintWriter` and the `BLOB` object.\n\nWith this modification, the generated CSV file should have the correct German characters."}
