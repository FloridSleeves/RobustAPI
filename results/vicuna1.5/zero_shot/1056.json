{"api": "StringTokenizer.nextToken", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Splitting strings based on a delimiter: :I am trying to break apart a very simple collection of strings that come in the forms of0|010|1530|55etc etc. Essentially numbers that are seperated by pipes.When I use java's string split function with .split(\"|\"). I get somewhat unpredictable results. white space in the first slot, sometimes the number itself isn't where I thought it should be.Can anybody please help and give me advice on how I can use a reg exp to keep ONLY the integers?I was asked to give the code trying to do the actual split. So allow me to do that in hopes to clarify further my problem :)String temp = \"0|0\";String splitString = temp.split(\"|\");results\\n0| 0I am trying to get00only. Forever grateful for any help ahead of time :)\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String temp = \"0|0\"; StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(temp, \"|\"); String splitString = st.nextToken();\n<<<explanation>>>: This code uses the StringTokenizer class to split the input string based on the delimiter \"|\". The nextToken() method is called on the StringTokenizer object to retrieve the next token (i.e., the split string) and assign it to the variable splitString. The input string temp is first converted to a String object before being passed to the StringTokenizer constructor."}
