USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: sorting lines of a text file by number present and output the whole lines in descending order: :I am trying to make a high score system by saving the names and score to a textfile using this code.String text = name.getText().toString() + \" \" + score.getText().toString();            appendLog(text);        }    });}public void appendLog(String text){          File logFile = new File(\"sdcard/logger.file\");   if (!logFile.exists())   {      try      {         logFile.createNewFile();      }       catch (IOException e)      {         // TODO Auto-generated catch block         e.printStackTrace();      }   }   try   {      //BufferedWriter for performance, true to set append to file flag      BufferedWriter buf = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(logFile, true));       buf.append(text);      buf.newLine();      buf.close();   }   catch (IOException e)   {      // TODO Auto-generated catch block      e.printStackTrace();   }Is there a way for me to sort the scores present in each line and output name with its corresponding score? Can anyone please help me how to do it? thank you.\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"sdcard/logger.file\"));\nString line = reader.readLine();\nwhile (line != null) {\nString[] nameAndScore = line.split(\" \");\nint score = Integer.parseInt(nameAndScore[1]);\n// sort the scores in descending order\nCollections.sort(Arrays.asList(nameAndScore), Collections.reverseOrder());\n// output the name and score\nSystem.out.println(nameAndScore[0] + \" \" + score);\nline = reader.readLine();\n}\nreader.close();\n\nExplanation:\n\nTo sort the scores present in each line, we can use the `Collections.sort()` method with a `Comparator` that compares the scores in descending order. We can use the `split()` method to split each line into name and score, and then parse the score as an integer. We can then store the name and score in an array, sort the array in descending order using `Collections.reverseOrder()`, and output the name and score. We repeat this process for each line in the file, reading the next line with `reader.readLine()` until there are no more lines left. Finally, we close the reader with `reader.close()`."}
