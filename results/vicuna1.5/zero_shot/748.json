(1 answer)                            Closed last year.I'm trying to create a simple program that will output a string to a text file. Using code I found here, I have put together the following code: import java.io.*;public class Testing {  public static void main(String[] args) {    File file = new File (\"file.txt\");    file.getParentFile().mkdirs();    PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(file);    printWriter.println (\"hello\");    printWriter.close();         }} J-grasp throws me the following error:  ----jGRASP exec: javac -g Testing.javaTesting.java:10: error: unreported exception FileNotFoundException; must be caught or declared to be thrown    PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(file);                              ^1 error ----jGRASP wedge2: exit code for process is 1.Since I'm pretty new to Java, I have no idea what this means. Can anybody point me in the right direction? \nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write()\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(file); printWriter.write(\"hello\"); printWriter.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The error message \"error: unreported exception FileNotFoundException; must be caught or declared to be thrown\" means that a FileNotFoundException was thrown in the code, but it was not caught or declared to be thrown. This means that the program terminated abruptly without handling the exception.\n\nTo fix this error, you need to catch the FileNotFoundException or declare it to be thrown. You can do this by adding a try-catch block around the code that creates the PrintWriter object and writes to the file. Here's an example of how you can modify the code to catch the FileNotFoundException:\n\nPrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(file);\ntry {\nprintWriter.write(\"hello\");\n} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {\ne.printStackTrace(); // print the stack trace of the exception\n} finally {\nprintWriter.close(); // close the PrintWriter regardless of whether an exception was thrown or not\n}"}
