But for some reason this keeps lagging out my game and running it out of memory. Why is this happening and how do I fix this?I create the list like this:List<Snake> snake = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<Snake>();This is where I create new objects and remove them in a forloop:public void snake() {    snake.add(new Snake(ball.getX(), ball.getY()));    currentTime++;    for(Snake currentSnake: snake) {        if(currentSnake.creationDate < SnakeLength){            currentSnake.Update();        } else {            Gdx.app.log(\"SnakeLength\" + SnakeLength, \"CreationDate\" + currentSnake.creationDate);            snake.remove(currentSnake);        }    }}This is how my snake class looks like:public class Snake{    float width = Gdx.graphics.getWidth();    float height = Gdx.graphics.getHeight();    float screenwidth = width/270;    float screenheight = height/480;    public float x;    public float y;    public int creationDate;    ShapeRenderer shapeRenderer;    SpriteBatch batch;    public boolean active = false;    public Snake(float x, float y) {        shapeRenderer = new ShapeRenderer();        batch = new SpriteBatch();        this.x = x;        this.y = y;    }    public void Update() {        batch.begin();        shapeRenderer.begin(ShapeType.Filled);        shapeRenderer.setColor(new Color(1, 1, 1, 0.2f));        shapeRenderer.circle(x + 8*screenwidth, y + 8*screenheight, 6*screenheight);        shapeRenderer.end();        batch.end();        creationDate++;    }}\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "The issue with your code is that you are creating new objects in the `snake()` method and adding them to the `snake` list, but you are not removing the old objects from the list when their `creationDate` value exceeds `SnakeLength`. This is causing the list to grow in size and eventually run out of memory.\n\nTo fix this issue, you need to modify the `snake()` method to remove the old objects from the list when their `creationDate` value exceeds `SnakeLength`. You can use an iterator to iterate through the list and remove the old objects.\n\nHere's an example of how you can modify the `snake()` method to use an iterator:\n```scss\npublic void snake() {\n    snake.add(new Snake(ball.getX(), ball.getY()));\n    currentTime++;\n    Iterator<Snake> iterator = snake.iterator();\n    while (iterator.hasNext()) {\n        Snake currentSnake = iterator.next();\n        if (currentSnake.creationDate < SnakeLength) {\n            currentSnake.Update();\n        } else {\n            iterator.remove();\n            Gdx.app.log(\"SnakeLength\" + SnakeLength, \"CreationDate\" + currentSnake.creationDate);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this modified version of the `snake()` method, we create an iterator for the `snake` list using the `iterator()` method. We then use a while loop to iterate through the list and remove the old objects when their `creationDate` value exceeds `SnakeLength`.\n\nBy using an iterator, you can avoid creating a new list and iterating through it, which can be more memory-efficient."}
