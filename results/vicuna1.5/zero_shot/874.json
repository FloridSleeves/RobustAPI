{"api": "SQLiteDatabase.query", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Showing strings from a SQL file in java: :I have a SQL file with some data that I want to show in my app, the data will be shown in a list view.I want to include the SQL file in the apk.  I have three questions:Is including the SQL file with the apk is the best option or is there a better one?If putting it in the apk is the best option, where do I put it?How do I get the strings from the file and show them in the app?Thanks for the help!\nPlease using this api: SQLiteDatabase.query.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: SQLiteDatabase.query()\n<<<code>>>: String[] projection = new String[]{SqliteHelper.COLUMN_NAME_NAME, SqliteHelper.COLUMN_NAME_VALUE};\nString selection = SqliteHelper.COLUMN_NAME_NAME + \" LIKE ?\";\nString[] selectionArgs = new String[]{ \"%\" + searchTerm + \"%\" };\nCursor cursor = db.query(SqliteHelper.TABLE_NAME_ITEMS, projection, selection, selectionArgs, null, null, null);\nint count = cursor.getCount();\nif (count > 0) {\nList<Item> items = new ArrayList<>();\nwhile (cursor.moveToNext()) {\nItem item = new Item(cursor.getString(cursor.getColumnIndex(SqliteHelper.COLUMN_NAME_NAME)), cursor.getString(cursor.getColumnIndex(SqliteHelper.COLUMN_NAME_VALUE)));\nitems.add(item);\n}\ncursor.close();\nadapter.setData(items);\n} else {\nadapter.setData(null);\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: This code uses the SQLiteDatabase.query() method to query the database for items that match the search term. The method returns a Cursor object that contains the results of the query. The code then loops through the cursor and extracts the names and values of the items, creating an Item object for each one. The Item objects are then added to a List and passed to the adapter to be displayed in the ListView. The code also checks if the cursor has any rows, if not it sets the data of the adapter to null."}
