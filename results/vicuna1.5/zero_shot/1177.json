The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Returning the rest of the string with stringtokenizer: :Looked for over an hour and cannot seem to find a way to implement this.I have a stringtokenizer object that is breaking apart a string(a mathematical expression). After reaching a certain point I want to be able to just take what is left of the string after the current position(I want to then use it recursively)If I do StringTokenizer sTokenizer = new StringTokenizer(expression);//operations with some of the tokens hereSystem.out.println(sTokenizer.nextToken());it will delimit by spaces.I triedsTokenizer.nextToken(null)but that just throws a null pointer exception.I know I could just put some random string in the parameter that is unlikely to show up in the expression, but that isn't ideal.If I were implementing this with substringsexpression.substring(currentposition)would work, but I need stringtokenizer.In short, I'm trying to figure out a way to retrieve the remainder of a string(that is being used by stringtokenizer) as a single token.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: StringTokenizer sTokenizer = new StringTokenizer(expression);\nsTokenizer.nextToken();\nString remainder = sTokenizer.nextToken();\n<<<explanation>>>: To retrieve the remainder of the string after the current position using StringTokenizer, you can call the nextToken() method twice. The first call will return the next token, and the second call will return the remainder of the string. However, since the nextToken() method consumes the next token, you need to store the first token returned by the method in a variable before calling it again. In this case, you can use the expression variable to store the first token, and then use the remainder variable to store the second token."}
