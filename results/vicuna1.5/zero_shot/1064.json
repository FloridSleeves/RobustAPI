The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: read from file and write some parts in another file: :I have to read from a text file and format the input. I'm new to java reading from files, and I don't know how to work with just some parts of what I readHere is the initial file: http://pastebin.com/D0paWtAdAnd I have to write in another file the following output:Average,Joe,44,31,18,12,9,10I've managed just to take everything from the file and print it to output. I would need help just in taking the output I need and print it to the screen. Any help is appreciated.This is what I wrote up to now:public class FileParsing {public static Stringread(String filename) throws IOException {BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"C:\\\\Users\\\\Bogdi\\\\Desktop\\\\example.txt\"));String s;StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();while((s = in.readLine())!= null)   sb.append(s + \"\\n\");in.close();return sb.toString();}\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.util.StringTokenizer\n<<<code>>>: StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(sb.toString(), \",\");st.nextToken();String output = st.nextToken() + \",\" + st.nextToken() + \",\" + st.nextToken() + \",\" + st.nextToken() + \",\" + st.nextToken() + \",\" + st.nextToken() + \",\" + st.nextToken();System.out.println(output);\n<<<explanation>>>: To extract the desired output from the input string, we can use the StringTokenizer class in Java. The StringTokenizer class splits a string into a sequence of tokens based on a specified delimiter. In this case, we want to split the input string by the comma character (\",\"). We create a new StringTokenizer object with the input string and the comma character as the delimiter. Then, we call the nextToken() method twice to get the first and second names, and the nextToken() method three times to get the third, fourth, and fifth names. Finally, we concatenate the comma separator with each name to form the desired output string, and print it to the console using the println() method."}
