USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Understanding piece of code written in PHP using Zend framework: :I am java developer and I am trying to use one WEB Service API (ticketutils) where they have explained two examples first one with PHP and second one with C#. Unfortunately I am not able to get any of them. I have mentioned PHP example below.  public function GenerateSignature($Secret,$PathAndQuery)     {       return base64_encode(\\Zend_Crypt_Hmac::compute($Secret, 'sha256',       $PathAndQuery, \\Zend_Crypt_Hmac::BINARY));     }Can anyone please explain me how can I achieve the same with Java code? I have tried below code but it seems it's not generating proper outcome. public static String generateSignature(String secrete, String pathAndQuery){        String encoded = null;        try {            MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\");            md.update(secrete.getBytes(\"UTF-8\"));            md.update(pathAndQuery.getBytes(\"UTF-8\"));            byte[] digest = md.digest();            encoded = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(digest);        } catch (Exception e) {            e.printStackTrace();        }        return encoded;    }NOTE : I have used Java-8 for while writing above code. \nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.security.MessageDigest\n<<<code>>>: MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\").update(secret.getBytes()).digest().getBytes()\n<<<explanation>>>: The Java code to generate a signature using the SHA-256 algorithm and the given secret and pathAndQuery strings can be achieved using the `java.security.MessageDigest` API. The `MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\")` method returns an instance of the SHA-256 message digest algorithm, which is used to compute the hash of the input data. The `update` method of the digest instance is used to update the digest with the input data in bytes format. The `digest` method returns the hash value as a byte array. Finally, the `getBytes()` method is used to convert the byte array to a string."}
