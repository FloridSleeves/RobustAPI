The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Ignoring hyphens while using Scanner: :Is there any easy way to ignore hyphens while using scanner? I have a program that will allow you to buy an area (2D array) so if the user want to buy area 3-6, I want scanner to put the number before the hyphen in row and the number after in column. Is there any easy way to do this?String[][] buyer = new String[10][15];int row;int column; System.out.print(\"Specify which area you want to buy: \");row = scan.nextInt();column = scan.nextInt();String name;System.out.print(\"Name of the buyer: \");name = scan.nextLine();buyer[row][colum] = name\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(scan.nextLine());\nint row = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\nint column = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\nString name = st.nextToken();\nbuyer[row][column] = name;\n\nExplanation:\nTo ignore hyphens while using scanner, we can use the StringTokenizer class. We create a new StringTokenizer object by passing the input string (which is the user input) to the constructor. Then, we call the nextToken() method twice to get the row and column numbers, ignoring the hyphens. Finally, we assign the name to the buyer array."}
