USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Try/catch block with a while statement, used to handle socket data, does not continue. No obvious errors (I think): :This is my main class - Main.java. Used to control requester but added for completeness.import java.io.IOException;import HtmlRequester.Requester;public class Main {public static void main(String[] args) {    Requester rq = new Requester(\"www.google.co.za\", 80);    try {        rq.htmlRequest();    } catch (IOException e) {        e.printStackTrace();        System.err.println(\"Connection failed.\");        System.exit(-1);    }}}This is requester.java, edited for shortness.package HtmlRequester;import java.net.*;import java.io.*;public class Requester{    Socket httpSocket = null;    PrintWriter out = null;    BufferedReader in = null;    String server;    int port;public void setAttributes(String server, int port){    this.server = server;    this.port = port;}public String htmlRequest(String server, int port) throws IOException{    try {        httpSocket = new Socket(InetAddress.getByName(server), port);        out = new PrintWriter(httpSocket.getOutputStream(), true);        in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(                httpSocket.getInputStream()));    } catch (UnknownHostException e) {        System.err.println(\"Don't know about host: \" + server);        System.exit(-1);    } catch (IOException e) {        System.err.println(\"Couldn't get I/O for \"                           + \"the connection to: \" + server + \"on port \" + port);        System.exit(-1);    }    finally{        System.out.println(\"Successful connection.\");    }    out.println(compileRequestText());    out.println(\"\");    String t;    String ret = \"\";    System.out.println(\"wait...\");    try {        while((t = in.readLine()) != null)        {        ret.concat(t);        System.out.println(t);        }        System.out.println(\"done\");    }    catch(SocketException e)    {        System.err.println(\"Socket Exception :(\");    }    System.out.println(\"Succesful data transfer.\");    out.close();    in.close();    httpSocket.close();    return ret;}private String compileRequestText(){    String ret = \"GET / HTTP/1.1\";    return ret;}}What happens is that the second try-catch block in Request.java, the block that contains:while((t = in.readLine()) != null)Will execute, and the response from server is successfully displayed. However, after the response is displayed, the loop will stop executing, the code does not move ahead to the finally block. The program does not seem to continue after that while loop. Anyone have any idea why?i.e.,             System.out.println(\"done\");is never reached, with no exceptions or compiler errors being thrown.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.io.InputStream.read()\n<<<code>>>: rq.htmlRequest();\n<<<explanation>>>: The issue with the code is that the while loop in the try-catch block is blocking the execution of the program, and the program is not moving ahead to the finally block. This is because the while loop is waiting for input from the server, and once the input is received, the loop terminates, and the program does not continue with the next statement. The method InputStream.read() is used to read data from the input stream, and in this case, it is being used in the while loop to read the response from the server. Once the response is received, the loop terminates, and the program does not continue with the next statement, causing the issue."}
