USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I stop XmlSerializer transforming &#234; to &amp;#234; in an attribute?: :I have the following DOM    <row>        <link href=\"B&#252;ro.txt\" target=\"_blank\">            my link        </link>    </row>When I serialize it to a file using the Java XmlSerializer it comes out like this:    <row>        <link href=\"B&amp;#252;ro.txt\" target=\"_blank\">            my link        </link>    </row>Is there any way to control the way XmlSerializer handles escaping in attributes? Should I be doing this differently any way?UpdateI should also say that I am using jre 1.6. I had been using jre 1.5 until recently and I am pretty sure that it was serialized 'correctly' (i.e. the '&' was not escaped)ClarificationThe DOM is created programmatically. Here is an example:        Document doc = createDocument();        Element root = doc.createElement(\"root\");        doc.appendChild(root);        root.setAttribute(\"test1\", \"&#234;\");        root.setAttribute(\"test2\", \"\u00fc\u00f6\u00e4\");        root.appendChild(doc.createTextNode(\"&#234;\"));        StringWriter sw = new StringWriter();        serializeDocument(doc, sw);        System.out.println(sw.toString());My solutionI didn't really want to do this because it involved a fair amount of code change and testing but I decided to move the attribute data into a CDATA element. Problem solved avoided.\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "The `String.getBytes()` method returns an array of bytes representing the UTF-8 encoded form of the specified string."}
