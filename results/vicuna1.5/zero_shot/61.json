The BufferedReader.readLine() method can be used to read a single line from a file. The code above creates a BufferedReader object and reads the first line of the file \"path/to/file.java\". The line is then stored in the variable \"line\". This process can be repeated for each line in the file to ensure that each line ends with a newline character."}
