USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Conditionally Adding String in StringTokenizer: :I am currently stuck with a very simple yet confusing issue while using StringTokenizer. What I am trying to achieve is below:I have a URL String as:http://xxx:port/jira/rest/api/2/search?jql=project='TP' AND(status='Ready for INT Deployment' or status = 'Ready for UAT Deployment')Above is the base string. Now I want to dynamically add more query parameters to the above URL as below: \"AND (key=NN-1234 OR key=NN-4321 OR key=NN-65343.....)\"Here is my code:private String getPartialIssueList() {    String listFromProperties = getPropertyValue(\"propagateList\");    StringTokenizer token = new StringTokenizer(listFromProperties, \",\");    StringBuilder partialListString = new StringBuilder();    partialListString.append(\" AND key=\");    while (token.hasMoreElements()) {        partialListString.append(token.nextElement() + \" OR key=\" + token.nextElement());    }    return partialListString.toString();}Somehow this only works if I have 2 inputs. What I want is, after the base url an \"AND\" should be added followed by opening brackets \"(\" and then key=\"value from properties\", value 2 from properties, value 3 from properties, then closing brace \")\". Irrespective of how many JIRA ID's I have in properties file, it should keep on adding \"OR key=NN-5432 OR key=\"NN-9875\" and so on..This is the output I am looking for:http://xxx:port/jira/rest/api/2/search?jql=project='TP' AND (status='Ready for INT Deployment' or status = 'Ready for UAT Deployment') AND (key=NN-09876 OR key=NN-09873 OR key=NN-09376 OR key=NN-02876)Currently values for propagateList in the properties file ispropagateList=\"NN-09876\",\"NN-65432\",\"NN-65430\"Can someone please help out on this?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: StringTokenizer token = new StringTokenizer(listFromProperties, \",\");\nwhile (token.hasMoreElements()) {\npartialListString.append(token.nextToken() + \" OR key=\" + token.nextToken());\n}\nreturn partialListString.toString();\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The issue with the given code is that it is only adding two query parameters to the URL. To dynamically add more query parameters, we need to use the nextToken() method of the StringTokenizer class instead of the nextElement() method. The nextToken() method returns the next token in the string, which includes the \"key=\" and \"value\" parts separated by an equals sign. We can use a while loop to iterate through the list of JIRA IDs in the properties file and add each ID as a separate query parameter to the URL. The final URL will have an \"AND\" operator followed by the base URL, an opening bracket, a list of query parameters, and a closing bracket."}
