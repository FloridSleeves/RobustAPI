I currently have it filed with random numbers within the correct range, but I just cant think of a solution to have non duplicates. How could i do this using very basic java methods? I have not yet learned anything such as arraylists, or anything like that, only the very basic methods. \nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: Iterator iterator = array.iterator();\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\nint randomNumber = (int) iterator.next();\narray[row][column] = randomNumber;\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: To fill a 2D array with random non-duplicate numbers in Java, you can use the Iterator.next() method to get a random number from the array and then check if the number already exists in the same row or column using the hasNext() and next() methods of the Iterator. If the number does not exist, it will be added to the array. This process will be repeated for all the elements in the array until all the elements are filled with random numbers."}
