{"api": "StringTokenizer.nextToken", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Using StringTokenizer to make pair of words: :I was stuck in a situation, where I have to make pairs of words from a string of line using StringTokenzier. But I am not sure how that class can give me that functionality. Example : Input : \"USA UK USSR China\"Output : \"USA UK\" \"UK USSR\" \"USSR China\"StringTokenizer has only hasMoreElements () and hasMoreTokens(), how can we iterate over it to achieve the desired output ? \nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(\"USA UK USSR China\");\nwhile (st.hasMoreTokens()) {\nString word1 = st.nextToken();\nString word2 = st.nextToken();\nSystem.out.println(\"USA UK \" + word1 + \" \" + word2);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The StringTokenizer class has the nextToken() method that returns the next token in the input string. We can use a while loop to iterate over the tokens returned by the nextToken() method and create pairs of words by storing the next token in one variable and the previous token in another. The hasMoreTokens() method returns true as long as there are more tokens in the input string, so we can use it to check if there are more pairs of words to be created."}
