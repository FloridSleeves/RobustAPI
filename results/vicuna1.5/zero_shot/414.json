The main issue is as we can successfully switch between windows in firefox or IE windows, here I am not able to switch between windows based on handles. Please help me. Below is the code I have tried so far.    System.setProperty(\"phantomjs.binary.path\", file.getAbsolutePath());            driver = new PhantomJSDriver();      driver.get(application url);              driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(100, TimeUnit.SECONDS);    WebElement txtUsername = driver.findElement(By.id(\"it_C_C5\"));            txtUsername.sendKeys(\"sreenis\");            WebElement txtPassword = driver.findElement(By.id(\"it_C_C7\"));    txtPassword.sendKeys(\"sreeni\");    WebElement btnLogin = driver.findElement(By.id(\"ic_C_C8\"));            btnLogin.click();    Thread.sleep(10000);    String winTitle = \"Role profile selection\";    boolean bool = switchWindow(winTitle);    if (bool){        System.out.println(\"Page title is: \" + driver.getTitle());        driver.quit();         }    else {        System.out.println(\"Switch to window '\" + winTitle + \"' failed!\");        driver.quit();    } public static boolean switchWindow(String windowtitle){    String mainWindowsHandle = driver.getWindowHandle();    Set<String> handles = driver.getWindowHandles();    System.out.println(handles.size());    for(String winHandle : handles){                    driver.switchTo().window(winHandle);        System.out.println(driver.getTitle());        if(driver.getTitle().toLowerCase().equals(windowtitle)){            return true;        }               }    driver.switchTo().window(mainWindowsHandle);    return false;}When I tried to print the window titles in collection, it is only printing the parent window and not the other windows. I am not able to guess what is happening since nothing can be seen and it is headless testing. Please suggest me is there any other way so that I can test the app with many browser windows.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<explanation>>>: The code you provided is not using the Iterator.next API, but rather the PhantomJSDriver API to switch between browser windows. The issue you are facing is that the code is not able to switch to the newly opened browser window. One possible solution is to use the `driver.switchTo().window(winHandle)` method to switch to the desired window handle. However, this method requires that the window handle be available before it can be used. If the window handle is not available yet, the method will throw a `NoSuchWindowException`. To avoid this, you can use a loop to check if the desired window handle is available before trying to switch to it. For example:\n```java\nwhile (true) {\n    String mainWindowsHandle = driver.getWindowHandle();\n    Set<String> handles = driver.getWindowHandles();\n    for (String winHandle : handles) {\n        if (winHandle.equals(windowTitle)) {\n            driver.switchTo().window(winHandle);\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n    if (winHandle == null) {\n        throw new NoSuchWindowException(\"Window with title '\" + windowTitle + \"' not found\");\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code will continue to loop until the desired window handle is found or a `NoSuchWindowException` is thrown. You can then use the `driver.getTitle()` method to retrieve the title of the current window and check if it matches the desired window title. If the window title does not match, you can continue to loop and try again."}
