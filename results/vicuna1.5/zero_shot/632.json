USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: different ways of sorting ArrayList of of HashMap<String, String>: :There are many question related to this which suggests to use Comparator to compare and sort data, and I am already trying it and struggling to make it work so please don't report it as duplicate.I have an arraylist of HashMap<String, String> ArrayList<HashMap<String, String>>and having data in this list in this form,title , link and number are keys.{ {title=\"\",link=\"\",number=}, {title=\"\",link=\"\",number=}, {title=\"\",link=\"\",number=} }Example,{ {title,link,number = 8}, {title,link,number = 1}, {title,link,number = 3} }should be changed to,{ {title,link,number = 1}, {title,link,number = 3}, {title,link,number = 8} }and I wanted to sort it based on the number, I have tried this,I create a new class (as suggested in many post to create new class to compare data) which implements Comparator.public class SortData implements Comparator<ArrayList<HashMap<String, String>>> the method which is automatically implemented is ,@Override    public int compare(ArrayList<HashMap<String, String>> lhs,            ArrayList<HashMap<String, String>> rhs) {        return 0;    }Now this method suggest to use two arraylist of Hashmap to compare, but since I have only one arraylist which needs to be sorted so what should i use for the second arraylist ?my Arraylist name is SecondArray, and I want to compare each value of it with the next value, @Override        public int compare(ArrayList<HashMap<String, String>> lhs,                ArrayList<HashMap<String, String>> rhs) {                lhs = SecondArray;                rhs = // How to compare to the next value of the same Array ?             return 0;        }How should I compare the same arraylist with the next value ?Update:each Array list element has three key/value pairs, one of them is a number , I want to sort the arraylist based on that number , which means, key/value pairs which has the lowest number should be first in the array list.\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.util.HashMap\n<<<code>>>: lhs.get(\"number\").toString().compareTo(rhs.get(\"number\").toString())\n<<<explanation>>>: You can use the get() method of HashMap to retrieve the value of the \"number\" key in both the lhs and rhs ArrayLists, and then compare the strings returned by the get() method using the compareTo() method. This will allow you to compare the numbers in the key/value pairs of the HashMap and sort the ArrayList accordingly."}
