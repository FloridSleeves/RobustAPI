What I am having trouble with is outputting the data into the output file. I cannot figure out how to print what prints on the console to the output file. Any help is greatly appreciated!public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {  // Declare variables    // Define your file names     final String INPUT_FILE  = (\"Input.txt\");    final String OUTPUT_FILE = (\"Output.txt\");  int numberOfNumbers = 0;   // Number of numbers in the input file  double sum = 0;            // The sum of the numbers  double average = 0;        // The average of the numbers read  double oneNumber;          // An individual number read from the file  double runningTotal = 0;   // the running total sum of the numbers  // Access the input/output files    File inputDataFile = new File(INPUT_FILE);    Scanner inputFile  = new Scanner(inputDataFile);    FileWriter outputDataFile = new FileWriter(OUTPUT_FILE);    PrintWriter outputFile = new PrintWriter(outputDataFile);    System.out.println(\"Reading  file \" + INPUT_FILE + \"\\r\\n\" +                       \"Creating file \" + OUTPUT_FILE);    // Read the input file and sum the numbers.     while (inputFile.hasNext()) {            numberOfNumbers++;            oneNumber = inputFile.nextDouble();            sum += oneNumber;                 // Calculate total sum             runningTotal += oneNumber;        // Calculate running total            average = sum / numberOfNumbers;  // Calculate the average        System.out.printf(\"%-10.2f\\t %.2f\\n\", oneNumber, runningTotal);            // 2. write the number and running total to the output file        }  // End while    // Add code here to:    // 1. write the number of numbers, the sum and the average  //    to the output file using DecimalFormat to format the sum and average    inputFile.close();  // close the input file    outputFile.close(); // close the output file    System.out.println(\"The sum of the \" + numberOfNumbers +                              \" numbers is \" + sum + \"\\n\" +                     \" and the average is \" + average);    System.exit(0);   } // End main} // End class\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.io.PrintWriter\n<<<code>>>: outputFile.write(String.format(\"%-10.2f\\t %.2f\\n\", oneNumber, runningTotal));\n<<<explanation>>>: This code uses the PrintWriter.write() method to write the formatted string to the output file. The String.format() method is used to format the string with the specified width and precision for the number and the tab character. The first argument is the number, and the second argument is the running total, both formatted with 2 decimal places and a width of 10 characters. The tab character (\\t) is used as a separator between the number and the running total."}
