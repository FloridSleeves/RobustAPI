{"api": "StringTokenizer.nextToken", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java: Handling browser's request in my ProxyServer: :I am writing ProxyServer, firstly I use ServerSocket to get Socket that is connected to me. Then I get InputStream from connected Socket and readed it. I have outputted the request of my browser to console:GET http://mail.ru/ HTTP/1.1Host: mail.ruProxy-Connection: keep-alive Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko)Chrome/31.0.1650.63 Safari/537.36Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate,sdchAccept-Language: ru-RU,ru;q=0.8,en-US;q=0.6,en;q=0.4Cookie: p=7nkAAOS6hAAA; mrcu=7D86524D326C5CB36F898F4A4CD9;_ga=GA1.2.1174941236.1388398432; c=PCwPUwAAAPKbAAAiAgAAcQAAz5QIAgAA;I must create new Socket to write this request to internet, but Socket needs port number and hostname(String) to connect. If we consider that port number is always 80 then from what part of this request I must get hostname? Is this GET http://mail.ru/ HTTP/1.1 or Host: mail.ru? Also, can I just send to internet only GET http://mail.ru/ HTTP/1.1 abandoning other parts?Last question is, should I have to rewrite this GET method itself?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(request);\nString host = st.nextToken();\nString url = st.nextToken();\nString method = st.nextToken();\nString headers = st.nextToken();\nString body = st.nextToken();\n<<<explanation>>>: To get the hostname from the request, you can use the StringTokenizer class to split the request into its individual parts. In this case, you can use the nextToken() method to retrieve the hostname. The hostname is the part of the request that comes before the question mark (?). If the request does not contain a hostname, the nextToken() method will return null.\n\nRegarding your question about sending the request to the internet, if you want to send the request to a specific host and port, you will need to create a new Socket and set the host and port as the remote endpoint. The hostname is the part of the request that comes before the question mark (?). If the request does not contain a hostname, the nextToken() method will return null.\n\nYou can send the request to the internet by creating a new Socket and setting the host and port as the remote endpoint. You can then write the request to the Socket using the write() method. However, you will need to make sure that the host and port you are sending the request to are correct and accessible.\n\nFinally, you do not need to rewrite the GET method itself, as it is a standard HTTP method and is already supported by most web servers."}
