{"api": "PrintWriter.write", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Split Flat File using Java: :I am fairly new to java and need some help.  I have flat file with 10 columns and a total of, lets say, 9750 rows.  All the rows are pipe delimited.  I need to split the file into 2000 rows each (5 files). How do I do this in Java?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"output/file1.txt\");\nfor (int i = 0; i < 9750; i += 2000) {\nwriter.write(data[i] + \"\\n\");\n}\nwriter.close();\n\n<<<explanation>>>: This code uses the PrintWriter.write() method to write the data from the flat file to a new file called \"output/file1.txt\". The data is read in chunks of 2000 rows and written to the new file using the \"\\n\" character as a delimiter. The PrintWriter.close() method is used to close the writer and ensure that any remaining data is written to the file."}
