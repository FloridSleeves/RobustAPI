USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Return the first or second element in a set: :Hopefully another simple question that shouldn't be difficult, but I'm new to Java and struggling. I have a set setElements in a class classA, which is a set of anther class' objects (classB), that will always only contain two elements. What I need to do is prepare a method that takes an argument, then checks if either element of setElements is equal to that argument. If one element is equal, the method returns the other element from the set.I'm just really struggling to get the functionality out and I'm fairly certain it's due to my mediocre Java skills :)This is the code I have now:Set<classB> setElements = new HashSet<classB>(); public classA(classB x, class B y) {        setElements.add(x);        setElements.add(y);\\\\method to return the other element if one element is equal to argumentpublic classB otherElement(classB argument){    for (classB x:setElements){        if (x==argument){            return \\\\other element in setElements} } }Please help!\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.util.Iterator.next()\n<<<code>>>: setElements.iterator().next()\n<<<explanation>>>: The method returns the first element of the set if called on an iterator. If there is no element in the set, it will throw a NoSuchElementException. In this case, we can use the iterator to check if there is an element in the set and return the other element if there is."}
