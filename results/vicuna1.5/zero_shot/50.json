I am trying to find the value how many times were the already installed packages executed (closed and open). I am aware i can do that for my application from sharepreferences but how to do for packages that are already there? I already have the list of the packages installed using PackageManager.Thanks in advance\nPlease using this api: ApplicationInfo.loadIcon.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: android.content.pm.ApplicationInfo\n<<<code>>>: appInfo.loadIcon()\n<<<explanation>>>: To get the icon of an installed application, you can use the loadIcon() method of the ApplicationInfo object. This method returns a Bitmap object that represents the icon of the application. However, this method only returns the icon of the application when it is in use, i.e., when the application is running or has been recently closed. It does not return the icon when the application is not in use, i.e., when it is closed or in the background. Therefore, you cannot use this method to determine the execution count of installed applications."}
