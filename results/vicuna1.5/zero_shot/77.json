{"api": "DataOutputStream.write", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Write and read multiple byte[] in file with Java: :I have to write byte arrays in a file. I can't do it in one time so I can't put my arrays in a container. Also the size of my arrays is variable.Secondly, the file is very huge, so I have to split it, in order to read it array by array.How can I do that ? I tried to write line by line my byte arrays  but I haven't been able. How can I put a separator between my arrays and after split it over this separator ?EDIT : I tried this :ByteArrayOutputStream bos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();ObjectOutput out = new ObjectOutputStream(bos);out.writeObject(byteArray);But, I execute this code several times, so the ObjectOutputStream adds each time a new header which corrupt the file.I also try : out.write(byteArray);but I couldn't separate my arrays. So I tried to append a '\\n', which didn't work. After I was looking for library like FileUtils in order to write byte[] line by line but I didn't find.\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.io.DataOutputStream\n<<<code>>>: DataOutputStream out = new DataOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(\"file.txt\"));\nfor (byte[] array : byteArrays) {\nout.write(array);\nout.write('\\n');\n}\nout.close();\n\nExplanation:\nTo write multiple byte[] arrays to a file, you can use the DataOutputStream.write method. This method writes the byte array to the file and also writes a newline character ('\\n') after each array to separate them. The FileOutputStream is used to write the data to the file. The for loop iterates through the list of byteArrays and writes each array to the DataOutputStream, followed by a newline character. Finally, the DataOutputStream and FileOutputStream are closed to ensure the file is properly closed."}
