USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to append to AES encrypted file: :I'm writing some kind of logger that produces encrypted log-file. Unfortunately, cryptography is not my strong side. Now I can write to file several messages and then close file. Then i can open it, append some messages, close again and after decryption I see padding bytes in the middle of file. Is there any way to work with encrypted file without having to decrypt it every time I want to append some messages?EDIT: little more details. Current implementation utlizes CipherOutputStream. As i understand there's no way to seek using it.Can i use 'NoPadding' option if i will control that output data size is divisible by block size?\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: RandomAccessFile.write\n<<<code>>>: f = new RandomAccessFile(\"encrypted_file.log\", \"rw\");\nf.setEncoding(\"UTF-8\");\nf.write(\"Appending message 1\\n\");\nf.write(\"Appending message 2\\n\");\nf.write(\"Appending message 3\\n\");\nf.close();\n\n<<<explanation>>>: Yes, you can use the 'NoPadding' option if you control that the output data size is divisible by the block size. However, in this case, you cannot seek using CipherOutputStream. Instead, you can use RandomAccessFile to write to the encrypted file. The code above opens the encrypted file in \"rw\" mode, writes three messages, and then closes the file.\n\nTo append to the encrypted file without decrypting it every time, you can open the file in \"r+\", \"rw+\", or \"rwd\" mode, depending on whether you want to read from and write to the file simultaneously. In this case, you can seek to the end of the file using the RandomAccessFile.seek() method and then write the new messages to the end of the file.\n\nKeep in mind that if you're using a block cipher like AES, the block size is typically 128 bits (16 bytes). If the output data size is not divisible by the block size, you'll need to pad the data with zeros to make it divisible by the block size. If you use the 'NoPadding' option, you'll need to ensure that the output data size is always divisible by the block size."}
