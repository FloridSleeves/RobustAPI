I believe it has something to do the the Context but I haven't got a clue how to implement it within my helper class.Any help would be greatly appreciated.\nPlease using this api: Activity.findViewById.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "The problem is that you are trying to call the `setupDatePicker()` method from the `onCreate()` method of the `MainActivity`, but you are not providing the `Context` object to the `AlarmHelper` class.\n\nTo fix this issue, you need to pass the `Context` object to the `AlarmHelper` class when you create an instance of it. You can do this by calling the `getApplicationContext()` method on the `MainActivity` and passing it to the `AlarmHelper` constructor.\n\nHere's the updated code:\n```java\nprotected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n    requestWindowFeature(Window.FEATURE_NO_TITLE);\n    getWindow().setFlags(WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_FULLSCREEN, WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_FULLSCREEN);\n    AlarmHelper helper = new AlarmHelper(getApplicationContext());\n    helper.setupDatePicker();\n    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n}\n```\nAnd in the `AlarmHelper` class, you need to add the `Context` parameter to the constructor and use it to get the `LayoutInflater` object to inflate the layout:\n```java\npublic AlarmHelper(Context context) {\n    this.context = context;\n}\n\npublic void setupDatePicker() {\n    long maxTime = 52560000;\n    final Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance();\n    DatePicker dp = (DatePicker) findViewById(R.id.datePicker);\n    dp.setMinDate(cal.getTimeInMillis() - 1000);\n    dp.setMaxDate(cal.getTimeInMillis() + maxTime);\n}\n```\nWith these changes, the `NullPointerException` should be resolved."}
