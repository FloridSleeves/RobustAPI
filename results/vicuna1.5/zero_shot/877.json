USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to know which data is from which table when you select data from multiple tables?: :I have a table of client contain the client id, name and last name, job ..etc...also I have 16 tables of the grants of client each table contain a different data(different grant) relate with the client by a foreign key of \"id\".......for example this is costumer table\"clients\":enter image description hereand this is an example for an grant of client called order:enter image description hereSo when I search for client, I search also for all the grants that he benefited them, and maybe a client can benefit from the same grant more than once........that's means we can find more than one row in the same table relate with the same client: As you see in the table Of order we have two row relate with the client who have id=2.: So I want to make one query to select all data from the first table and the second of the client \"Where id =2\"the problem is how I can get all the information relate with that client and to which row from which table ??\nPlease using this api: SQLiteDatabase.query.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: SQLiteDatabase.query\n<<<code>>>: SELECT * FROM clients WHERE id = 2\n<<<explanation>>>: This code will retrieve all the data from the \"clients\" table where the \"id\" column equals 2. It will return all the columns from the table for the client with id=2. Since the client can benefit from the same grant more than once, this query will return multiple rows, one for each grant that the client has benefited from."}
