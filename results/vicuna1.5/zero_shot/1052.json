The split() method of the String class takes a delimiter string as an argument and returns an array of strings. In this case, the delimiter string is \" |-\" which means that any occurrence of \" |-\" will be treated as a delimiter and the rest of the string will be returned as a separate element in the array. The StringTokenizer class provides a nextToken() method which returns the next token in the input string. In this case, we use the nextToken() method to remove the \"(\" and \")\" characters from the first element of the array."}
