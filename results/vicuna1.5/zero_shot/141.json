USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java Bulk WRITE: :I have to write a series of characters in the disk file and I want to use bulk writing to reduce disk I/O. Currently, I am using File Writer class. However, it is too slow. Can anybody help me how to perform bulk write in Java like maintaining a large buffer and periodically flush it.\nPlease using this api: FileChannel.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.nio.channels.FileChannel.write\n<<<code>>>:\n```java\nimport java.io.File;\nimport java.io.FileOutputStream;\nimport java.nio.channels.FileChannel;\n\npublic class BulkWriteExample {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\n        File file = new File(\"path/to/your/file.txt\");\n        FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(file);\n        FileChannel in = fos.getChannel();\n        FileChannel out = fos.getChannel();\n\n        // Create a large buffer to hold the characters you want to write\n        char[] buffer = new char[1024];\n\n        // Loop through the characters in the buffer and write them to the file\n        int bytesWritten = 0;\n        while (bytesWritten < buffer.length) {\n            int count = buffer.length - bytesWritten;\n            out.write(in, buffer, bytesWritten, count);\n            bytesWritten += count;\n        }\n\n        // Flush the buffer to ensure all characters are written to the file\n        out.force(true);\n\n        // Close the file and file output stream\n        fos.close();\n        out.close();\n    }\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>:\n\nThis code uses the `java.nio.channels.FileChannel.write` method to perform bulk writing to a file. It creates a large buffer to hold the characters you want to write and then loops through the buffer, writing the characters to the file in chunks using the `FileChannel.write` method. The `force(true)` method is called to flush the buffer and ensure that all characters are written to the file. Finally, the file output stream is closed to release any resources."}
