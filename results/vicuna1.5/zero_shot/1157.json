The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: String.split() not behaving in android: :I have a code in Java that is meant to get the server info from a Minecraft server. This returns data split by \u00a7. In eclipse, when run as an application, the code works fine. The issue is when I bring it to Android. I have done some research on this but haven't been able to find a working solution. (Have tried Pattern.quote(\"\u00a7\")) Here is an example of what I'm running:String input = \"Look like this\u00a70\u00a725\";String[] data = input.split(\"\u00a7\");The expected data would be a 3-long String[] with the values \"Look like this\", \"0\", and \"25\". This is what happens in eclipse. In android, I get a 1-long String[] with the value \"Look like this\u00a70\u00a725\". Does anyone know if this is an issue with android or am I doing something wrong?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String input = \"Look like this\u00a70\u00a725\";String[] data = input.split(\"\u00a7\");String output = new String();while(data[0] != null){output += data[0];data = data[1];}output += data[0];data = null;\n<<<explanation>>>: The issue with the given code is that it is not properly handling the \u00a7 character. Instead of splitting the string by \u00a7, it is splitting it by the ASCII value of \u00a7, which is 8204. To fix this, we need to use the StringTokenizer.nextToken method to split the string by \u00a7. This method will properly handle the \u00a7 character and return the desired output. The code above uses a while loop to iterate through the string and add each section to the output string. The last section is added to the output string after all other sections have been added."}
