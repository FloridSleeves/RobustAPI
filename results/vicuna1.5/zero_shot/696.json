I created a HelloWorld servlet (given below) to experiment with this problem. In the below example, you'll see that I am running 'doIt()' function in a new Thread (FutureTask). But it returns NULL but when I call 'doIt()' method directly, BeanManager is not NULL./** * Servlet implementation class HelloWorld */@WebServlet(\"/HelloWorld\")public class HelloWorld extends HttpServlet {    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;    private static Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(HelloWorld.class            .getName());    /**     * @see HttpServlet#doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)     */    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {        PrintWriter writer = response.getWriter();        writer.println(\"<html>\");        writer.println(\"<head><title>Hello World Servlet</title></head>\");        writer.println(\"<body>\");        writer.println(\"<h1>Context injection into Thread Experiment</h1>\");        try {            // 1. This is NOT working            new Thread(testTask).start();            testTask.get(5000, TimeUnit.SECONDS);            // 2. This is working                //doIt();        } catch (Exception e) {            e.printStackTrace();        }        writer.println(\"<body>\");        writer.println(\"</html>\");        writer.close();             }    Runnable runnable = new Runnable() {        @Override        public void run() {            try {                doIt();            } catch (Exception e) {                e.printStackTrace();            }        }    };    FutureTask<Object> testTask = new FutureTask<Object>(runnable, null);    protected void doIt() throws Exception {        if(getBeanManager() == null) {             throw new Exception( \"BEAN MANAGER IS NULL\");         }    }    public static BeanManager getBeanManager() {        try {            InitialContext initialContext = new InitialContext();            return (BeanManager) initialContext.lookup(\"java:comp/BeanManager\");        } catch (NamingException e) {            logger.info(\"Couldn't get BeanManager through JNDI\");            return null;        }    }}I searched online but could not find a good reference than saying it is possible. It would be great, if anybody can help me or provide me with some good pointers to inject/pass context into the new thread.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "The given API is `PrintWriter.write()`.\n\nThe code provided is a Java servlet implementation class `HelloWorld` that extends `HttpServlet`. The `doGet` method is overridden to handle HTTP GET requests. In this method, a new thread is created using the `Thread` class and the `testTask` object is created using the `FutureTask` class. The `doIt` method is called in the new thread using the `run` method of the `Runnable` object. The `getBeanManager` method is called to get the `BeanManager` object, which is used to inject the context.\n\nExplanation:\nThe code is trying to inject the context (bean manager) into a new thread created in the servlet using the `FutureTask` class. The `doIt` method is called in the new thread to demonstrate the issue. The `getBeanManager` method is called to get the bean manager object, which is used to inject the context. However, the code is returning `NULL` for the bean manager object, indicating that the context is not being injected into the new thread."}
