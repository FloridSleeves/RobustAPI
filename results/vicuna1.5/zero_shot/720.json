I am posting here for help as I have limited time available to fix this in my project. Help would be appreciated.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: String xmlString = \"<some tag>\" +\n                            \"<some_nested_tag attr=\\\"Hello\\\"> Text </some_nested_tag>\" +\n                            \"Hello world Hello Programming</some tag>\";\n                            \nString newXmlString = xmlString.replaceAll(\"Hello(?!\\\\w+\\\\b)\", \"HI\");\n\nPrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"output.xml\");\nwriter.write(newXmlString);\nwriter.close();\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The above code uses the `replaceAll()` method of the String class to replace all occurrences of \"Hello\" that are not followed by a word and a space with \"HI\". The `(?!\\\\w+\\\\b)` is a positive lookahead assertion that ensures that the \"Hello\" is not followed by a word and a space. The `PrintWriter.write()` method is used to write the modified XML string to a file named \"output.xml\"."}
