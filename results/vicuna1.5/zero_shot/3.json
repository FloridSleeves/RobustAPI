USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Change TextView value from Non-Activity class: :I'm trying to setText a new value to my TextView from a non activity class by inflating the layout where the textview is, but I'm still unsuccessful though I'm able to getText the current value of the TV. Here's the code:LayoutInflater mInflater = (LayoutInflater) mContext.getSystemService(mContext.LAYOUT_INFLATER_SERVICE);View view = mInflater.inflate(R.layout.target_details, null);TextView val = (TextView) view.findViewById(R.id.val);Not sure if I'm doing it properly.UPDATE:I used Kay's answer with added code below. It's now working.((Activity)mContext).runOnUiThread(new Runnable(){        @Override        public void run(){            //settext here        }    });\nPlease using this api: Activity.findViewById.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: android.app.Activity.findViewById\n<<<code>>>: ((Activity) mContext).findViewById(R.id.val)\n<<<explanation>>>: This code uses the Activity class to find the TextView with the id \"val\" in the layout and inflates it in the non-activity class. The runOnUiThread method is then called to execute the code on the UI thread, allowing you to set the text of the TextView."}
