USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Iterator retrieve first value and place it back on the same iterator: :I have the following scenario: I have an existing iterator Iterator<String> it and I iterate over its head (say first k elements, which are flagged elements, i.e. they start with '*' ). The only way to know that the flagged elements are over, is by noticing that the (k+1)th element is not flagged. The problem is that if I do that, the iterator it will not provide me the first value anymore on the next call to next().I want to pass this iterator to a method as it's only argument and I would like to avoid changing its signarture and it implementation. I know I could do this:    public void methodAcceptingIterator(Iterator<String> it) //current signature   //change it to   public void methodAcceptingIterator(String firstElement, Iterator<String> it)But this looks like a workarround/hack decreasing the elegance and generality of the code, so I don't want to this. Any ideas how I could solve this problem ?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next()\n<<<code>>>: it.next()\n<<<explanation>>>: You can use the Iterator.next() method to retrieve the first value from the iterator and place it back on the same iterator. This way, you can avoid changing the signature of the method that accepts the iterator as an argument. The code would look like this:\n```scss\npublic void methodAcceptingIterator(Iterator<String> it) {\n    String firstElement = it.next();\n    // continue with the iteration using the firstElement\n}\n```"}
