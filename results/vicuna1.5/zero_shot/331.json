(37 answers)                            Closed 4 years ago.I am looking for a method to combine an array of strings into a delimitedString. An opposite to split().Wanted to ask the forum before I try writing my own (since the JDK has everything)\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.util.Iterator\n<<<code>>>: Iterator.next()\n<<<explanation>>>: The `Iterator.next()` method returns the next element in the iteration order of the iterator. In the context of combining an array of strings into a delimited string, you can use this method to retrieve the next element in the array and concatenate it with a delimiter to create the delimited string. For example:\n```java\nString[] strings = {\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"};\nString delimiter = \" \";\nStringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\nIterator<String> iterator = strings.iterator();\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\n    sb.append(iterator.next()).append(delimiter);\n}\nString delimitedString = sb.toString();\n```\nThis code creates an array of strings, a delimiter string, and a `StringBuilder` to hold the delimited string. It then uses an iterator to iterate over the array and append each string to the `StringBuilder` with the delimiter in between. Finally, it returns the completed delimited string."}
