USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Console output into text file: :code to convert HTML file to .txt file. code for reference..public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"D:/ticket.htm\"));    String line;    while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {        sb.append(line).append(System.getProperty(\"line.separator\"));    }    String nohtml = sb.toString().replaceAll(\"\\\\<.*?>\", \"\");    String nospace = nohtml.replaceAll(            \"^\\\\s+|\\\\s+$|\\\\s*(\\n)\\\\s*|(\\\\s)\\\\s*\", \"$1$2\");    String new1 = nospace.replace(\"\\t\", \" \");    System.out.println(new1);    PrintWriter outs = new PrintWriter(\"D:/text123.txt\");    outs.write(new1);    outs.println(new1);    outs.close();}new1 contains text(HTML output) which I am able to print line by line in the eclipse console,but when am trying to copy that text into text file (text123.txt), the text is copied in the same line. I need to same console output to be copied in the text file i.e line by line.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.io.PrintWriter\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter outs = new PrintWriter(\"D:/text123.txt\"); outs.write(new1); outs.println(new1); outs.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The given code uses the PrintWriter API to write the content of the String variable \"new1\" to a text file \"D:/text123.txt\" line by line. The write() method is used to write the content to the file, and the println() method is used to add a newline character at the end of each line. The close() method is used to close the PrintWriter object and ensure that any pending output is written to the file."}
