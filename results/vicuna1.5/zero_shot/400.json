USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to determine if collection containing more than one max result?: :List<Integer> list;java.util.Collections.max(list)How can I determine if the list contains more than one max result? So to say: if I found the maximum, how can I ensure that this is the only entry in a collection?Thanks\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "The `Iterator.next()` method returns the next element in the iterator without removing it from the collection. To determine if a collection containing more than one maximum result, you can use a loop to iterate through the collection and check if the maximum value is the same as the next maximum value.\n\nHere's an example code snippet in Java:\n```java\nList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();\n// add some elements to the list\n\nIterator<Integer> iterator = list.iterator();\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\n    int max = iterator.next();\n    if (max == Collections.max(list)) {\n        // maximum is the same as the next maximum value\n        // so there are more than one maximum result\n        break;\n    }\n}\n\nif (iterator.hasNext()) {\n    // maximum is not the same as the next maximum value\n    // so there is only one maximum result\n    iterator.remove();\n}\n```\nIn this code, we first create a `List<Integer>` and add some elements to it. Then we create an iterator for the list using `iterator()` method. We then use a `while` loop to iterate through the list and check if the current maximum value is the same as the next maximum value. If they are the same, it means there are more than one maximum result, so we break out of the loop. If they are not the same, it means there is only one maximum result, so we remove the current maximum value using the `remove()` method of the iterator."}
