I want to read it from file (first string - first line in file etc.), do something with it and then write to another text file.How to do it?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"output.txt\");\nString inputString = \"Hello, world!\";\nwriter.write(inputString);\nwriter.close();\n\n<<<explanation>>>: To read and write strings from/to a text file using the PrintWriter.write API, you can create a PrintWriter object and use its write method to write the string to the file. In this example, the string \"Hello, world!\" is written to a file named \"output.txt\". You can also use the same PrintWriter object to write multiple strings to the file by calling the write method multiple times. Finally, you should close the PrintWriter object to ensure that any pending output is written to the file."}
