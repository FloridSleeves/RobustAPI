USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Is there any way to make a JSP print carriage returns (CR)?: :I'm currently generating some vCards using JSP. I found out some platforms don't recognize these generated vCards unless their lines are separated by Carriage Returns (CR), and JSP seems to use just Line Feed (LF) by default to separate lines.Do you guys know any way to tell the JSP to include a CR between each line?I hope someone has a clue, cause I haven't found much out there...Thanks in advance!\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter.write(\"\\r\\n\")\n<<<explanation>>>: You can use the PrintWriter.write() method to add a carriage return (CR) and line feed (LF) combination at the end of each line of text that you write to the output stream. By writing \"\\r\\n\" to the output stream, you will add a CR followed by an LF, which will create a line break with both CR and LF characters. This should ensure that the generated vCards are recognized by all platforms."}
