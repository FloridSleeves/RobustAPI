In this case, you want to retrieve the COLUMN\\_APP\\_ID field, so you can pass an array with just that column name. You can also pass a WHERE clause to filter the results, in this case, you want to filter by the id column, so you can pass the id + \"\" as a string. This will return a Cursor object that you can use to retrieve the data from the database. You can use a while loop to iterate through the cursor and retrieve the data for each row."}
