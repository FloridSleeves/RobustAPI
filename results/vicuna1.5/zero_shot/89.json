The DataOutputStream object is created by calling the createSocket() method of the WIFI Direct client object. Then, you can use the writeUTF() method of the DataOutputStream object to write the data to be sent as a string. Finally, you can use the flush() and close() methods of the DataOutputStream object to send the data."}
