USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Looking for an example for inserting content into the response using a servlet filter: :I've been searching the net and stackoverflow for an example of somebody inserting content into the response using a servlet filter, but can only find examples of people capturing/compressing the output and/or changing the headers. My goal is to append a chunk of HTML just before the closing </body> of all HTML responses.I'm working on a solution that extends the HttpServletResponseWrapper to use my own PrintWriter, then overriding the write methods thereon. Inside the write method I'm storing the last 7 characters to see if it's equal to the closing body tag, and then I write my HTML chunk plus the closing body tag, before continuing normal write operations for the rest of the document.I feel that somebody must have solved this problem already, and probably more elegantly than I will. I'd appreciate any examples of how to use a servlet filter to insert content into a response.UPDATEDResponding to a comment, I am also trying to implement the CharResponseWrapper from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/filters-137243.html. Here is my code:PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();CharResponseWrapper wrappedResponse = new CharResponseWrapper(        (HttpServletResponse)response);chain.doFilter(wrappedRequest, wrappedResponse);String s = wrappedResponse.toString();if (wrappedResponse.getContentType().equals(\"text/html\") &&        StringUtils.isNotBlank(s)) {    CharArrayWriter caw = new CharArrayWriter();    caw.write(s.substring(0, s.indexOf(\"</body>\") - 1));    caw.write(\"WTF</body></html>\");    response.setContentLength(caw.toString().length());    out.write(caw.toString());}else {    out.write(wrappedResponse.toString());}out.close();I am also wrapping the request, but that code works and shouldn't affect the response.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "The `PrintWriter.write` method is used to write characters to the output stream. It takes two arguments: a string of characters to be written and an integer representing the number of characters to be written.\n\nIn your code, you are using the `PrintWriter.write` method to write the content of the `CharArrayWriter` to the output stream. However, you are also setting the `Content-Length` header of the response to the length of the `CharArrayWriter`. This is not necessary, as the length of the response is already determined by the size of the `CharArrayWriter`.\n\nHere's an updated version of your code that only writes the content of the `CharArrayWriter` to the output stream:\n```scss\nCharArrayWriter caw = new CharArrayWriter();\ncaw.write(s.substring(0, s.indexOf(\"</body>\") - 1));\ncaw.write(\"WTF</body></html>\");\nresponse.setContentLength(caw.toString().length());\nout.write(caw.toString());\n```\nThis code should insert the HTML chunk \"WTF</body></html>\" just before the closing </body> of all HTML responses."}
