USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to create a Java Iterator for 2D array/list: :I was recently asked about the question that how to create a Java Iterator for 2D Array, specifically how to implement:public class PersonIterator implements Iterator<Person>{    private List<List<Person>> list;    public PersonIterator(List<List<Person>> list){        this.list = list;    }    @Override    public boolean hasNext() {    }    @Override    public Person next() {    }}1D array is pretty straightforward by using a index to track the position, any idea about how to do it for 2D lists.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next()\n<<<code>>>: private class PersonIterator implements Iterator<Person> {\nprivate List<List<Person>> list;\npublic PersonIterator(List<List<Person>> list) {\nthis.list = list;\n}\n@Override\npublic boolean hasNext() {\nreturn !list.isEmpty();\n}\n@Override\npublic Person next() {\nif (hasNext()) {\nreturn list.get(0).get(0);\n} else {\nthrow new NoSuchElementException();\n}\n}\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: To create a Java Iterator for a 2D array (in this case, a List of Lists of Person objects), you can use the Iterator.next() method to implement the next() method of the Iterator interface. The hasNext() method should return true as long as the list is not empty, and the next() method should return the first Person object in the first List in the list. If the list is empty, the next() method should throw a NoSuchElementException."}
