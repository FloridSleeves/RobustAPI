USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to return an iterator over even numbers, given an iterator over a list of integers?: :I was asked this question in a java interview. I am given an iterator for a list of integers. I need to write a function that returns takes this iterator as argument and returns the iterator for even numbers only. I was told, I cannot modify the original list of numbers. Hence, removing odd numbers from the list is not the solution. Please advise. Thanks.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: iterator.next()\n<<<explanation>>>: This code uses the Iterator.next() method to retrieve the next element in the iterator, which is an integer. The method returns the next element in the iteration without removing it from the original list. This allows you to iterate over the list and return an iterator for even numbers only without modifying the original list."}
