Improve this question                    I have a database with two tables , First one contains 2 columns: group_ID , group_name . And the second one : ID, Word, Definition , word_group_id . This is the prototype of the function which I am going to write WordContainer [] findWordsByGroupId(int id);and this is the WordContainer class:public class WordContainer {      String word;      String definition;      int id  = -1;public WordContainer (int id , String word ,String definition){    this.id = id;    this.word = word;    this.definition = definition;}public void setWord (String word){    this.word = word;}public void setDefinition (String definition){    this.definition = definition;}public String getWord (){    return this.word;}public String getDefinition (){    return this.definition;}}So the question is , How to write a SQLite query which will find all the rows (or ids of those rows)which have the given group_id ; \nPlease using this api: SQLiteDatabase.query.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: SQLiteDatabase.query\n<<<code>>>: SQLiteDatabase db = ...; String[] projection = {WordContainer._ID, WordContainer.WORD, WordContainer.DEFINITION}; String selection = WordContainer.GROUP_ID + \"=?\"; String[] selectionArgs = {id}; db.query(WordContainer.TABLE_NAME, projection, selection, selectionArgs, null, null, null);\n<<<explanation>>>: This code uses the SQLiteDatabase.query method to find all rows in the WordContainer table where the group\\_id matches the given id. The method takes in several parameters including the database, the table to query, a projection array specifying which columns to return, a selection string specifying the condition to filter by, and an array of selection arguments. The null parameters are for the order and limit of the query. The result of this query is a Cursor object containing the matching rows."}
