USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to execute \"an exe with return value\" in java?: :I created an executable using cpp which accepts two integer values and then returns the sum. I'm executing the EXE with Java using the following code:try {    pr = rt.exec(\"C:\\\\Users\\\\babesha.fm\\\\Desktop\\\\SUM.exe 10 5\");    int exitVal = pr.waitFor();    System.out.println(\"Exited with error code \" + exitVal);} catch (IOException e) {    // TODO Auto-generated catch block    e.printStackTrace();} catch (InterruptedException e) {    // TODO Auto-generated catch block    e.printStackTrace();}I used the return statement while creating the exe.But the problem is when I executed this exe by using the above java code. pr.waitFor(); statement returns the sum value instead of successful exicution.Did I done anything wrong .\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read()\n<<<code>>>: pr.getInputStream().read()\n<<<explanation>>>: The issue with the given code is that it is reading the entire output of the executable, including the return value, instead of just the sum value. To fix this, you can use the InputStream.read() method to read the output stream of the executable and get the sum value separately. The code should look like this:\n```java\ntry {\n    pr = rt.exec(\"C:\\\\Users\\\\babesha.fm\\\\Desktop\\\\SUM.exe 10 5\");\n    int exitVal = pr.waitFor();\n    InputStream in = pr.getInputStream();\n    byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\n    int bytesRead = 0;\n    while ((bytesRead = in.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n        System.out.print(new String(buffer, 0, bytesRead));\n    }\n    System.out.println(\"Exited with error code \" + exitVal);\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n} catch (InterruptedException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n```\nThis code reads the output stream of the executable one byte at a time and prints it to the console. The sum value can be extracted from the output by looking for the line that contains the sum value and printing it separately."}
