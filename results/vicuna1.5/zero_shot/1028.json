{"api": "StringTokenizer.nextToken", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Using the same indices between two arrays to get relevant information?: :I have a data reader that tokenizes input strings by given delimiters. The tokens go to an ArrayList, and the delimiters go to another. For example:this + is - an * inputThis sentence would be tokenized so that \"this\", \"is\", \"an\" and \"input\" would go to the token array while \"+\", \"-\" and \"*\" go to the delimiters array. Now, I need to store the original indices of these as well, so that the tokens would have indices 0, 2, 4 and 6 and the deliminators would have indices 1, 3 and 5. The normal solution would be to put them into the same array, but I need to keep them separated for performance reasons (e.g. to quickly check through the delimiters).How could this indexing be done so that when I have a token index 'i', I could easily get the deliminator from index 'i+1' without looping through all the delimiters?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(\"this + is - an * input\");\nint tokenIndex = 0;\nwhile (st.hasMoreTokens()) {\nString token = st.nextToken();\nint delimiterIndex = tokenIndex + 1;\nString delimiter = st.nextToken();\n```css\n    tokenIndex++;\n    System.out.println(\"Token: \" + token + \", Delimiter: \" + delimiter + \", Index: \" + delimiterIndex);\n```\n}\n\nExplanation:\nWe can use the `StringTokenizer` class to tokenize the input string. We create a new `StringTokenizer` object with the input string. Then, we loop through the tokens using a `while` loop and get the next token using the `nextToken()` method. We also get the next delimiter using the `nextToken()` method and store it in a variable called `delimiter`. We then increment the `tokenIndex` variable by 1 to keep track of the next token index. Finally, we print out the token, delimiter, and index using the `println()` method."}
