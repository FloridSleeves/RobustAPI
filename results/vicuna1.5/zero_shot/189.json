USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java program to count lines, words, and chars from a text given file: :I am practicing to write a program that gets a text file from user and provides data such as characters, words, and lines in the text.I have searched and looked over the same topic but cannot find a way to make my code run.public class Document{private Scanner sc;// Sets users input to a file namepublic Document(String documentName) throws FileNotFoundException {    File inputFile = new File(documentName);    try {        sc = new Scanner(inputFile);    } catch (IOException exception) {        System.out.println(\"File does not exists\");    }}public int getChar() {    int Char= 0;    while (sc.hasNextLine()) {        String line = sc.nextLine();        Char += line.length() + 1;    }    return Char;}// Gets the number of words in a textpublic int getWords() {    int Words = 0;    while (sc.hasNext()) {        String line = sc.next();        Words += new StringTokenizer(line, \" ,\").countTokens();    }    return Words;}public int getLines() {    int Lines= 0;    while (sc.hasNextLine()) {        Lines++;    }    return Lines;}  }Main method: public class Main {    public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException {        DocStats doc = new DocStats(\"someText.txt\");        // outputs 1451, should be 1450        System.out.println(\"Number of characters: \"            + doc.getChar());         // outputs 0, should be 257        System.out.println(\"Number of words: \" + doc.getWords());        // outputs 0, should be 49        System.out.println(\"Number of lines: \" + doc.getLines());     }}I know exactly why I get 1451 instead of 1451. The reason is because I do not have '\\n' at the end of the last sentence but my method adds  numChars += line.length() + 1;However, I cannot find a solution to why I get 0 for words and lines.*My texts includes elements as: ? , - 'After all, could anyone help me to make this work? **So far, I the problem that concerns me is how I can get a number of characters, if the last sentence does not have '\\n' element. Is there a chance I could fix that with an if statement? -Thank you!\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read()\n<<<code>>>: sc.useDelimiter(\"\\\\A\").next();\n<<<explanation>>>: This code uses the \"\\\\A\" delimiter to indicate the end of the input, and then calls the \"next\" method on the Scanner object to read the entire contents of the file into a string. The number of characters in the file can be obtained by counting the number of characters in this string."}
