{"api": "String.getBytes", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Socket Connection from live Flash to local java: :I'm trying to get a live flash that lives on a webserver to talk to a local java server, that will live on the clients PC. I'm trying to achieve this with a socket connection. (port 6000)Now, at first flash was able to connect, but it just sends <policy-file-request/>. After this nothing happens.Now, some people at Kirupa suggested to send an cross-domain-policy xml as soon as any connection is established from the java side. http://www.kirupa.com/forum/showthread.php?t=301625However, my java server just throws the following:End Exception: java.net.SocketException: Software caused connection abort: recv failedI've already spend a great amount of time on this subject, and was wondering if anyone here knows what to do?\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: String.getBytes()\n<<<code>>>: flash.connect(\"localhost\", 6000);\nflash.send(\"<?xml version=\\\"1.0\\\" encoding=\\\"utf-8\\\"?>\\n<cross-domain-policy>\\n<allow-access-from domain=\\\"*\\\" to domain=\\\"*\\\" />\\n</cross-domain-policy>\\n\");\n<<<explanation>>>: It seems that the issue is with the cross-domain policy XML being sent from the Java server. The XML needs to be sent as a string first, and then converted to bytes using the getBytes() method before sending it over the socket connection. Additionally, the domain names in the XML need to be replaced with the actual domain names of the server and client."}
