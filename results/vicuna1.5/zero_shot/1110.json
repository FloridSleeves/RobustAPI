USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to group hour with corresponding minutes in android?: :I am doing some train application. In the application I am maintaining train time. From my database I can able to fetch times as String array list like this    train_schedule_time------>[8.2, 13.55, 0.45]Now I want to segregate my array by hour with corresponding minutes like this ...I am using StringTokenizer and split into hour array and minute array. But i can't able to group my hour with multiple minutes and I have to show in list view. How can i do this? Can anybody help me? Thank in advance\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String scheduleTime = \"8.2, 13.55, 0.45\";\nString hour[] = new String[3];\nString minute[] = new String[3];\nStringTokenizer tokenizer = new StringTokenizer(scheduleTime, \",\");\nfor (int i = 0; i < tokenizer.countTokens(); i++) {\nString token = tokenizer.nextToken();\nif (i == 0) {\nhour[0] = token;\n} else if (i == 1) {\nminute[1] = token;\n} else {\nminute[0] = token;\n}\n}\nfor (int i = 0; i < hour.length; i++) {\nLog.d(\"Hour\", hour[i]);\nfor (int j = 0; j < minute.length; j++) {\nLog.d(\"Minute\", minute[j]);\n}\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: This code uses the StringTokenizer class to split the given train schedule time string into an array of hours and an array of minutes. The first time in the string is stored in the first element of the hour array, the second time is stored in the second element of the minute array, and so on. The code then logs the hour and minute arrays to the console, which can be used to display the data in a list view."}
