Closed 10 years ago.I want to write byte array to a file as bytes. e.g. byt[] =\"hello\".getBytes();I want to write the byt to a file , such that I see the contents as bytes, not as \"hello\".How can I do that?\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: String.getBytes()\n<<<code>>>: byt = \"hello\".getBytes()\n<<<explanation>>>: The code above reads the string \"hello\" and converts it into a byte array using the getBytes() method of the String class. The resulting byte array is stored in the variable \"byt\". To write this byte array to a file, you can use the FileWriter class and the write() method. Here's an example:\n\n<<<code>>>: FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(\"file.txt\")\n<<<code>>>: writer.write(new String(byt))\n<<<explanation>>>: The above code creates a FileWriter object named \"writer\" and uses it to write the contents of the byte array \"byt\" to a file named \"file.txt\". The write() method of the FileWriter class takes a string argument, which is converted into bytes using the String class's getBytes() method, and then written to the file. This will write the byte array \"byt\" to the file as bytes, not as the string \"hello\"."}
