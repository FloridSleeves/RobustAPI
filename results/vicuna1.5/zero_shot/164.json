USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Child Process will neither complete nor abort in Windows?: :How to make my java parent process wait till child process gets completed. I have tried with runtime.exec and with processBuilder.pb: String cmd = \"ffmpeg -i input.vob output.mp4\" Runtime rt = Runtime.getRuntime();Process proc = rt.exec(cmd); proc.waitFor();This works fine with small input file (say less than 10 Mb). If I give larger input file then program will be hanged. Output file will be partially created and file creation will be hanged and control will not return. Even proc.join(10000); did not give any useful result. Here parent process is terminating before child process (ffmpeg) gets completed.How to overcome this problem?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "The issue you are facing is because the `Runtime.exec()` method does not wait for the child process to complete. To make the parent process wait for the child process to complete, you can use the `ProcessBuilder` API and the `waitFor()` method.\n\nHere's the updated code:\n```java\n<<<api>>>: java.lang.ProcessBuilder\n<<<code>>>: ProcessBuilder.create().directory(new File(System.getProperty(\"user.dir\"))).command(\"ffmpeg\", \"-i\", \"input.vob\", \"output.mp4\").directory(new File(System.getProperty(\"user.dir\"))).start();\nProcess proc = ProcessBuilder.create().directory(new File(System.getProperty(\"user.dir\"))).command(\"ffmpeg\", \"-i\", \"input.vob\", \"output.mp4\").directory(new File(System.getProperty(\"user.dir\"))).start();\nInputStream in = proc.getInputStream();\nInputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(in);\nBufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);\nString line;\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\nproc.waitFor();\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* We create a `ProcessBuilder` object and set the command to be executed as \"ffmpeg -i input.vob output.mp4\".\n* We start the process using the `start()` method of the `ProcessBuilder` object.\n* We get the input stream of the process using the `getInputStream()` method of the `Process` object.\n* We create an `InputStreamReader` object and a `BufferedReader` object to read the input stream.\n* We read the input stream line by line using the `readLine()` method of the `BufferedReader` object.\n* Finally, we call the `waitFor()` method of the `Process` object to wait for the child process to complete."}
