USER: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can a HashMap consist only of one entry/object?: :I would like to have a HashMap with only one key-value object.I have created the following HashMap:    HashMap <Integer,String>DocsCollection = new HashMap <Integer,String>();In the HashMap I would like to have only one entry/object.The key type is an Integer.The value type is a String.e.g.  = <1,\"foo.txt\"> Every time I find a specific word in a file I would like toIncrement the counter in keyAdd the new file in the valuee.g. Let's say that I'm searching for the word \"Hello\" in a DocsCollection,I have to store for every appearance of the word \"Hello\" the term frequency and concatenate the new file to the previous value.<3,\"foo.txt,hello.txt,test.txt\"> 3 means that I've found the word \"Hello\" in three files.and the Value consists of the files where the word was foundIf I use the method put, a new entry is created in the HashMap cause the key changes.It's not stable. It begins with \"1\" but when I find the word second time , the key increments and then the put method inserts a new entry with a new keyBut i would like to have only one entry and modify the key.Can this be done?How can i have only one object in a HashMap and modify the key every time?   DocsCollection.put(2,\"foo.txt,hello.txt\"); Thanks, in advance\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer: ASSISTANT:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.util.Map.get()\n<<<code>>>: DocsCollection.get(1)\n<<<explanation>>>: To have only one entry in a HashMap with a specific key, you can use the `get()` method of the `Map` interface. The `get()` method returns the value associated with the specified key, or null if the key is not found. In this case, you can use the `get()` method to retrieve the value associated with the key of 1, and then modify the value as needed. For example, you can use the `put()` method to add a new key-value pair to the HashMap, or you can use the `remove()` method to remove an existing key-value pair."}
