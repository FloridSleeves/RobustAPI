I am able to find the minimum item, but I am having trouble removing it.  My code is below.  public Comparable removeMin() {    Iterator<T> it = iterator();    T min = it.next();    while (it.hasNext()) {        T next = it.next();        if (min.compareTo(next) > 0)            min = next;        it.remove();    }    System.out.println(min);    return min;}I have the print statement there just to verify that it is in fact getting the minimum item.  The code in main looks like this.public static void main(String[] args) {  Bag<String> sbag = new Bag<String>();    sbag.add(\"Noriko\");    sbag.add(\"Peter\");     sbag.add(\"Buddy\");    sbag.add(\"Mary\");    sbag.removeMin();  }When I run the sbag.removeMin(); command, the console prints \"Buddy\" which tells me that it is choosing \"Buddy\" as the min item.  However, if I instead populate sbag with integers, it always prints the smallest integer, which indicates to me I have my code correct in that regard.I have two questions.1). When passing a list of strings such as above, how does Java determine which is smallest?2). How can I fix my code so that it not only finds the minimum item, but also removes it?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: \nTo fix your code and remove the minimum item from the data array, you can modify your removeMin() method as follows:\n\npublic Comparable removeMin() {\n    Iterator<T> it = iterator();\n    T min = it.next();\n    while (it.hasNext()) {\n        T next = it.next();\n        if (min.compareTo(next) > 0)\n            min = next;\n    }\n    it.remove(); // Remove the minimum item\n    System.out.println(min);\n    return min;\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \n1) When passing a list of strings, Java determines the smallest string based on lexicographical order. It compares the strings character by character, starting from the first character, and determines the order based on the Unicode values of the characters.\n\n2) To remove the minimum item, you need to call the remove() method on the Iterator after finding the minimum item. In your code, you were calling it.remove() inside the while loop, which would remove every element except the last one.
