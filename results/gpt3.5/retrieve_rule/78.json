It wait for EOF but I can't send it because if I use out.close();orskt.shutdownOutput();I close the Socket and I must keep this connection alive.I can't send '\\0' becouse I get Parse Error in the server.How can I do it? Can I \"close\" the output stream without closing the socket?RESOLVEDI've created new class XMLStreamOutput and XMLStreamInput with advanced Stream gesture.\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: DataOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>: \nDataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(out);\ndos.write(xmlData.getBytes());\ndos.flush();\ndos.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: To send XML data through a socket InputStream, you can use the DataOutputStream.write method. First, create a DataOutputStream object with the OutputStream obtained from the socket. Then, use the write method to write the XML data as bytes to the output stream.
