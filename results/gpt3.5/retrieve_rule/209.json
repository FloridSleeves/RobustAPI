However, it seems I cannot find a way to do it.. I tried with JMF, but I get java.io.IOException: Invalid Http response everytime I run the code.Here is what I tried:Player player = Manager.createPlayer(new URL(\"http://50.7.98.106:8398\"));player.start();The .pls file:[playlist]NumberOfEntries=1File1=http://50.7.98.106:8398/In the piece of code above I'm setting the URL by hand, just for testing, but I've sucessfuly done the .pls downloading code and it's working, and from this I make another question, is it a better approach to just simply play the .pls file locally? Can it be done?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: \n```\nURL url = new URL(\"http://example.com/playlist.pls\");\nInputStream inputStream = url.openStream();\nBufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(inputStream));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {\n    if (line.startsWith(\"File\")) {\n        String urlStr = line.substring(line.indexOf(\"=\") + 1);\n        URL streamUrl = new URL(urlStr);\n        InputStream stream = streamUrl.openStream();\n        // Use the stream to play the radio\n        break;\n    }\n}\nreader.close();\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: \nTo stream a URL from a .pls file in Java, you can use the InputStream.read API.
