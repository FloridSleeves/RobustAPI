I was able to do the random number using the math.rand() but I am trying to make sure that the three numbers do not match. I did a work around using while and if statements, but I was looking to see if there is a one line of command to do this, so that I can put it right under th activity class so that it's public var. and in that area (activity) I can't use while and if statements, I only can in onCreate due to the void or something. Thank you in advance for your help, and will vote for any help or idea that will lead to finding any info about this. \nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Activity.setContentView\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nimport java.util.Random;\n\npublic class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {\n    private int num1, num2, num3;\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n\n        Random random = new Random();\n        num1 = random.nextInt(100) + 1;\n        num2 = random.nextInt(100) + 1;\n        num3 = random.nextInt(100) + 1;\n\n        while (num1 == num2 || num1 == num3 || num2 == num3) {\n            num1 = random.nextInt(100) + 1;\n            num2 = random.nextInt(100) + 1;\n            num3 = random.nextInt(100) + 1;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: \nTo generate three random numbers between 1 and 100, excluding any numbers that are the same, you can use the `Random` class in Java.
