There is a server which has been written in python like this which I shouldn't not change.s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)s.connect((TCP_IP, TCP_PORT))s.send('from server\\nnewline\\0')data = s.recv(BUFFER_SIZE)s.close()Now I want to write a code in Java which read the string from a server. Something like this:public static String readStr(Socket client) throws IOException {        InputStreamReader inStream = new InputStreamReader(                client.getInputStream());        BufferedReader inBuff = new BufferedReader(inStream);        String answer = new String();        String str = inBuff.readLine();        while (str!=null) {            answer = answer.concat(str + \"\\n\");            str = inBuff.readLine();        }        answer = answer.substring(0, answer.length() - 1);        System.out.println(\"answer:\\n \"+answer);        return answer;    }But it seems that it blocks at line str = inBuff.readLine(); at the last line of the message. I tried the read() method but it was blocked too.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: \npublic static String readStr(Socket client) throws IOException {\n    InputStream inStream = client.getInputStream();\n    StringBuilder answer = new StringBuilder();\n    int data;\n    while ((data = inStream.read()) != -1) {\n        answer.append((char) data);\n    }\n    System.out.println(\"answer:\\n\" + answer.toString());\n    return answer.toString();\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nIn this code, we use the InputStream.read() method to read data from the server socket.
