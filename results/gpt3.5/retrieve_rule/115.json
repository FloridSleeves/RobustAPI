I just can't get it to work. PS: the java client works using ObjectInputStream----EDIT----Thanks all for advices, I've replaced the byte stream with predefined bytes and discovered that Java was sending some headers when sending bytes because it was using ObjectOutputStream.Now the java code for writing to socket is:    DataOutputStream oos = null;    try {        oos = new DataOutputStream(os);        oos.write(byteImage);    } catch (Exception e) {        Log.e(TAG, \"Error while writing to OutputStream\", e);        cancel();        setState(STATE_NONE, this.type);    }\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: DataOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>: oos.write(byteImage);\n<<<explanation>>>: The code is using the DataOutputStream.write method to write the byte array \"byteImage\" to the output stream \"oos\".
