{"api": "Iterator.next", "prompt": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nFor API Iterator.next, the API usage rule is: Get the next element from an Iterator if it has more elements.\n\nQuestion: Why polymorphism does not work as I'd expect in my code?: :I'm quite new to Java and have come accross to a strange behaviour that I can not explain why this happens or where is the mistake in my code.Here's the code:import java.util.ArrayList;import java.util.Arrays;import java.util.Iterator;abstract class Shape {    public abstract void printMe(String no);}final class Circle extends Shape {    @Override    public void printMe(String no){        System.out.println(\"This is Circle no: \" + no);    }}final class Square extends Shape {    @Override    public void printMe(String no) {        System.out.println(\"This is Square no: \" + no);    }}final class Triangle extends Shape {    @Override    public void printMe(String no) {        System.out.println(\"This is Triangle no: \" + no);    }}public class Foo {    private ArrayList<Shape> shapes;    public Foo(){        this.shapes   = new ArrayList<Shape>();        this.shapes.add(new Circle());        this.shapes.add(new Square());        this.shapes.add(new Triangle());    }    public void printShapes(ArrayList<String> numbers){        for(String s:numbers){            Iterator<Shape> iter = this.shapes.iterator();            Shape shape = iter.next();            shape.printMe(s);        }    }    public static void main(String[] args) {        ArrayList<String> numbers = new ArrayList<String>(Arrays.asList(\"1\", \"2\", \"3\"));        Foo foo = new Foo();        foo.printShapes(numbers);    }}The output I'd expect would be:This is Circle no: 1This is Square no: 2This is Triangle no: 3However, the output I get is:This is Circle no: 1This is Circle no: 2This is Circle no: 3What am I doing wrong?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: The mistake in your code is that you are calling `iter.next()` inside the for loop without checking if the iterator has more elements. This causes the iterator to always return the first element in the list, which is a Circle. To fix this, you need to move the `iter.next()` call outside the for loop and store the result in a variable. Then, inside the for loop, you can use that variable to call the `printMe()` method.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\n```java\npublic void printShapes(ArrayList<String> numbers){\n    Iterator<Shape> iter = this.shapes.iterator();\n    for(String s:numbers){\n        if(iter.hasNext()){\n            Shape shape = iter.next();\n            shape.printMe(s);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The `Iterator.next()` method returns the next element in the iteration if there is one.
