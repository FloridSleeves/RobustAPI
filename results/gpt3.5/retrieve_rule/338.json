For example, a set of football players and we partition them depending on the team they belong to. I want in the end a list of representatives, i.e. one player from each team.All football players know all other player on their team -- this is very relevant for the complexity. So, my current idea on how to do this is as follows (where set is currently a LinkedHashSet<T>): while (!set.isEmpty()) {    E e = set.iterator().next();    makeRepresentative(e);    set.remove(AllPlayersOnSameTeamAs(e));}However, it feels weird to build a new iterator in every step of the while-loop. A LinkedHashSet is supposed to have some kind of firstElement() function internally (for its LinkedList behaviour), but for some reason I can't find how to do this. I also tried a foreach loop instead, but that resulted in a java.util.ConcurrentModificationException. How am I supposed to do this correctly?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next()\n<<<code>>>: To get one element from a LinkedHashSet in Java, you can use the Iterator.next() method.\nHere is an example code snippet:\n\nLinkedHashSet<T> set = new LinkedHashSet<>();\n// Add elements to the set\n\nIterator<T> iterator = set.iterator();\nif (iterator.hasNext()) {\n    T element = iterator.next();\n    // Process the element\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The code creates an iterator for the LinkedHashSet using the iterator() method.
