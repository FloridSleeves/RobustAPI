I am using a Socket to connect to a server, creating a http GET request, then am using a Buffered Reader to read in data. Here is what the code looks like compacted:    Socket conn = new Socket(server, 80);    //Request made here    BufferedReader inFromServer = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(conn.getInputStream()));    String response;    while((response = inFromServer.readLine()) != null){        System.out.println(response);    }I would like to read in the data, instead of as a String, as a byte array, and write it to a file. How is this possible? Any help is greatly appreciated, thank you.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: \nSocket conn = new Socket(server, 80);\n//Request made here\nInputStream inFromServer = conn.getInputStream();\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\nint bytesRead;\nFileOutputStream fileOutputStream = new FileOutputStream(\"output.txt\");\nwhile ((bytesRead = inFromServer.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n    fileOutputStream.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);\n}\nfileOutputStream.close();\n\n<<<explanation>>>: To read from an InputStream in Java and convert it to a byte array, you can use the InputStream.read method. In your case, you can obtain the InputStream from the Socket using conn.getInputStream(). Then, you can create a byte array buffer to store the read data. You can specify the size of the buffer according to your needs. In the example code, a buffer size of 1024 bytes is used. \n\nYou can then create a FileOutputStream to write the data to a file. In the while loop, you can use the read method to read data from the InputStream into the buffer. The read method returns the number of bytes read, or -1 if the end of the stream has been reached.
