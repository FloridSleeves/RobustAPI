Based on the TMX guide, in order to get the GID's I have to first base64 decode the string, then gunzip the resulting data if the compression attribute is set to \"gzip\" as in the above example. Finally, you can read 4 bytes at a time for each GID from the beginning of the data stream until the end.I think I've figured out the base64 decoding and 'gunzip' but the result from the code below is 27,0,0,0 repeating. I think the output is supposed to be (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) Thanks! public static void main( String[] args ) { String myString = \"H4sIAAAAAAAAAO3NoREAMAgEsLedAfafE4+s6l0jolNJiif18tt/Fj8AAMC9ARtYg28AEAAA\"; byte[] decode = Base64.decodeBase64(myString); ByteArrayInputStream byteArrayInputStream = new ByteArrayInputStream(decode);  GZIPInputStream gzipInputStream; int read; try {      gzipInputStream = new GZIPInputStream(byteArrayInputStream);      InputStreamReader inputStreamReader = new InputStreamReader(gzipInputStream);      BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(inputStreamReader, 4);      while ( ( read = bufferedReader.read() ) != -1 )      {           System.out.println(\"read :\" + read);      } } catch (IOException e) {      e.printStackTrace(); } }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    String myString = \"H4sIAAAAAAAAAO3NoREAMAgEsLedAfafE4+s6l0jolNJiif18tt/Fj8AAMC9ARtYg28AEAAA\";\n    byte[] decode = Base64.decodeBase64(myString);\n    ByteArrayInputStream byteArrayInputStream = new ByteArrayInputStream(decode);\n    GZIPInputStream gzipInputStream;\n    int read;\n    try {\n        gzipInputStream = new GZIPInputStream(byteArrayInputStream);\n        DataInputStream dataInputStream = new DataInputStream(gzipInputStream);\n        while (dataInputStream.available() >= 4) {\n            int gid = dataInputStream.readInt();\n            int x = gid & 0xFFFF;\n            int y = (gid >> 16) & 0xFFFF;\n            System.out.println(\"(\" + x + \",\" + y + \")\");\n        }\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    }\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: \nIn the given code, the base64 decoded and gunzipped data is read using the `InputStream.read` API.
