Then I get InputStream from connected Socket and readed it.

If we consider that port number is always 80 then from what part of this request I must get hostname? Is this GET http://mail.ru/ HTTP/1.1 or Host: mail.ru? Also, can I just send to internet only GET http://mail.ru/ HTTP/1.1 abandoning other parts?Last question is, should I have to rewrite this GET method itself?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: \nString request = \"GET http://mail.ru/ HTTP/1.1\\nHost: mail.ru\\nProxy-Connection: keep-alive\\nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8\\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko)Chrome/31.0.1650.63 Safari/537.36\\nAccept-Encoding: gzip,deflate,sdch\\nAccept-Language: ru-RU,ru;q=0.8,en-US;q=0.6,en;q=0.4\\nCookie: p=7nkAAOS6hAAA; mrcu=7D86524D326C5CB36F898F4A4CD9;_ga=GA1.2.1174941236.1388398432; c=PCwPUwAAAPKbAAAiAgAAcQAAz5QIAgAA;\";\nStringTokenizer tokenizer = new StringTokenizer(request, \"\\n\");\nString firstLine = tokenizer.nextToken();\nString hostLine = tokenizer.nextToken();\nString[] hostLineParts = hostLine.split(\" \");\nString hostname = hostLineParts[1];\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nTo get the hostname from the request, you can use StringTokenizer to split the request into lines.
