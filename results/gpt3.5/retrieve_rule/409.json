As per the requirement I need to iterate over the keySet of the Map and remove objects which dont need any modification.Conside the code below: public void remove(Map<String,User> removeUser){  Set<String> keySet = removeUser.keySey();  User user = null;  for(String key : keySet){      user = (user) removeUser.get(key);       if(!user.isActive()){                removeUser.remove(key);       }  } }Here in above code, I am getting ConcurrentModificationException when I try to fetch User object after Object removal.Can anyone tell me why it's happening?I have not used multi threading.So not able to understand, from where it generated ConCurrentModification Exception.Even I tried with HashMap and Hashtable, but the problem still exist.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next()\n<<<code>>>: The code provided does not use the Iterator.next() method, so it is not relevant to the question.\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The ConcurrentModificationException is being thrown because you are modifying the Map while iterating over it.
