I can't do it in one time so I can't put my arrays in a container. Also the size of my arrays is variable.Secondly, the file is very huge, so I have to split it, in order to read it array by array.How can I do that ? I tried to write line by line my byte arrays  but I haven't been able. How can I put a separator between my arrays and after split it over this separator ?EDIT : I tried this :ByteArrayOutputStream bos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();ObjectOutput out = new ObjectOutputStream(bos);out.writeObject(byteArray);But, I execute this code several times, so the ObjectOutputStream adds each time a new header which corrupt the file.I also try : out.write(byteArray);but I couldn't separate my arrays. So I tried to append a '\\n', which didn't work. After I was looking for library like FileUtils in order to write byte[] line by line but I didn't find.\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: DataOutputStream.write(byte[] b, int off, int len)\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\ntry {\n    FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(\"file.txt\");\n    DataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(fos);\n    \n    // Write byte arrays to the file\n    dos.write(byteArray1, 0, byteArray1.length);\n    dos.write(byteArray2, 0, byteArray2.length);\n    dos.write(byteArray3, 0, byteArray3.length);\n    \n    // Close the DataOutputStream\n    dos.close();\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    // Handle exception\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: \nTo write multiple byte arrays to a file using the DataOutputStream.write method, you can create a FileOutputStream and wrap it with a DataOutputStream.
