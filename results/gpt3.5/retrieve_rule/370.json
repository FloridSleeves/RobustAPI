(other than using an iterator)I'm sure the fact that it's excluded from the API means there's a good reason for not doing this -- could someone please enlighten me?EDIT:Some extremely great answers here, and a few saying \"more context\".  The specific scenario was a dbUnit test, where I could reasonably assert that the returned set from a query had only 1 item, and I was trying to access that item.However, the question is more valid without the scenario, as it remains more focussed:What's the difference between set and list.Thanks to all for the fantastic answers below.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: java.util.Iterator.next()\n<<<code>>>: Iterator<String> iterator = set.iterator();\nString nextElement = iterator.next();\n<<<explanation>>>: The java.util.Iterator interface provides a method called next() which returns the next element in the iteration.
