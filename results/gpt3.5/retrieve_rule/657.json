Iterate through the ArrayList of words.\n3. For each word, check if it already exists in the HashMap using Map.get.\n4. If the word exists, increment its count by 1.\n5. If the word does not exist, add it to the HashMap with a count of 1.\n6. After iterating through all the words, the HashMap will contain the word occurrences.\n\nHere is an example code snippet:\n\n```\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.HashMap;\nimport java.util.Map;\n\npublic class WordCounter {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        ArrayList<String> words = new ArrayList<>();\n        words.add(\"apple\");\n        words.add(\"banana\");\n        words.add(\"apple\");\n        words.add(\"orange\");\n        words.add(\"banana\");\n        words.add(\"apple\");\n\n        Map<String, Integer> wordOccurrences = new HashMap<>();\n\n        for (String word : words) {\n            if (wordOccurrences.containsKey(word)) {\n                int count = wordOccurrences.get(word);\n                wordOccurrences.put(word, count + 1);\n            } else {\n                wordOccurrences.put(word, 1);\n            }\n        }\n\n        for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : wordOccurrences.entrySet()) {\n            System.out.println(entry.getKey() + \": \" + entry.getValue());\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \n1.
