My main function reads off a .txt file filled with employee names, salaries, departments, and positions. My Employee class is just getters and setters. An list of arraylists are made to represent the employees and I'm not sure how I would find the minimum salary of each of the departments. To find the maximum salary I did this in my department class.public class Department {    String dept;    List<Employee> employees;    double minSal;    double maxSal;    public void addEmployee(Employee emp){        maxSal = 0.0;        if (maxSal < emp.getSalary()) {            maxSal = emp.getSalary();        }but I'm not sure how to get the minimum salary. My idea was to get the salary of one of the employees from each department and use that as a starting point for if (minSal > emp.getSalary()) {    minSalary = emp.getSalary();}But I realized I had no idea what to do. Can I get some help with this?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next()\n<<<code>>>: \nTo find the minimum salary of each department, you can iterate over the list of employees in each department and compare their salaries to find the minimum salary. Here's an example code snippet:\n\npublic class Department {\n    String dept;\n    List<Employee> employees;\n    double minSal;\n    double maxSal;\n    \n    public void addEmployee(Employee emp){\n        maxSal = 0.0;\n        if (maxSal < emp.getSalary()) {\n            maxSal = emp.getSalary();\n        }\n        \n        // Initialize minSal with the salary of the first employee\n        if (employees.isEmpty()) {\n            minSal = emp.getSalary();\n        } else {\n            // Iterate over the employees to find the minimum salary\n            Iterator<Employee> iterator = employees.iterator();\n            while (iterator.hasNext()) {\n                Employee employee = iterator.next();\n                if (minSal > employee.getSalary()) {\n                    minSal = employee.getSalary();\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nIn the code snippet, we initialize the minSal variable with the salary of the first employee in the department. Then, we iterate over the remaining employees using an Iterator and compare their salaries with the current minimum salary. If a lower salary is found, we update the minSal variable. This way, at the end of the iteration, minSal will hold the minimum salary of the department.", "gpt_response": {"id": "chatcmpl-8WgY5Y0DbADIU0PoQjask0duQmmyL", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1702800745, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next()\n<<<code>>>: \nTo find the minimum salary of each department, you can iterate over the list of employees in each department and compare their salaries to find the minimum salary.
