Stopwords is the array containing the list of stopwords. The program aims to take each sentence remove the stopwords and save the rest in an array. Here's the code:String[][] trim=new String[sentenceList.size()][largest];    StringTokenizer st1;    for(int i=0;i<sentenceList.size();i++)    {        st1= new StringTokenizer(sentenceList.get(i),\" ,(){}[]/.;:'&?!\");        int count=st1.countTokens();        for(int j=0;j<count;j++)        {            String token=st1.nextToken();            for(int k=0;k<stopwords.length;k++)            {            if(token.equals(stopwords[k]))                continue;            else                trim[i][j]=token;            }                           }     }    //PRINT CHECK    for(int i=0;i<sentenceList.size();i++)    {        for(int j=0;j<largest;j++)        {            if(trim[i][j]!=null)            System.out.print(trim[i][j]+\" \");        }    System.out.println();The confusing element is that the above doesn't work but if I exchange the if and the else part it works and I get only the stopwords.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: The code provided is attempting to tokenize each sentence in the sentenceList ArrayList, remove any stopwords, and store the remaining words in a 2-D array called trim.

This means that if the token doesn't match the first stopword, it will be stored in the trim array. However, if it matches any subsequent stopwords, the trim array will be overwritten with null values.\n\nTo fix this issue, a boolean variable isStopword is introduced to keep track of whether the current token is a stopword or not. If the token matches any stopword, isStopword is set to true and the innermost loop is exited using the break statement. If the token is not a stopword, it is stored in the trim array.\n\nThis ensures that only non-stopwords are stored in the trim array, and the desired result is achieved.", "gpt_response": {"id": "chatcmpl-8WhcefV71mLmPr7QAkMFlxK5mUJ1E", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1702804872, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: The code provided is attempting to tokenize each sentence in the sentenceList ArrayList, remove any stopwords, and store the remaining words in a 2-D array called trim.
