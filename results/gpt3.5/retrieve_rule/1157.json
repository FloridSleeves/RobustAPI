This returns data split by \u00a7. In eclipse, when run as an application, the code works fine. The issue is when I bring it to Android. I have done some research on this but haven't been able to find a working solution. (Have tried Pattern.quote(\"\u00a7\")) Here is an example of what I'm running:String input = \"Look like this\u00a70\u00a725\";String[] data = input.split(\"\u00a7\");The expected data would be a 3-long String[] with the values \"Look like this\", \"0\", and \"25\". This is what happens in eclipse. In android, I get a 1-long String[] with the value \"Look like this\u00a70\u00a725\". Does anyone know if this is an issue with android or am I doing something wrong?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: \nString input = \"Look like this\u00a70\u00a725\";\nStringTokenizer tokenizer = new StringTokenizer(input, \"\u00a7\");\nString[] data = new String[tokenizer.countTokens()];\nint index = 0;\nwhile (tokenizer.hasMoreTokens()) {\n    data[index] = tokenizer.nextToken();\n    index++;\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: In this code, we are using the StringTokenizer API to split the input string using the delimiter \"\u00a7\".
