The problem is that I use plain HTTP to send soap message and javax.xml for parsing response. But some services responds me with mulipart/related and it    requires much more complex logic to parse it (performance matters). So I wonder may I somehow take advantage of apache cxf, apache axiom or any other library for parsing MTOM/XOP SOAP response?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: \nTo parse an MTOM/XOP SOAP response using the InputStream.read API, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a HttpURLConnection object to send the SOAP request and receive the response.\n2. Get the InputStream from the HttpURLConnection object using the getInputStream() method.\n3. Create a byte array to read the data from the InputStream.\n4. Use the InputStream.read() method to read the data from the InputStream into the byte array.\n5. Parse the byte array as per the MTOM/XOP SOAP response format.\n\nHere is an example code snippet:\n\n```\nURL url = new URL(\"http://example.com/soap-endpoint\");\nHttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();\nconnection.setRequestMethod(\"POST\");\nconnection.setRequestProperty(\"Content-Type\", \"text/xml; charset=utf-8\");\nconnection.setDoOutput(true);\n\n// Send the SOAP request\nOutputStream outputStream = connection.getOutputStream();\nString soapRequest = \"<soap:Envelope>...</soap:Envelope>\";\noutputStream.write(soapRequest.getBytes());\noutputStream.flush();\noutputStream.close();\n\n// Receive the SOAP response\nInputStream inputStream = connection.getInputStream();\n\n// Read the data from the InputStream\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\nint bytesRead;\nByteArrayOutputStream byteArrayOutputStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();\nwhile ((bytesRead = inputStream.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n    byteArrayOutputStream.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);\n}\nbyte[] responseBytes = byteArrayOutputStream.toByteArray();\n\n// Parse the responseBytes as per the MTOM/XOP SOAP response format\n// You can use libraries like Apache CXF or Apache Axiom for parsing the responseBytes\n\n// Close the InputStream and HttpURLConnection\ninputStream.close();\nconnection.disconnect();\n```\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nThe code snippet demonstrates how to use the InputStream.read API to read the data from the InputStream obtained from the HttpURLConnection.
