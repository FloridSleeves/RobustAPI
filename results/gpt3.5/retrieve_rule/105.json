Then, you can use the writeInt() and write() methods of DataOutputStream to write the int and byte[] respectively. Finally, you can call the toByteArray() method of ByteArrayOutputStream to obtain the byte array.\n\nIn the code provided, we create an instance of ByteArrayOutputStream called \"baos\". Then, we create an instance of DataOutputStream called \"dos\" and pass \"baos\" as a parameter. Inside the try block, we use dos.writeInt() to write an int and dos.write() to write a byte[]. We wrap these write operations in a try-catch block to handle any IOException that may occur. Finally, we call dos.close() in the finally block to ensure that the DataOutputStream is closed properly.
