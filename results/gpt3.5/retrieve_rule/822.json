I know that java automatically creates a file with f = new Formatter(\"jibberish.txt\");  s = new Scanner(\"jibberish.txt\");if none already exists. But what if one exists and I want to clear it every time I run the program? That is what I am wondering: to say it again how do I clear a file that already exists to just be blank? Here is what I was thinking: public void clearFile(){    //go through and do this every time in order to delete previous crap    while(s.hasNext()){        f.format(\" \");    }} \nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nimport java.io.FileWriter;\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.io.PrintWriter;\n\npublic class ClearFileExample {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        try {\n            PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(\"jibberish.txt\"));\n            writer.write(\"\");\n            writer.close();\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: To clear a file without deleting it, you can use the `PrintWriter.write` method. First, create a `PrintWriter` object with the file name you want to clear. Then, call the `write` method with an empty string as the parameter to overwrite the existing content with an empty string. Finally, close the `PrintWriter` to save the changes.
