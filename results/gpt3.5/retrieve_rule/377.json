The OrientDB contains one unique node with the property \"SPECIAL-NODE\". I want to query the database for this node and print it out. I have one line of code that works using an iterator (see below) and one that does not (below at bottom). It seems like both should work yet only the first does, the second does not. Why is this the case?Thanks!// create Orient graph object and connect to database, works successfullyOrientGraph ograph = new OrientGraph(\"remote:localhost/test\", \"username\", \"password\");// this WORKS - finds the one special node and prints it outIterator<Vertex> i =ograph.getVertices(\"SPECIAL-NODE\", \"SPECIAL\").iterator();System.out.println(i.next());// this DOES NOT WORK. WHY???System.out.println(\"SPECIAL NODE: \" + ograph.getVertexByKey(\"SPECIAL-NODE\",   \"SPECIAL\"));\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: The code that works is:\nIterator<Vertex> i = ograph.getVertices(\"SPECIAL-NODE\", \"SPECIAL\").iterator();\nSystem.out.println(i.next());\n\nThe code that does not work is:\nSystem.out.println(\"SPECIAL NODE: \" + ograph.getVertexByKey(\"SPECIAL-NODE\", \"SPECIAL\"));\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The reason the second code does not work is because the getVertexByKey method returns a single vertex object, not an iterator. Therefore, calling the next method on it will throw an exception because there are no more elements to retrieve. To retrieve a single vertex using the getVertexByKey method, you can directly assign it to a variable and then print it out, like this:\n\nVertex v = ograph.getVertexByKey(\"SPECIAL-NODE\", \"SPECIAL\");\nSystem.out.println(\"SPECIAL NODE: \" + v);", "gpt_response": {"id": "chatcmpl-8WgNFn5jDBIG7Iz8tajZaufOfwKEJ", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1702800073, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: The code that works is:\nIterator<Vertex> i = ograph.getVertices(\"SPECIAL-NODE\", \"SPECIAL\").iterator();\nSystem.out.println(i.next());\n\nThe code that does not work is:\nSystem.out.println(\"SPECIAL NODE: \" + ograph.getVertexByKey(\"SPECIAL-NODE\", \"SPECIAL\"));\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The reason the second code does not work is because the getVertexByKey method returns a single vertex object, not an iterator.
