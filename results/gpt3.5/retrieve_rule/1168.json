This is what I have came up with so far:// split takes some string as the argument, and returns the array// whose elements are the words in the stringpublic static String[] split (String s){    // determine the number of words    java.util.Scanner t = new java.util.Scanner (s);    int countWords = 0;    String w;    while (t.hasNext ())    {        w = t.next ();        countWords++;    }    // create appropriate array and store the string\u2019s words in it    // code here}As you can see, I can just input each word via Scanner.
