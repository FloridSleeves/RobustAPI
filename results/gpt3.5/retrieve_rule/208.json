I want to read it in to a variable like you would see in a hex editor i.e 00 11 21 31 no single numbers as i need to scan the whole file and look for patterns which I know how to do I'm just stuck on this :/so in short i need a variabe to contain the two hex characters i.e int temp = 01 not int temp = 0 , I hope this all makes sense, I'm a little confused as it's 3am!If anyone knows how to do this I would be most greatful, p.s thanks for the help in advance this site has saved me loads of research and have learnt a lot!Many thanks.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>:\n```java\nInputStream in = new FileInputStream(\"file.txt\");\nint read;\nwhile ((read = in.read()) != -1) {\n    String hex = String.format(\"%02X\", read);\n    System.out.println(hex);\n}\nin.close();\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: \nTo read the file as hex, you can use the `InputStream.read` method to read each byte from the file.
