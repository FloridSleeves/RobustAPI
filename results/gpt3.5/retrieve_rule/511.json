Here's a quick sketch of the situation.I have a class Backpack that has a Hashmap content with as keys a variable of type long, and as value an ArrayList with Items. I have to write an Enumeration that iterates over the content of a Backpack. But here's the catch: in a Backpack, there can also be another Backpack. And the Enumeration should also be able to iterate over the content of a backpack that is in the backpack. (I hope you can follow, I'm not really good at explaining..)Here is the code I have:public Enumeration<Object> getEnumeration() {    return new Enumeration<Object>() {        private int itemsDone = 0;        //I make a new array with all the values of the HashMap, so I can use        //them in nextElement()        Collection<Long> keysCollection = getContent().keySet();                    Long [] keys = keysCollection.toArray(new Long[keysCollection.size()]);        public boolean hasMoreElements() {            if(itemsDone < getContent().size()) {                return true;            }else {                return false;            }        }        public Object nextElement() {                           ArrayList<Item> temporaryList= getContent().get(keys[itemsDone]);            for(int i = 0; i < temporaryList.size(); i++) {                if(temporaryList.get(i) instanceof Backpack) {                    return temporaryList.get(i).getEnumeration();                                       }else {                    return getContent().get(keys[itemsDone++]);                }            }        }    };Will this code work decently? It's just the \"return temporaryList.get(i).getEnumeration();\" I'm worried about. Will the users still be able to use just the hasMoreElemens() and nextElement() like he would normally do?Any help is appreciated,Harm De Weirdt\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "api: Iterator.next\ncode: return temporaryList.get(i).getEnumeration();\nexplanation: The code snippet is calling the getEnumeration() method on an object of type Item, which is expected to return an Enumeration.
