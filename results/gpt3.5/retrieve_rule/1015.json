I want to do it in just one line. I know the other ways, convert to char array search for space and delete and all after that but I was wondering if this could be done like \"1.2 sec\" - \" sec\" or like time - \" sec\" or something like that but just in a line or two. If there isn't then I know how to do it. But if there is how?Update:If I execute this code:String time = stopwatch1.getjLabel4text();String replace = time.replace(\" sec\",\"\");System.out.println(replace+\"\");System.out.println(time+\"\");I get output:2.0 Sec2.0 Sec\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String time = stopwatch1.getjLabel4text();\n           StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(time);\n           String result = st.nextToken();\n           System.out.println(result);\n<<<explanation>>>: In this code, we first get the string value from the stopwatch1.getjLabel4text() method and store it in the variable \"time\".
