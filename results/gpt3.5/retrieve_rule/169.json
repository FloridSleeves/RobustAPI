However if my network goes down the the process of reading the file the read method blocks and is never recovers if the network reappears. I was wondering how I should handle this case and should some exception not be thrown if the InputStream goes away. Code is like this. Url someUrl = new Url(\"http://somefile.com\");InputStream inputStream = someUrl.openStream();byte[] byteArray = new byte[];int size = 1024;inputStream.read(byteArray,0,size);So somewhere after calling read the network goes down and the read method blocks. How can i deal with this situation as the read doesn't seem to throw an exception. \nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\ntry {\n    int bytesRead = inputStream.read(byteArray, 0, size);\n    if (bytesRead == -1) {\n        // Handle end of stream\n    } else {\n        // Process the read data\n    }\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    // Handle any IOException that may occur\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: \nTo handle the situation where the network goes down and the `read` method blocks, you can use a try-catch block to catch any `IOException` that may occur. The `read` method returns the number of bytes read, or -1 if the end of the stream has been reached. By checking the value of `bytesRead`, you can determine if the end of the stream has been reached. If `bytesRead` is -1, you can handle the end of the stream accordingly. If `bytesRead` is not -1, you can process the read data as needed.
