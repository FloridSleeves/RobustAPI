I retrieve/read an image from a URL, where the URL does not have a file extension. Then I wish to write/save the image to the local storage, but I have to specify the image file extension (i.e. JPG, PNG, etc.), which I cannot retrieve its extension through the BufferedImage.Could one please point out how it can be done?Any other method will do.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: BufferedImage\n<<<code>>>: \n```\nimport java.awt.image.BufferedImage;\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.io.InputStream;\nimport java.net.URL;\nimport javax.imageio.ImageIO;\n\npublic class ImageExtension {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        try {\n            URL url = new URL(\"https://example.com/image\");\n            InputStream inputStream = url.openStream();\n            BufferedImage image = ImageIO.read(inputStream);\n            \n            String extension = getImageExtension(url);\n            System.out.println(\"Image extension: \" + extension);\n            \n            // Save the image with the retrieved extension\n            ImageIO.write(image, extension, new File(\"image.\" + extension));\n            \n            inputStream.close();\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n    \n    public static String getImageExtension(URL url) {\n        String path = url.getPath();\n        String extension = \"\";\n        \n        int lastDotIndex = path.lastIndexOf(\".\");\n        if (lastDotIndex > 0) {\n            extension = path.substring(lastDotIndex + 1);\n        }\n        \n        return extension;\n    }\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: \nTo get the image extension/type using BufferedImage from a URL, you can use the `getImageExtension` method in the code provided.
