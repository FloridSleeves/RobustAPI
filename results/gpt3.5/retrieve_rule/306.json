Does anyone know of a good way to accomplish the same thing?My motivation for asking is that I have a program that uses interfaces for its API. I want to have one method that returns an iterator of interfaces (for the API) and another that returns an iterator of the implementation classes (for internal use).\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: \nclass Plant { }\nclass Tree extends Plant { }\nclass Maple extends Tree { }\n\nclass MyIterator<T extends Tree> implements Iterator<T> {\n    private int index = 0;\n    private List<T> list = // Get the list from an external source.\n\n    public T next() {\n        T tree = list.get(index++);\n        // Do some processing.\n        return tree;\n    }\n\n    // The other methods of Iterator are easy to implement.\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nIn order to generify the class `MyIterator` with the constraint that `T` should be a superclass of `Maple`, you can use the `extends` keyword instead of `super`.
