When I'm trying to print the list to a file, I go through each object and call the object's respective writer methods.public void writer(String file, boolean append) {    File path = new File(\"../Opdracht6_2/src/\" + file);    try {        PrintWriter write = new PrintWriter(new FileOutputStream(path,                append));        for (SuperObject o : this.list) {            if (o instanceof Object1) {                ((subObject1) w).writer1(file);            }            if (o instanceof Object2) {                ((subObject3) w).writer2(file);                            }if (o instanceof Object3) {                ((subObject3) w).writer3(file);                            }        }        write.close();    } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {        // TODO Auto-generated catch block        e.printStackTrace();    }}In the object's writer method I try to first print a line which says what type it is and then call the writer method for the innerobject. After that I want current object's arguments to be printed and than it goes back to the lists writer methodpublic void writer1(String file) {    File path = new File(\"../Opdracht6_2/src/\" + file);    try {        PrintWriter write = new PrintWriter(                new FileOutputStream(path, true));        //below is the string I want to print before the innerobject appends         //its own arguments to the file        write.append(\"String\\r\\n\");        this.innerobject.innerwriter();        write.append(this objects arg);        write.close();    } catch (IOException e) {        // TODO Auto-generated catch block        e.printStackTrace();    }}The innerobject's writerpublic void innerwriter(String file) {    File path = new File(\"../Opdracht6_2/src/\" + file);    try {        PrintWriter write = new PrintWriter(                new FileOutputStream(path, true));        write.append(this objects arg);        write.close();    } catch (IOException e) {        // TODO Auto-generated catch block        e.printStackTrace();    }}Now the thing that is actually happening is that the line that I'm trying to append first gets appended after the innerobject's arguments even though I have put it before the method that calls the innerobject's writer.It looks like this then in the file:inner objects argstringouter objects argCan someone explain why?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: \nIn the object's writer method:\nwrite.write(\"String\\r\\n\");\nthis.innerobject.innerwriter();\nwrite.write(this objects arg);\n\nIn the innerobject's writer method:\nwrite.write(this objects arg);\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nThe issue you are facing is because you are using the PrintWriter.append method, which appends the specified character sequence to the writer.
