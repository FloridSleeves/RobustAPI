A person have some attributes like name, country, town, zipcode, etc. I wrote the static code, which works very well:Object groupedData = data.stream().collect(groupingBy(Person::getName, Collectors.groupingBy(Person::getCountry, Collectors.groupingBy(Person::getTown))));But the problem is, that is it not dynamic. Sometimes I want to just group by name and town, sometimes by a attributes. How can I do this? Non Java 8 solutions are welcome as well.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: \nTo achieve dynamic grouping, you can use a Map<String, List<Person>> to store the grouped data. You can iterate over the list of persons and manually group them based on the desired attributes.\n\nHere's an example code snippet using the Iterator.next API:\n\n```java\nMap<String, List<Person>> groupedData = new HashMap<>();\n\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\n    Person person = iterator.next();\n    String key = person.getName() + \"-\" + person.getTown(); // Customize the key based on the desired attributes\n    \n    if (!groupedData.containsKey(key)) {\n        groupedData.put(key, new ArrayList<>());\n    }\n    \n    groupedData.get(key).add(person);\n}\n```\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nIn this code, we iterate over the list of persons using the Iterator.next API. For each person, we generate a key based on the desired attributes (in this case, name and town) and check if the key already exists in the groupedData map.

Then, we add the current person to the list associated with the key.\n\nThis way, you can dynamically group the persons based on different attributes by customizing the key generation logic.", "gpt_response": {"id": "chatcmpl-8Wgepw65NSCg549aVuU2y9Bm6NdmH", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1702801163, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: \nTo achieve dynamic grouping, you can use a Map<String, List<Person>> to store the grouped data.
