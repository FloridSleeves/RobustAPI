If an Exception occurs during this process, catch it and close the block for exception handling.\n\nQuestion: How to read a binary file starting from a specific part: :What I did in my code was to simply append a tag then some string data to a binary file using the append flag of FileOutputStream. Now, how do I read starting from the tag specified? I'm not sure where to start. The file and string sizes are variable so I couldn't really trust it. The only thing constant is the tag.EDIT: I forgot to mention that the file will be accessed from another thread/activity/app/device.Code used for appending some data:String TAG = \"CLIPPYDATA-\";String content = \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\"; //size not fixed, sample purpose only.FileOutputStream output = new FileOutputStream(\"/path/to/file\", true);try {        output.write((TAG + content).getBytes());} finally {        //output.flush(); (should I?)        output.close();}Sample output:yyvA\u017e\u00ee\u00e9\u00c3I&8Q\u00c0 \u00d8 +Z\u0160( \u00a2\u0160( \u00a2\u0160(\u00ff\u00d9CLIPPYDATA-The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.Sample input:yyvA\u017e\u00ee\u00e9\u00c3I&8Q\u00c0 \u00d8 +Z\u0160( \u00a2\u0160( \u00a2\u0160(\u00ff\u00d9CLIPPYDATA-The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.Desired Output:CLIPPYDATA-The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: RandomAccessFile.read\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nString filePath = \"/path/to/file\";\nString tag = \"CLIPPYDATA-\";\n\ntry {\n    RandomAccessFile file = new RandomAccessFile(filePath, \"r\");\n    byte[] buffer = new byte[tag.length()];\n    boolean found = false;\n\n    while (!found && file.read(buffer) != -1) {\n        String data = new String(buffer);\n        if (data.equals(tag)) {\n            found = true;\n            byte[] contentBuffer = new byte[(int) (file.length() - file.getFilePointer())];\n            file.read(contentBuffer);\n            String content = new String(contentBuffer);\n            System.out.println(content);\n        }\n    }\n\n    file.close();\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: \nTo read a binary file starting from a specific part, you can use the `RandomAccessFile` class.
