The reason is because I do not have '\\n' at the end of the last sentence but my method adds  numChars += line.length() + 1;However, I cannot find a solution to why I get 0 for words and lines.*My texts includes elements as: ? , - 'After all, could anyone help me to make this work? **So far, I the problem that concerns me is how I can get a number of characters, if the last sentence does not have '\\n' element. Is there a chance I could fix that with an if statement? -Thank you!\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: \npublic class Document {\n    private InputStream inputStream;\n\n    public Document(String documentName) throws FileNotFoundException {\n        File inputFile = new File(documentName);\n        try {\n            inputStream = new FileInputStream(inputFile);\n        } catch (IOException exception) {\n            System.out.println(\"File does not exist\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    public int getChar() throws IOException {\n        int numChars = 0;\n        int data;\n        while ((data = inputStream.read()) != -1) {\n            numChars++;\n        }\n        return numChars;\n    }\n\n    public int getWords() throws IOException {\n        int numWords = 0;\n        boolean isWord = false;\n        int data;\n        while ((data = inputStream.read()) != -1) {\n            char c = (char) data;\n            if (Character.isLetterOrDigit(c)) {\n                isWord = true;\n            } else {\n                if (isWord) {\n                    numWords++;\n                    isWord = false;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        if (isWord) {\n            numWords++;\n        }\n        return numWords;\n    }\n\n    public int getLines() throws IOException {\n        int numLines = 0;\n        int data;\n        while ((data = inputStream.read()) != -1) {\n            char c = (char) data;\n            if (c == '\\n') {\n                numLines++;\n            }\n        }\n        return numLines;\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException, IOException {\n        Document doc = new Document(\"someText.txt\");\n        System.out.println(\"Number of characters: \" + doc.getChar());\n        System.out.println(\"Number of words: \" + doc.getWords());\n        System.out.println(\"Number of lines: \" + doc.getLines());\n    }\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nIn the code provided, the API InputStream.read is used to read data from the input stream.
