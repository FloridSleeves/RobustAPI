If I dont call this method the command line isn't executed.I want to execute more than one command but I can't.Example:\"Call phone\" and then \"terminate\" to end the call whenever I want. But I can only insert the first command line and if I dont use the close() method the command line is not executed.Code:Start a process:ProcessBuilder builder = new ProcessBuilder(PROCESS);builder.redirectErrorStream(true);Process p = builder.start();Read the InputStream of Process:InputStream i = p.getInputStream();System.out.print((char)i.read());while(i.available() > 0){    System.out.print((char)i.read());}Insert command line into OutputStream:String command = com.nextLine();OutputStream o = p.getOutputStream();o.write(comando.getBytes());o.flush();o.close();If I delete \"o.close()\" the command line is not executed, but if I execute it I can't execute the other command lines.I tried the code on my program, but when I insert the command line I dont see the next information of the process.When I put your code :ReadyWarning: video is disabled in linphonec, use -V or -C or -D to enable.linphonec> Registration on sip:XX.XX.XX.XX successful.linphonec> call XXXExemple with my code:ReadyWarning: video is disabled in linphonec, use -V or -C or -D to enable.linphonec> Registration on sip:XX.XX.XX.XX successful.linphonec> call XXXEstablishing call id to sip:XXX@XX.XX.XX.XX, assigned id 1With \"Available > 0\" I get \"Establishing call id to sip:XXX@XX.XX.XX.XX, assigned id 1\".If I use this loop I dont see the other info of the process.I think the problem is that the outputstream does not get the command lines until I execute the Close method.Thank you.Sorry for my bad englando.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>:\n```java\nProcessBuilder builder = new ProcessBuilder(PROCESS);\nbuilder.redirectErrorStream(true);\nProcess p = builder.start();\n\nInputStream i = p.getInputStream();\nOutputStream o = p.getOutputStream();\n\n// Read the output of the process\nint bytesRead;\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\nwhile ((bytesRead = i.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n    System.out.print(new String(buffer, 0, bytesRead));\n}\n\n// Insert command lines into OutputStream\nString command1 = \"call phone\";\nString command2 = \"terminate\";\n\no.write(command1.getBytes());\no.flush();\n\n// Read the output after executing the first command\nwhile ((bytesRead = i.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n    System.out.print(new String(buffer, 0, bytesRead));\n}\n\no.write(command2.getBytes());\no.flush();\n\n// Read the output after executing the second command\nwhile ((bytesRead = i.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n    System.out.print(new String(buffer, 0, bytesRead));\n}\n\no.close();\ni.close();\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: In your code, you are closing the OutputStream after writing the first command, which prevents you from writing any more commands.
