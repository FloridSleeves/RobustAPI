The matlab file that I deploy is in fact a matlab function which have no arguments and return a list of integer. I am running that .exe from java code using process to run my executable file. I am tried to read the return values using the following code:            Process process = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(\"epidemic.exe\");            //process.waitFor();            System.out.println(\"....\");            InputStream in = process.getInputStream();  // To read process standard output            InputStream err = process.getErrorStream(); // To read process error output            while (process.isAlive()) {                while (in.available() > 0 || err.available() > 0) {                    if (in.available() > 0) {                        System.out.print((char)in.read()); // You might wanna echo it to your console to see progress                    }                    if (err.available() > 0) {                        err.read(); // You might wanna echo it to your console to see progress                    }                }                Thread.sleep(1);            }           System.out.println(\"....\");EDIT: Based on the proposed changes I re-change my code. Again, it doesn't seem print the returned values. If this code is ok, how could I check if the executable indeed return values? \nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: \nProcess process = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(\"epidemic.exe\");\nInputStream in = process.getInputStream();\nInputStream err = process.getErrorStream();\n\nwhile (process.isAlive()) {\n    while (in.available() > 0 || err.available() > 0) {\n        if (in.available() > 0) {\n            int value = in.read();\n            System.out.print(value + \" \");\n        }\n        if (err.available() > 0) {\n            err.read();\n        }\n    }\n    Thread.sleep(1);\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nThe code you provided is almost correct.
