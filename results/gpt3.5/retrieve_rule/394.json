Should look like this:select * from customer where customer.id in (34, 26, ..., 2);You can simplify this by reducing this to the question that you have collection of strings and want to create a comma-separated list of this strings in just one string.My approach I have used so far is something like that:String result = \"\";boolean first = true;for(String string : collectionOfStrings) {    if(first) {        result+=string;        first=false;    } else {        result+=\",\"+string;    }}But this is as you can see very ugly. You cannot see what happens there on the first look, especially when the constructed strings (like every SQL query) is getting complicated.What is your (more) elegant way?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: String result = \"\";\n           Iterator<String> iterator = collectionOfStrings.iterator();\n           while (iterator.hasNext()) {\n               result += iterator.next();\n               if (iterator.hasNext()) {\n                   result += \",\";\n               }\n           }\n<<<explanation>>>: \nIn this code, we initialize an empty string called \"result\".
