On some OS's such as XP the command works flawlessly. However, on Windows 7 it only creates the key if you run the compiled jar or classes, and not from an applet on a web page. Additionally on Windows 8, the command does not work at all. I've tried debugging this, and it seems that the REG command is executing successfully. If I run the command manually from command prompt, it creates the keys, with the same output as when it's ran from inside the program. Heres an example of the code:public static int regadd(String key, String name, String val) throws IOException, InterruptedException {    ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder(new String[]{\"REG\", \"ADD\", key, \"/v\", name, \"/d\", val, \"/f\"});    pb.redirectOutput(new File(PathManager.getDirectory(), \"log0.txt\"));    int i = pb.start().waitFor();    Logger.log(\"ADD: \" + i);    return i;}In log0.txt it prints this:The operation completed successfully.Additionally, the \"result\" of the program prints ADD: 0So at this point, I am at a loss of what could be the problem. I am aware of the other dicey ways to add to the registry, but I would like to keep my code compatible with all VM distributions. Is there a way to accomplish this or fix the exiting method?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\npublic static int regadd(String key, String name, String val) throws IOException, InterruptedException {\n    ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder(new String[]{\"REG\", \"ADD\", key, \"/v\", name, \"/d\", val, \"/f\"});\n    pb.redirectOutput(new File(PathManager.getDirectory(), \"log0.txt\"));\n    Process process = pb.start();\n    \n    // Read the output of the process\n    InputStream inputStream = process.getInputStream();\n    byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\n    int bytesRead;\n    while ((bytesRead = inputStream.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n        // Process the data read from the InputStream\n        // ...\n    }\n    \n    int exitCode = process.waitFor();\n    Logger.log(\"ADD: \" + exitCode);\n    return exitCode;\n}\n```\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nTo read the output of the process executed by `ProcessBuilder`, you can obtain the `InputStream` of the process using `Process.getInputStream()`.
