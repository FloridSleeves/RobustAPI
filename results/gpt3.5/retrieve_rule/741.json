On chrome, it directly downloads the file as a *.csv format and when the user opens it, it will use Excel automatically to open the file, if they already have installed and this is the right behavior I wanted to have.However, on firefox, it prompts a save as window with open with and save options. If I use open with option, it tells me the filename is filename.csv but the type is chrome htm file. I haven't mentioned htm anywhere in my code and I dont know why its trying  to open it as htm instead of csv file. Once it tries to open it, it brings excel application and the contents are in a bad format.Is there a way to avoid this problem on firefox ?Thanks\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: response.addHeader(\"Content-Disposition\", \"attachment; filename=my\" + offerType + \"Offers.csv\");\nresponse.setContentType(\"text/csv\");\nresponse.getWriter().write(b.toString());\nresponse.getWriter().flush();\nresponse.getWriter().close();\n<<<explanation>>>: To avoid the problem with Firefox, you can set the content type of the response to \"text/csv\" using the response.setContentType() method. This will ensure that Firefox recognizes the file as a CSV file. Additionally, you should remove the space after \"Content-Disposition:\" in the addHeader() method.
