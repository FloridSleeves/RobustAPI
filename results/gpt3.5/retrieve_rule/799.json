For example:// Execute commandString command = \"cmd /c start cmd.exe\";Process child = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(command);// Get output stream to write from itOutputStream out = child.getOutputStream();out.write(\"cd C:/ /r/n\".getBytes());out.flush();out.write(\"dir /r/n\".getBytes());out.close();The above opens the command line but does not execute cd or dir.
