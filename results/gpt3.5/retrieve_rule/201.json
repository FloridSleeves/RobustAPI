The server is connected to a database.Ok, sorry for that, it's a classic question I'm sure, but I don't know how to start.In a project I worked for they implemented a lot of magic with Proxy.newProxyInstance() to invoke the Glassfish server transparently.I don't want to use a Glassfish server. I just want something simple in plain Java. But the concept of proxies seems pretty cool.Do you have ideas or examples of such thing? How do I write the server part to handle the requests of clients?Thanks in advanceFluminis\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: \nTo create a client-server Java application, you can use sockets to establish communication between the client and server. Here's a basic example to get you started:\n\nServer side:\n1. Create a ServerSocket and bind it to a specific port.\n2. Accept client connections using the accept() method of the ServerSocket.\n3. Create an InputStream from the client socket's InputStream to read data from the client.\n4. Use the InputStream.read() method to read data from the client.\n5. Process the received data as per your application's requirements.\n6. Close the client socket and repeat steps 2-6 to handle multiple clients.\n\nHere's a sample code snippet for the server side:\n\n```java\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.io.InputStream;\nimport java.net.ServerSocket;\nimport java.net.Socket;\n\npublic class Server {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        try {\n            ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(1234);\n            System.out.println(\"Server started. Waiting for clients...\");\n\n            while (true) {\n                Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();\n                System.out.println(\"Client connected: \" + clientSocket.getInetAddress().getHostAddress());\n\n                InputStream inputStream = clientSocket.getInputStream();\n                byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\n                int bytesRead;\n\n                while ((bytesRead = inputStream.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n                    String receivedData = new String(buffer, 0, bytesRead);\n                    System.out.println(\"Received data from client: \" + receivedData);\n                    // Process the received data as per your application's requirements\n                }\n\n                clientSocket.close();\n                System.out.println(\"Client disconnected.\");\n            }\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nClient side:\n1. Create a Socket and connect it to the server's IP address and port.\n2. Create an OutputStream from the socket's OutputStream to send data to the server.\n3. Use the OutputStream.write() method to send data to the server.\n4. Close the socket when done.\n\nHere's a sample code snippet for the client side:\n\n```java\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.io.OutputStream;\nimport java.net.Socket;\n\npublic class Client {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        try {\n            Socket socket = new Socket(\"localhost\", 1234);\n            OutputStream outputStream = socket.getOutputStream();\n\n            String dataToSend = \"Hello server!\";\n            outputStream.write(dataToSend.getBytes());\n\n            socket.close();\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNote: This is a basic example to get you started. In a real-world scenario, you would need to handle exceptions, implement proper error handling, and design a protocol for communication between the client and server.", "gpt_response": {"id": "chatcmpl-8Wg3Y2TVw5YZbkTrOCFqMMtHY9dOL", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1702798852, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: \nTo create a client-server Java application, you can use sockets to establish communication between the client and server.
