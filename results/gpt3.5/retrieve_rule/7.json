I'm a little new to android and this is what I have tried so far: MainActivity.javapackage com.example.alex.myapplication; import android.support.v7.app.ActionBarActivity; import android.os.Bundle; import android.view.Menu; import android.view.MenuItem; public class MainActivity extends ActionBarActivity {@Overrideprotected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);     new Something(this);}@Overridepublic boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {    // Inflate the menu; this adds items to the action bar if it is present.    getMenuInflater().inflate(R.menu.menu_main, menu);    return true;}@Overridepublic boolean onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem item) {    // Handle action bar item clicks here. The action bar will    // automatically handle clicks on the Home/Up button, so long    // as you specify a parent activity in AndroidManifest.xml.    int id = item.getItemId();    //noinspection SimplifiableIfStatement    if (id == R.id.action_settings) {        return true;    }    return super.onOptionsItemSelected(item);}  }Something.javaimport android.view.View;import android.widget.EditText;import android.widget.Button;import android.app.Activity;    public class Something  {  private Activity activity;  private Button add,subtract,multiply,devide;  private EditText editA, editB, editC;  private double doubleA,doubleB,doubleC;      public Something(Activity a){              activity=a;              click();       }       public void click(){           editA = (EditText) activity.findViewById(R.id.editText);           editB = (EditText) activity.findViewById(R.id.editText2);           editC = (EditText) activity.findViewById(R.id.editText3);          doubleA =Double.parseDouble(editA.getText().toString());          doubleB =Double.parseDouble(editB.getText().toString());              add = (Button) activity.findViewById(R.id.add);              subtract = (Button) activity.findViewById(R.id.subtract);              multiply = (Button) activity.findViewById(R.id.multiply);              devide = (Button) activity.findViewById(R.id.devide);               add.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {                   @Override                   public void onClick(View v) {                     doubleC = doubleA+doubleB;                     String s = \"\" + doubleC;                      editC.setText(s);                   }               });               subtract.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {               @Override               public void onClick(View v) {                   doubleC = doubleA-doubleB;                   String s = \"\" + doubleC;                   editC.setText(s);               }           });               multiply.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {               @Override               public void onClick(View v) {                   doubleC = doubleA*doubleB;                   String s = \"\" + doubleC;                   editC.setText(s);               }           });           devide.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {               @Override               public void onClick(View v) {                   doubleC = doubleA/doubleB;                   String s = \"\" + doubleC;                   editC.setText(s);               }           });       }       }So I wasn't sure why my listeners weren't working on my buttons so I tried passing the activity to the class that has the listeners added to the buttons but that didn't work in fact now my application won't even start in the emulator. All I wanted to do was have \"MainActivity\" handle the \"Gui\" and have the \"Something\" class handle the listeners but no matter what I do I can't seem to make them communicate with one another to form one Activity.
