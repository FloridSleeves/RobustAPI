This is working great and I am able to send \"text\" messages back and forth to the server without a problem. Like a chat system.Now I have in mind a way to be able to send files across these client connections to the server, but every single example I see in java always has a hard-coded file name on server / client side - but I want to set my own for flexibility. And I would love if it were not only able to not only receive files but also receive \"text\" messages on the same port simulatanously.I have an idea whereby the \"text\" message port I have at the moment, tells the server a file is going to be sent from a client, then the server opens up a \"file transfer\" port, just for file transfers. That way the \"text\" port could specify the name etc of the file. And the other port could send the files quite happily, without interruption.Does anyone know a better way to do this though? I don't really want to use two ports, it seems a bit messy. I would prefer to make a separate thread on the server side to deal with the file transfer and also deal with \"text\" message at the same time, if this is even possible?Thanks in advance, I hope I have been clear enough :)\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: \nTo handle file transfer and text messages simultaneously over one connection, you can use a single port and manage the communication using different threads. Here's an example of how you can achieve this:\n\n1. Create a server socket and listen for incoming connections on a specific port.\n2. When a client connects, create a new thread to handle the communication with that client.\n3. In the thread, use the InputStream.read method to read data from the client.\n4. If the received data is a text message, process it accordingly.\n5. If the received data is a file transfer request, create a separate thread to handle the file transfer.\n6. In the file transfer thread, open a new file transfer port and notify the client about the port number.\n7. Use the InputStream.read method to read the file data from the client and write it to the specified file on the server side.\n\nHere's a simplified example of how the server-side code could look like:\n\n```java\nServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(1234);\n\nwhile (true) {\n    Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();\n    Thread clientThread = new Thread(() -> {\n        try {\n            InputStream inputStream = clientSocket.getInputStream();\n            byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\n            int bytesRead;\n\n            while ((bytesRead = inputStream.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n                // Process received data\n                String receivedData = new String(buffer, 0, bytesRead);\n                if (receivedData.startsWith(\"FILE_TRANSFER_REQUEST\")) {\n                    // Handle file transfer request\n                    Thread fileTransferThread = new Thread(() -> {\n                        // Open file transfer port and notify client\n                        // Read file data from client and write it to the specified file\n                    });\n                    fileTransferThread.start();\n                } else {\n                    // Handle text message\n                }\n            }\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    });\n    clientThread.start();\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that this is just a basic example to illustrate the concept.
