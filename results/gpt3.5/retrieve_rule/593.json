I know that if i traverse the list to find a certain node it would take O(n) time so I want to map the nodes to an array list where I can access the nodes in O(1) time.I'm really unsure how I would do this mapping. I would like to see an example of how this can be done.Edit:I would like to be able to access any node in the linked list so I can move the nodes around in O(1) time.Example: Move node with ID 5 to end of list in O(1) time. Edit 2: I uploaded a picture example of what I'm trying to accomplish\nPlease using this api: List.get.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: List.get($index)\n<<<code>>>: \n1.

To move a node with ID 5 to the end of the list in O(1) time, you need to find the node in the Doubly Linked List, remove it from its current position, and add it to the end of the list.
