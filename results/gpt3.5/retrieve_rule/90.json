In this case, we are writing the integer value to a file named \"output.bin\". The integer value will be written as a 4-byte value, which is the default size for an integer in Java.\n\nBy using the DataOutputStream.write method, you don't need to manually truncate the integer to fit into a specific number of bytes. The write method takes care of converting the integer value into its binary representation and writing it to the output stream.\n\nNote that the try-with-resources statement is used to automatically close the DataOutputStream after the write operation is complete.
