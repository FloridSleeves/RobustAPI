The following method works fine:BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream(), \"UTF8\"));main.title = in.readLine();but then I need a int java.io.InputStream.read(byte[] b, int offset, int length) method which does not exist for a BufferedReader. So then I tried to take a DataInputStream DataInputStream in2 = new DataInputStream(socket.getInputStream());but everything it reads is just rubbish. Then I tried to use the readLine() method from DataInputStream but this doesn't give me the correct UTF8 string.You see my dilemma. Can't I use two readers for one InputStream? Or can I convert the DataInputStream.readLine() result and convert it to UTF8?Thanks,Martin\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: \nBufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream(), \"UTF8\"));\nchar[] buffer = new char[1024];\nint bytesRead = in.read(buffer, 0, buffer.length);\nString result = new String(buffer, 0, bytesRead);\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nTo read data from an InputStream using the API InputStream.read, you can create a BufferedReader with an InputStreamReader that specifies the UTF8 encoding.
