Just pretend it's there.    public void checkboth(View view) {        CheckBox cb1 = (CheckBox) findViewById(R.id.cb1);        CheckBox cb2 = (CheckBox) findViewById(R.id.cb2);            cb1.setchecked(true);            cb2.setchecked(true);    }    @Override    public void onClick(View v) {    }}But for the life of me I can't figure out why I can't do this:public class MyClass extends Activity implements View.OnClickListener {CheckBox cb1 = (CheckBox) findViewById(R.id.cb1);CheckBox cb2 = (CheckBox) findViewById(R.id.cb2);    //leaving out most code like onCreate. Just pretend it's there.    public void checkboth(View view) {                    cb1.setchecked(true);        cb2.setchecked(true);    }    @Override    public void onClick(View v) {    }}\nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Activity.setContentView\n<<<code>>>: setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n<<<explanation>>>: The method `setContentView` is used to set the content view of an activity to a specified layout resource file.
