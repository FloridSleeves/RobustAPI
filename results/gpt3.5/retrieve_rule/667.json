Here's an example:\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'sinatra'\n\npost '/hello' do\n  text = params[:text]\n  puts \"Received data: #{text}\"\n  # Process the received data here\nend\n```\n\nIn the Java client code, you can modify it to send the data as a form parameter using `HttpURLConnection`. Here's an example:\n\n```java\nprivate static void contactServer() {\n    try {\n        String text = \"This is a text please work\";\n        URL url = new URL(\"http://localhost:4567/hello\");\n        HttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();\n        connection.setRequestMethod(\"POST\");\n        connection.setDoOutput(true);\n        \n        OutputStreamWriter writer = new OutputStreamWriter(connection.getOutputStream());\n        writer.write(\"text=\" + URLEncoder.encode(text, \"UTF-8\"));\n        writer.flush();\n        \n        int responseCode = connection.getResponseCode();\n        System.out.println(\"Response Code: \" + responseCode);\n        \n        writer.close();\n        connection.disconnect();\n        \n        System.out.println(\"done\");\n    } catch (Exception e) {\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the Sinatra server code, you can access the sent data using `params[:text]`.", "gpt_response": {"id": "chatcmpl-8WgweedrWR4tvbOJGlc755uRcDe2J", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1702802268, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: In the Sinatra server code, you can receive the data sent by the Java client using the `params` method provided by Sinatra.
