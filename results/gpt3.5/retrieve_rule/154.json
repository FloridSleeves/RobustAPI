Suppose there are 6 clients connected to the server at the same time and each of the clients are sending some commands to server at the same time. If these clients sending the message to server for every 1 second how can I handle the those messages from the 6 clients on the server side to store it in the table and the acknowledgement to each client. How can i handle these input from from the client. Whether I have to create 6 threads to handle these inputs from the client. Please give me a idea to approach this issue.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>:\n```java\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.io.InputStream;\nimport java.net.ServerSocket;\nimport java.net.Socket;\n\npublic class SocketServer {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        try {\n            ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(8080);\n            System.out.println(\"Server started.
