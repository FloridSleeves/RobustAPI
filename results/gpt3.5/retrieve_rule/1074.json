I dont care about the command token.My code looks like this:String test2 = command.substring(7);StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(test2);String email = st.nextToken();String amount = st.nextToken();\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: \nString test2 = command.substring(7);\nStringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(test2, \" \");\nString email = st.nextToken();\nString amount = st.nextToken();\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nIn order to read an email address as a token, you can use the StringTokenizer class. First, you need to create a StringTokenizer object with the specified string and delimiter. In this case, the delimiter is a space (\" \"). Then, you can use the nextToken() method to obtain the next token as long as there are more tokens available.\n\nIn your code, you are correctly creating a StringTokenizer object with the string \"test2\" and the delimiter \" \". Then, you are using the nextToken() method to obtain the email address token and store it in the variable \"email\". Finally, you are using the nextToken() method again to obtain the number token and store it in the variable \"amount\".", "gpt_response": {"id": "chatcmpl-8WhiXZPy2jBb3lyWWibSzJ3xP38FB", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1702805237, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: \nString test2 = command.substring(7);\nStringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(test2, \" \");\nString email = st.nextToken();\nString amount = st.nextToken();\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nIn order to read an email address as a token, you can use the StringTokenizer class.
