This is because `nextToken()` is called once to skip over the word and then again to save the count as the key. However, since the loop condition `itr.hasMoreTokens()` is not checked after the first `nextToken()` call, it is possible that there are no more tokens available, resulting in the exception.\n\nTo fix this issue, you can modify the code as follows:\n\n```java\npublic void map(Object key, Text value, Context context) throws IOException, InterruptedException {\n    StringTokenizer itr = new StringTokenizer(value.toString());\n    itr.nextToken(); // Skip over first line, which has just one element\n    while (itr.hasMoreTokens()) {\n        itr.nextToken(); // Skip over word\n        if (itr.hasMoreTokens()) { // Check if there are more tokens available\n            count.set(itr.nextToken()); // save count as key\n            context.write(count, one);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBy adding the `if (itr.hasMoreTokens())` condition before calling `nextToken()` to save the count as the key, you ensure that there are more tokens available before attempting to retrieve the count. This will prevent the `NoSuchElementException` from occurring.\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The issue in the code is that the `nextToken()` method is being called twice in the while loop, which is causing the `NoSuchElementException`.
