I want to create a library using JSch from some other apps I am looking to write.  I have the connections ironed out but I am using stdin and stdout right now.I am looking to have a method that accepts a single command in a String and returns an ArrayList with the results.Any assistance would be great!//This vars are in the class.private JSch _jsch;private Session _session;private Channel _channel;Here is my connection methodpublic boolean Connect () throws JSchException{    try {        _jsch = new JSch();        _session = _jsch.getSession(_user, _hostname, _port);              _session.setPassword(_password);        _session.setConfig(\"StrictHostKeyChecking\", \"no\");          _channel = _session.openChannel(\"shell\");        //((ChannelShell)_channel).setPtyType(\"vt100\");        _channel.setInputStream(bais);        _channel.setOutputStream(baos);        _channel.connect(3000);                         }//try to connect    catch (JSchException ex)    {        throw ex;    }    return true;}The goal is once I open the connection I can send this method a command and return the results in an array.  Act based on the results and send more commands.  I don't want to close the connection each time as they will build on the commands that come before it. I am not sure how to work with the Inputs and Output Streams enough to get the results I am looking for.  If you can assist with filling out the following method, I would be grateful.public List<String> ExecuteCommand (String command) {    //run command to existing connection    //Get returned lines to Array List and return the list}Thanks \nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\npublic List<String> ExecuteCommand(String command) throws IOException {\n    List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();\n    OutputStream outputStream = _channel.getOutputStream();\n    InputStream inputStream = _channel.getInputStream();\n    \n    outputStream.write(command.getBytes());\n    outputStream.flush();\n    \n    byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\n    StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder();\n    \n    int bytesRead;\n    while ((bytesRead = inputStream.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n        stringBuilder.append(new String(buffer, 0, bytesRead));\n        if (stringBuilder.toString().endsWith(\"\\n\")) {\n            result.add(stringBuilder.toString().trim());\n            stringBuilder.setLength(0);\n        }\n    }\n    \n    return result;\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: \nIn the `ExecuteCommand` method, we first obtain the output stream and input stream from the `_channel` object.
