I have the \"board\" stored as a 2 dimensional char array. I want to be able to send and receive this array through Sockets. I am currently using a InputStream and OutputStream to send single bytes. However, I don't think this will work for sending the array. Also, these streams only seem capable of sending int type data. Can someone please explain to me how too send 2 dimensional char arrays over sockets using I/O streams. Example code would be great! Thanks. Current Code:public void communicate() {    try {        OutputStream os = client.getOutputStream();        InputStream is = client.getInputStream();    }    while (gameOver == false) {        char[][] board = new char[3][3];        try {            os.write(board); //this dosen't work, only sends non-array int types.         } catch (IOException e) {            e.printStackTrace();        }    }}\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: \npublic void communicate() {\n    try {\n        OutputStream os = client.getOutputStream();\n        InputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    }\n    while (gameOver == false) {\n        char[][] board = new char[3][3];\n        try {\n            for (int i = 0; i < board.length; i++) {\n                for (int j = 0; j < board[i].length; j++) {\n                    int data = is.read();\n                    if (data != -1) {\n                        board[i][j] = (char) data;\n                    } else {\n                        // handle end of stream\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: To send a 2-dimensional char array over sockets using I/O streams, you can use the InputStream.read method to read the data byte by byte.
