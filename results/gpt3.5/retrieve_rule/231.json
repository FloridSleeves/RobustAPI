When I close my exec-channel and session, the \"tail -f ...\" process still stays alive at server side.I tried to do channel.sendSignal(\"KILL\") but it throws an exception:com.jcraft.jsch.JSchException: failed to send channel requesthow can I do a clean disconnect?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: \nTo kill the process before disconnecting, you can try using the `destroy()` method of the `Process` class. Here's an example:\n\n```java\nProcess process = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(\"tail -f server-log.txt\");\n\n// ... code to read from the InputStream ...\n\n// When you want to disconnect and kill the process\nprocess.destroy();\n```\n\nThis will send a termination signal to the process and kill it. Make sure to handle any exceptions that may occur when calling `destroy()`.\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nThe `InputStream.read` API is not directly related to killing a process.
