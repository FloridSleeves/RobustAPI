Further confusing the matter I introduced an intermediate step saving the base64Encoded string out to disk prior to decoding it.  I also then opened the original file (from the Pentaho Side) and encoded that using the Buffer(fs.readFileSync(originalPath)).toString('base64') and compared the base 64 encoded versions of each.  I was hoping to confirm that the algorithm is different (although there is no guarantee). The files themselves were the same length, and started and finished with no differences.  Scattered about the file were bunch of minor differences.  1 byte here 1 byte there.Other bits: Apache.Commons...Base64 uses \"rfc 2045\" Buffer on the Node Js side uses \"rfc 4648\" (I may be misreading the description).
