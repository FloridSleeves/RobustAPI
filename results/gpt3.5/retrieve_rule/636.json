May be not so good if n is quite big I guess...Well, 2 questions:am I understanding good how to \"measure\" the efficiency of the code?there's a better way to count the number of unique pairs in a given array?EDIT:Damn I've just posted and I'm already swamped by answers! Thanks! I'll study each one with care, for the time being I say I don't get those involving HashMap: out of my knowledge yet (hence thanks again for the insight:o) )\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Map.get\n<<<code>>>: \nint numCouples(int[] v) {\n    Map<Integer, Integer> countMap = new HashMap<>();\n    int res = 0;\n    \n    for (int num : v) {\n        countMap.put(num, countMap.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);\n    }\n    \n    for (int count : countMap.values()) {\n        res += count / 2;\n    }\n    \n    return res;\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: \nIn this code, we use a HashMap to store the count of each number in the given array.
