This question needs debugging details. It is not currently accepting answers.                                                             Edit the question to include desired behavior, a specific problem or error, and the shortest code necessary to reproduce the problem. This will help others answer the question.Closed 6 years ago.                        Improve this question                    I wrote a simple calculation program. I want users to enter their request as 12+12 and return the answer. I used StringTokenizer, but I got an error and it doesn't show me any result. There was a mention that Calc is a superclass and MinusCalc and PlusCalc are subclasses. Does anyone have any idea?    void inputLineData() { // This is just the function that use for this case                                    System.out.println(\" Plz enter your all numbers\");    String strAll = key.next();    StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(strAll);    int n1 = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());    String str = st.nextToken();    int n2 =  Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());    switch (str.charAt(0)) {        case '+':            PlusCalc P = new PlusCalc(n1, n2);            listCalc[indexCalc] = P;            indexCalc++;            break;        case '-':            MinusCalc M = new MinusCalc(n1, n2);            listCalc[indexCalc] = M;            indexCalc++;            break;        default:            System.out.println(\"Error!\");      }  }And this is  MinusCalc class:   public class MinusCalc extends Calc {@Overridepublic int func(){    return n1 - n2 ; }public MinusCalc(int n1, int n2) {    super(n1, n2);   } }And this is  PlusCalc class:   public class PlusCalc extends Calc { @Overridepublic int func(){    return n1 + n2;}public PlusCalc(int n1, int n2) {    super(n1, n2);  }}And this is Calc class:    public abstract class Calc {   public Calc(int n1, int n2) { // constructor with parameters!!    this.n1 = n1;    this.n2 = n2;}int n1,n2;public abstract int func();}\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: \n\nvoid inputLineData() {\n    System.out.println(\"Please enter your calculation in the format 'number operator number':\");\n    String strAll = key.nextLine();\n    StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(strAll, \" \");\n    int n1 = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\n    String operator = st.nextToken();\n    int n2 = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\n    \n    switch (operator) {\n        case \"+\":\n            PlusCalc P = new PlusCalc(n1, n2);\n            listCalc[indexCalc] = P;\n            indexCalc++;\n            break;\n        case \"-\":\n            MinusCalc M = new MinusCalc(n1, n2);\n            listCalc[indexCalc] = M;\n            indexCalc++;\n            break;\n        default:\n            System.out.println(\"Error!\");\n    }\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nThe code provided is using the StringTokenizer class to parse the user's input.
