{"api": "StringTokenizer.nextToken", "prompt": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nFor API StringTokenizer.nextToken, the API usage rule is: Create a StringTokenizer with a specified string and delimiter, and then obtain the next token as long as there are more tokens available.\n\nQuestion: Printing each word from a paragraph of words in Java while skipping some using Scanner class: :I am writing a program to take in a file and output a file.The input file contains like:    1 cat dog rabbit    3 cat dog rabbit rabbit rabbit    2 yellow red blue white black    0 three two oneand the output file would be:    dog rabbit rabbit rabbit blue white black three two one(the program takes in the integer at the beginning of each line and then skip the number of words in each line and then save the rest words and output them to a file) Initially, I have import java.util.Scanner;import java.io.FileNotFoundException;import java.io.File;import java.io.PrintWriter;public class Scanner2{    public static void main(String args[]) {        String c = \"\";        try{            File file = new File(args[0]);            Scanner scanner = new Scanner(file);             PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(args[1]);        // as long as the scanner reads that the file has a next line               while (scanner.hasNextLine()) {            // read the next line of string as string s                   String s = scanner.nextLine();         // split each word from the string s as an array called \"words\"                   String[] words = s.split(\" \");        // for loop executed length of \"words\" times                   for(int x = 0; x < words.length; x++) {        // declare int, \"count\"                       int count;        // parse the first element (the number) from \"words\" to be an integer, \"count\"                       count = Integer.parseInt(words[0]);        // if the loop is executed more than \"count\" number of times                       if (x > count){        // add respective element to string, \"c\"                           c += words[x];                           c += \" \";                    }                }            }        // close the scanner            scanner.close();        // output string \"c\" to the output file            writer.println(c);        // close the writer            writer.close();    }        catch (FileNotFoundException e) {            e.printStackTrace();   }         }}and these codes work perfectly. However, now I want to switch from using the split method to another second scanner class to read each sentence to each word.import java.util.Scanner;import java.io.FileNotFoundException;import java.io.File;import java.io.PrintWriter;public class ScannerDemo{     public static void main(String args[]) {        String c = \"\";        try{            File file = new File(args[0]);            Scanner scanner = new Scanner(file);            PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(args[1]);         // as long as the scanner reads that the file has a next line               while (scanner.hasNextLine()) {        // read the first line of string in scanner s2                   Scanner s2 = new Scanner(scanner.nextLine());        // read the first word of first line from s2 as string \"counts\"                   String counts = s2.next();        // parse the string \"counts\" as int, \"count\"                   int count = Integer.parseInt(counts);        // as long as s2 has the next element                   while (s2.hasNext()){        // for loop executed \"count\" number of times to skip the words                       for (int x = 0; x < count; x ++){                           String b = s2.next();                        }       // else add the next words to string, \"c\"                           c += s2.next();                           c += \" \";                        }                    }        // close the scanner            scanner.close();        // output string \"c\" to the output file            writer.println(c);        // close the writer            writer.close();        }        catch (FileNotFoundException e) {            e.printStackTrace();  }   } }However, it gives out error messageException in thread \"main\" java.util.NoSuchElementExceptionI felt this error message is due to the second scanner class not closed properly. However, I did not figure out how to solve it after I added      s2.close();in the for loop.Any help is appreciated.
