When I execute the code I get a \"No file exist\" as the output and no data.txt file is created in the dir.What am I missing?  The odd thing is that it was working fine the other night, but when I loaded it up today to test it out again, this happened.  Here is the code:import java.io.*;import java.util.*;public class DataStreams {    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {        try {            DataOutputStream out = new DataOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(\"C:\\\\data.txt\"));            for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {                out.write(i);            }        } catch (IOException ioe) {            System.out.println(\"No file exist\");        }    }}The data file should be a simple display of numbers 1 through 9.  Thanks for your input.\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: DataOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>: \nimport java.io.*;\n\npublic class DataStreams {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        try {\n            DataOutputStream out = new DataOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(\"C:\\\\data.txt\"));\n            for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {\n                out.write(i);\n            }\n            out.close();\n        } catch (IOException ioe) {\n            System.out.println(\"No file exist\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: \nIn the given code, the issue is that the DataOutputStream is not being closed after writing the data.
