NOTE : At first i tried using ImageIcon to add to JPanel but it could not work hence i found this solution which lead to my current problem. I just starting programming in Java.EDIT: Here are the link to the images and I am doing a Java ApplicationI need an alternative to add a image to a JPanel. \nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: \nIterator<String> iterator = list.iterator();\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\n    String element = iterator.next();\n    // process the element\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The code snippet above demonstrates the usage of the Iterator.next API.
