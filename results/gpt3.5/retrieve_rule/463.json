What would be the most efficient way of accomplishing this task?UPDATE.As you can see the desired order is not alphabetical, that includes reverse. As I mentioned the objective is to group the strings and order them by first appearance. For this example I am using letter to simplify a (lot) more complex problem I am trying to solve. The thing to concentrate with here is the order on which the letter of each string appear. Grouping in a specific order, rather than ordering.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n\n<<<code>>>:\n```java\npublic String orderStrings(String input) {\n    StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();\n    Map<Character, Queue<Integer>> map = new HashMap<>();\n    \n    for (int i = 0;
