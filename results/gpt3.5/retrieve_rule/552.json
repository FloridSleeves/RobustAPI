The type value is long. I am getting values using .values(). Now I want to access these values. Collection val = table.values();Iterator itr = val.iterator();long a  =   (long)itr.next();But when I try to get it, it gives me error because I can't convert from type object to long. How can I go around it?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next()\n<<<code>>>: long a = (long) itr.next();\n<<<explanation>>>: The error occurs because the next() method of the Iterator class returns an object of type Object, and you are trying to cast it directly to a long.
