Closed 10 years ago.I have a string as str=123|apple|apple|apple|dog$i like to seperate string using \"|\" character.    String str = \"123|apple|apple|apple|dog$\";    StringTokenizer strString = new StringTokenizer(str..nextToken(), \"|\");    int i;    while (strString.hasMoreElements()) {        if (i == 0)            str1 = Loginstring.nextToken();        else if (i == 1)            str2 = Integer.Loginstring.nextToken();        else if (i == 2) {            str3 = Loginstring.nextToken();            break;        }        i = i + 1;    }but it exit on first loop onwards(that means it exit from loop if i more than 1),, really i dont know y its happens, whats wrong with it\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: \nString str = \"123|apple|apple|apple|dog$\";\nStringTokenizer strString = new StringTokenizer(str, \"|\");\nint i = 0;\nString str1 = \"\";\nString str2 = \"\";\nString str3 = \"\";\nwhile (strString.hasMoreElements()) {\n    if (i == 0)\n        str1 = strString.nextToken();\n    else if (i == 1)\n        str2 = strString.nextToken();\n    else if (i == 2) {\n        str3 = strString.nextToken();\n        break;\n    }\n    i = i + 1;\n}\nSystem.out.println(\"str1: \" + str1);\nSystem.out.println(\"str2: \" + str2);\nSystem.out.println(\"str3: \" + str3);\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nIn the given code, there are a few issues:\n1.
