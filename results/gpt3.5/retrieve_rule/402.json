I use thread-safe collection and remove items through iterator.

Even though you are using a thread-safe collection, the iterator itself is not thread-safe. The iterator is created in the background thread, but it is being used in the main thread. This can lead to concurrent modifications and cause the exception.\n\nTo fix this issue, you can either:\n1. Move the entire removeNonApplicableActions method to the background thread where the iterator is created and used. This ensures that the iterator is used in the same thread where it was created.\n2. Use a thread-safe iterator implementation, such as the java.util.concurrent.CopyOnWriteArrayList, instead of the regular ArrayList. This will allow modifications to the list while iterating without throwing a ConcurrentModificationException.\n\nHere's an example of how you can modify the code using the CopyOnWriteArrayList:\n\nprivate List<IStartAction> mActions = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<>();\n\nprotected void removeNonApplicableActions() {\n    Iterator<IStartAction> iterator = mActions.iterator();\n    while (iterator.hasNext()) {\n        IStartAction action = iterator.next();\n        if (!action.isApplicable()) {\n            iterator.remove();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nBy using the CopyOnWriteArrayList, modifications to the list will not affect the iterator and you will not encounter the ConcurrentModificationException.", "gpt_response": {"id": "chatcmpl-8WgQ57mEqMRcnI66dGm8youo0jdqF", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1702800249, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: The code is using the Iterator.next method to iterate over the elements in the mActions list and remove non-applicable actions.\n<<<explanation>>>: The ConcurrentModificationException is occurring because the mActions list is being modified while the iterator is still active.
