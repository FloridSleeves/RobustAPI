Here's an example of how you can achieve function composition using the Iterator.next() method:\n\n1. Create a LazySequence class that implements the Iterator interface and holds a reference to the original sequence and the current function to be applied.\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Iterator;\nimport java.util.function.Function;\n\npublic class LazySequence<T> implements Iterator<T> {\n    private Iterator<T> originalSequence;\n    private Function<T, T> currentFunction;\n\n    public LazySequence(Iterator<T> originalSequence) {\n        this.originalSequence = originalSequence;\n        this.currentFunction = Function.identity(); // default function is identity\n    }\n\n    public void map(Function<T, T> function) {\n        currentFunction = currentFunction.andThen(function);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public boolean hasNext() {\n        return originalSequence.hasNext();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public T next() {\n        T nextElement = originalSequence.next();\n        return currentFunction.apply(nextElement);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n2. Use the LazySequence class to create a lazy sequence and apply multiple map operations:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Arrays;\nimport java.util.Iterator;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Iterator<Integer> originalSequence = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5).iterator();\n\n        LazySequence<Integer> lazySequence = new LazySequence<>(originalSequence);\n        lazySequence.map(x -> x * 2);\n        lazySequence.map(x -> x + 1);\n\n        while (lazySequence.hasNext()) {\n            System.out.println(lazySequence.next());\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the LazySequence class holds the original sequence and the current function to be applied. The map() method composes the current function with the new function using the andThen() method of the Function interface. The next() method applies the current function to the next element of the original sequence.\n\nThe Main class demonstrates how to create a lazy sequence and apply multiple map operations. The output will be the result of applying the composed functions to each element of the original sequence.\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The LazySequence class implements the Iterator interface and uses the next() method to apply the current function to the next element of the original sequence.
