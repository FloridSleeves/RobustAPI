Here is an example of how you can use the Iterator.next API to retrieve data from an Excel spreadsheet:\n\n1. First, you need to add the Apache POI dependency to your project. You can do this by adding the following Maven dependency to your pom.xml file:\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>org.apache.poi</groupId>\n    <artifactId>poi</artifactId>\n    <version>4.1.2</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n\n2. Once you have added the dependency, you can start parsing the Excel data. Here is an example code snippet:\n\n```java\nimport org.apache.poi.ss.usermodel.*;\n\npublic class ExcelParser {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        try {\n            // Load the Excel file\n            Workbook workbook = WorkbookFactory.create(new File(\"path/to/your/excel/file.xlsx\"));\n\n            // Get the first sheet\n            Sheet sheet = workbook.getSheetAt(0);\n\n            // Iterate over the rows\n            Iterator<Row> rowIterator = sheet.iterator();\n            while (rowIterator.hasNext()) {\n                Row row = rowIterator.next();\n\n                // Iterate over the cells in the row\n                Iterator<Cell> cellIterator = row.cellIterator();\n                while (cellIterator.hasNext()) {\n                    Cell cell = cellIterator.next();\n\n                    // Get the cell value based on its type\n                    switch (cell.getCellType()) {\n                        case STRING:\n                            String cellValue = cell.getStringCellValue();\n                            // Do something with the cell value\n                            break;\n                        case NUMERIC:\n                            double numericCellValue = cell.getNumericCellValue();\n                            // Do something with the numeric cell value\n                            break;\n                        // Handle other cell types as needed\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n\n            // Close the workbook\n            workbook.close();\n        } catch (IOException | InvalidFormatException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nIn this code, we use the Apache POI library to load the Excel file and retrieve the data from it.
