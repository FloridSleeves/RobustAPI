The \"ride.in\" file contains two lines, one containing the string \"COMBO\" and the other line containing the string \"ADEFGA\".  As I said, each string is on separate lines, so \"COMBO\" is on the first line, while \"ADEFGA\" is on the second line in the \"ride.in\" file.Here is my code: public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {File in = new File(\"ride.in\");File out = new File(\"ride.out\");String line;in.createNewFile();out.createNewFile();BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(in));PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(out)));while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {    StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(line);    String sam =st.nextToken();}pw.close();}    }I want to assign COMBO as one token and ADEFGA as another token, but in this code, both COMBO and ADEFGA are assigned to the sam string. How do I assign COMBO to one string, and ADEFGA to another string?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: \npublic static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n    File in = new File(\"ride.in\");\n    File out = new File(\"ride.out\");\n    String line;\n    in.createNewFile();\n    out.createNewFile();\n    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(in));\n    PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(out)));\n    StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n    String combo = st.nextToken();\n    st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n    String adefga = st.nextToken();\n    pw.close();\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nTo assign \"COMBO\" to one string and \"ADEFGA\" to another string, you need to create a new StringTokenizer for each line and obtain the next token from each StringTokenizer separately.
