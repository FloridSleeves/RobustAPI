My problem is that I am having trouble figuring out how to grab a specific piece of data out of a line with a buffered file reader. I know how to get the line, but parsing the data is the mystery. I have placed my code below in case it may help give more context. Thanks!EDIT: Please bear with me. I'm literally within my first month of learning Java. I have to use buffered reader. This is a school project. Am I supposed to use \"split\"? If so can I store the \"next split\" or something into and array?listings.txtInt           string(?) double   intPropertyID    Type    Cost     AgentID --(Not in the file.
