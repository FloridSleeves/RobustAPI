Here is an example code snippet:\n\n```java\ntry {\n    FileInputStream fileInputStream = new FileInputStream(\"file.txt\");\n    int bit;\n    \n    while ((bit = fileInputStream.read()) != -1) {\n        // Process the bit here\n        System.out.print(bit);\n    }\n    \n    fileInputStream.close();\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n```\n\nTo write bits to a file, you can use the FileOutputStream class along with the OutputStream.write method. Here is an example code snippet:\n\n```java\ntry {\n    FileOutputStream fileOutputStream = new FileOutputStream(\"file.txt\");\n    int bit = 1;\n    \n    fileOutputStream.write(bit);\n    \n    fileOutputStream.close();\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n```\n\nNote that in Java, the smallest unit of data you can read or write is a byte, not a bit. So, you will need to handle the conversion between bits and bytes yourself.\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nTo read bits from a file in Java, you can use the FileInputStream class along with the InputStream.read method.
