I expected it to give me the next CStick in my CStickChart (hence when I call the getEPIC I was expecting it to give me the next EPIC along).// Print the EPIC out of the Array using the iteratorfor (CStick localCStick : testCStickChart) {  System.out.println(localCStick.getEPIC());  //The below line doesn't return the next CStick and I'm not sure why  System.out.println(\"next EPIC is \" + testCStickChart.iterator().next().getEPIC());}Please could someone explain why this is not the case (it always returns the first EPIC)\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next()\n<<<code>>>: The issue in your code is that you are creating a new iterator object inside the for loop every time you call `testCStickChart.iterator().next()`. This means that you are always starting from the beginning of the iterator and getting the first element.\n\nTo fix this, you should create the iterator object outside the for loop and use the same iterator object to get the next element.\n\nHere is the corrected code:\n\nIterator<CStick> iterator = testCStickChart.iterator();\nfor (CStick localCStick : testCStickChart) {\n  System.out.println(localCStick.getEPIC());\n  System.out.println(\"next EPIC is \" + iterator.next().getEPIC());\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: In your original code, you were creating a new iterator object `testCStickChart.iterator()` inside the for loop every time you called `next()`.
