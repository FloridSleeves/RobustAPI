However, when I try to write it to a file, the file is empty.PrintWriter writer = null;writer = new PrintWriter(\"grep__output\", \"UTF-8\");writer.println(s);writer.close();Also, I tried to directly writing to file in the above while (previously creating the file), but it's the same.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: \nPrintWriter writer = null;\ntry {\n    writer = new PrintWriter(\"grep_output.txt\", \"UTF-8\");\n    String s = null;\n    while ((s = stdInput.readLine()) != null) {\n        writer.write(s);\n        writer.write(System.lineSeparator());\n    }\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    // Handle exception\n} finally {\n    if (writer != null) {\n        writer.close();\n    }\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: In this code, we create a PrintWriter object to write the output of the grep command to a file.
