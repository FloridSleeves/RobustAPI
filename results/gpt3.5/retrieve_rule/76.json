I have never really worked with networking too much, so the issue is figuring out how to send packets correctly. I am currently at the position of creating the handshake with the server. After hours of research, I have come up with the following code, but it always runs into the \"Failed! (Exception)\" message. To me, everything looks correct, but for all I know it could be 100% wrong. If someone could point out what I'm doing wrong here, I'd really appreciate it.For reference, feel free to use this and this.public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {    host = new InetSocketAddress(\"162.244.165.111\", 48040);    socket = new Socket();    System.out.println(\"Connecting...\");    socket.connect(host, 3000);    System.out.println(\"Done!\");    System.out.println(\"Making streams...\");    output = new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());    input = new DataInputStream(socket.getInputStream());    System.out.println(\"Done!\");    System.out.println(\"Attempting handshake... \"+host.getAddress().toString().substring(1));    byte[] msg = (\"47;\"+host.getAddress().toString().substring(1)+\";\"+host.getPort()+\";2;\").getBytes(Charset.forName(\"UTF-16\"));    output.writeInt(msg.length+Integer.valueOf(0x00));    output.writeByte(0x00);    output.write(msg);    output.flush();    try {        if (input.readByte() != 0x02)            System.out.println(\"Failed!\");        else            System.out.println(\"Done!\");    } catch (EOFException e) {        System.out.println(\"Failed! (Exception)\");    }}EDIT:More research suggests I use a Byte array, but this confuses me on how to represent a string and using strings is required?\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: DataOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>: \noutput.writeInt(msg.length+Integer.valueOf(0x00));\noutput.writeByte(0x00);\noutput.write(msg);\noutput.flush();\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nThe code is using the DataOutputStream.write method to send the handshake packet to the Minecraft server. \n\nFirst, it writes the length of the message plus the value of 0x00 as an integer using the writeInt method.
