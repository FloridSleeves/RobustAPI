I currently get the raster in a byte[] from the BufferedImage and then ship this through a plain OutputStream to the device. This works fine and I get the same byte array on the Android side. When I call Bitmap.decodeByteArray() however, I only get null. Here is the code I have to send my picture in Java. The image type of the BufferedImage is TYPE_4BYTE_ABGR byte[] imgBytes =    ((DataBufferByte)msg.getImage().getData().getDataBuffer()).getData();lineBytes = (String.valueOf(imgBytes.length) + '\\n').getBytes();        out.write(lineBytes);out.write(imgBytes);out.write((int)'\\n');out.flush();The first thing I write out is the size of the image so I know how big to make the byte[] on Android.Here's the code I'm trying to use to create the Android Bitmap.currLine = readLine(in);int imgSize = Integer.parseInt(currLine);byte[] imgBytes = new byte[imgSize];in.read(imgBytes);BitmapFactory.Options imgOptions = new BitmapFactory.Options();imgOptions.inPreferredConfig = Bitmap.Config.ARGB_4444;Bitmap img = BitmapFactory.decodeByteArray(imgBytes, 0, imgSize, imgOptions);The bytes arrive fine.. They just don't work for the Bitmap.\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: DataOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>: \n```\nbyte[] imgBytes = ((DataBufferByte) msg.getImage().getData().getDataBuffer()).getData();\nlineBytes = (String.valueOf(imgBytes.length) + '\\n').getBytes();\nout.write(lineBytes);\nout.write(imgBytes);\nout.write((int)'\\n');\nout.flush();\n```\n```\ncurrLine = readLine(in);\nint imgSize = Integer.parseInt(currLine);\nbyte[] imgBytes = new byte[imgSize];\nin.read(imgBytes);\nBitmapFactory.Options imgOptions = new BitmapFactory.Options();\nimgOptions.inPreferredConfig = Bitmap.Config.ARGB_4444;\nBitmap img = BitmapFactory.decodeByteArray(imgBytes, 0, imgSize, imgOptions);\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: The code provided seems to be correct for sending the image data from the Java application to the Android device.
