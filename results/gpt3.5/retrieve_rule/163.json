Client will keep streaming data requests to my server app through the socket. Request is a POST with a binary payload which needs to be copied to a byte array which i need to use to get the protocol buffer class.POST / HTTP/1.1Host: 127.0.0.1:80Accept-Encoding: identityContent-Length: 423Content-type: application/octet-stream[PAYLOAD]val out = new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream())val in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()))Any ideas ?
