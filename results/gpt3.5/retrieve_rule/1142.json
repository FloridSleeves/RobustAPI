However, the two first lines of this data file both contain a String.

In this case, it means that there is only one token on the first line of the file, and the code is trying to read a second token that doesn't exist.\n\nTo fix this issue, you should check if there are more tokens available before trying to read them. You can use the `hasMoreTokens()` method of StringTokenizer to check if there are more tokens available.

If there is, it reads the second token and performs the desired logic.
