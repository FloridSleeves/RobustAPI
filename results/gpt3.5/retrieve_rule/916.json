Unfortunately, the plugin does not work as expected - VCard changes are propogated into the database (ofVcard table), but neither the user whose userpic was updated nor his buddies see the refreshed image. Here is how I create/update the VCards:   ...   XMPPServer server = XMPPServer.getInstance();   VCardManager vcardManager = server.getVCardManager();public void createOrUpdateVcard(String username, String vcard)                              throws Exception {                    SAXReader reader = new SAXReader();                    reader.setValidation(false);                    // convert String into InputStream                    InputStream is = new ByteArrayInputStream(vcard.getBytes());                    // read it with BufferedReader                    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(is));                    try {                              // Reading malformed XML will lead to DocumentException                              Document document = reader.read(is);                              Element vCardElement = document.getRootElement();                              log.info(\"Username: \" + username);                              vcardManager.setVCard(username, vCardElement);                    } catch (DocumentException e) {                              throw new MalformedXmlException(e);                    }     }     ...When I change avatars directly from the client (we are using Jitsi), the changes are not only immediately stored in the database, but all the buddies get the refreshed image. I see that VCardManager, which I use, dispatches events internally:VCardEventDispatcher.dispatchVCardUpdated(username, newvCard);but they seem not to have any effect.I cannot figure out what is the difference between the way the setVcard method is called from the handleIQ(IQ packet) in IQvCardHandler and in my own code.
