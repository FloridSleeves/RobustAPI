To test my code, I have tried to hardcode the path of SD card like,File file = new File(\"/storage/632E-1AFA/Champion.mp4\");But now I want to make this app run on multiple devices. So I want a universal method to get the external SD card path. I have tried the getExternalStorageDirectory method but it points to the internal storage of the phone. The getExternalFilesDir points to your internal application files. I have also tried the System.getenv() method with the help of - Android Open External Storage directory(sdcard) for storing file and Find an external SD card location but it is returning a null path when I tried to debug the code.My app includes both the read and write permissions for external storage:<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\" /><uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\" />I am testing my app on Android 6.0, so I have included the run-time permissions as well. Please if someone could help me find a method or an approach that would get the path of an external sd card to run on multipe mobile devices, I would greatly appreciate it.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nString path = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().getPath();\nStringTokenizer tokenizer = new StringTokenizer(path, \"/\");\nString sdCardPath = \"\";\nwhile (tokenizer.hasMoreTokens()) {\n    String token = tokenizer.nextToken();\n    if (token.contains(\"-\")) {\n        sdCardPath = \"/\" + token;\n        break;\n    }\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: \nTo get the external SD card path in Android version 4.0+, you can use the `StringTokenizer.nextToken` API along with the `Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().getPath()` method. \n\nFirst, you retrieve the path of the external storage using `Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().getPath()`. \n\nThen, you create a `StringTokenizer` object with the path and \"/\" as the delimiter. \n\nNext, you iterate through the tokens using a while loop and check if the token contains \"-\".
