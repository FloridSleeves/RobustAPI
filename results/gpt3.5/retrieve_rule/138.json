As you can see from the code, thatString is created only once, but then used multiple times from both threads.Shouldn't the threads be using just a reference to the String rather than copying it? (which would, in this case, exceed the 40MB allowance).I must also point out that it is (or at least seems to be, as far as my understanding goes) impossible to increase this heap space on Gingerbread (previous research).Is there anything I'm missing?Any help is greatly appreciated.\nPlease using this api: FileChannel.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: FileChannel.write\n<<<code>>>: The code is attempting to write data to a FileChannel using a ByteBuffer.
