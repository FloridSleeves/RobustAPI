The server will send bytes to the client by calling DataOutputStream's write(bytes[] b), the DataOutputStream is wrapped around client.getOutputStream directly(no Buffer here).   This is a file download functionality And I'm going to support resume, I didn't use any HTTP here, I've implemented my own simple protocol.  I've seen these questions on SO :1-question1.2-C# question.3-FileChannel question.   The first doesn't answer my question, I can't wrap DataOutputStream around ByteArrayOutputStream because the latter can't be wrapped around client.getOutputStream and I don't know how to implement my own write(int i) method(And don't want to use JNI).   the second is C# not java(and it's calling WIN API anyway, I'm a linux user by the way :) ).   The third is talking about FileChannels and HTTP, As I said I'm not using HTTP and I'm using java Socket's API.  So how to get how many bytes were actually written ?PS (EDIT)By resume support I mean I'll give the client the ability to stop download at specific byte and then after a while(minutes,hours,days,whatever) he/she can resume download from where it has left.   \nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: DataOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nDataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(client.getOutputStream());\ndos.write(bytes);\nint bytesWritten = dos.size();\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: To get the number of bytes that were actually written by the DataOutputStream, you can use the `size()` method after calling `write(bytes)`.
