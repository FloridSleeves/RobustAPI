I have a method called endOfTurn which is called when the player wants to finish their turn, It sets the 'currentPlayerTurn' field to the next player in the Map. However once I reach the end of my map i want it to go back to the first player in the map and go round again and again. Is there a way of doing this? Also yes the players data structure does need to be a map!public class Game {private Map<String,Player> players;private Player currentPlayerTurn;public boolean EndOfTurn(Player currentPlayerTurn) {    //need to set this.currentPlayerTurn to the next player in the Map}I have looked into using an iterator but this doesnt seem to have a reset function or a 'loop around' mode. Any ideas?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: \npublic boolean EndOfTurn(Player currentPlayerTurn) {\n    Iterator<String> iterator = players.keySet().iterator();\n    while (iterator.hasNext()) {\n        String playerName = iterator.next();\n        if (players.get(playerName) == currentPlayerTurn) {\n            if (iterator.hasNext()) {\n                this.currentPlayerTurn = players.get(iterator.next());\n            } else {\n                this.currentPlayerTurn = players.get(players.keySet().iterator().next());\n            }\n            return true;\n        }\n    }\n    return false;\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: \nTo continuously loop/iterate around the Map, you can use the Iterator.next API. In the EndOfTurn method, you can create an iterator for the keys of the players Map using players.keySet().iterator(). Then, you can iterate through the keys and check if the current player matches the currentPlayerTurn. If it does, you can check if there is a next key using iterator.hasNext(). If there is a next key, you can set the currentPlayerTurn to the player associated with the next key using players.get(iterator.next()). If there is no next key, you can set the currentPlayerTurn to the player associated with the first key using players.get(players.keySet().iterator().next()). Finally, you can return true if the currentPlayerTurn was successfully updated, or false if it was not found in the Map.", "gpt_response": {"id": "chatcmpl-8Wggj0wMbclTWCanKOeJ2Mw4dNNhe", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1702801281, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: \npublic boolean EndOfTurn(Player currentPlayerTurn) {\n    Iterator<String> iterator = players.keySet().iterator();\n    while (iterator.hasNext()) {\n        String playerName = iterator.next();\n        if (players.get(playerName) == currentPlayerTurn) {\n            if (iterator.hasNext()) {\n                this.currentPlayerTurn = players.get(iterator.next());\n            } else {\n                this.currentPlayerTurn = players.get(players.keySet().iterator().next());\n            }\n            return true;\n        }\n    }\n    return false;\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: \nTo continuously loop/iterate around the Map, you can use the Iterator.next API.
