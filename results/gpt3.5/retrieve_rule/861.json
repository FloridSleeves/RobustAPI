Here's a breakdown of what the code does:\n\n1. `account = file.readInt();`: This line reads an integer value from the file and assigns it to the 'account' variable.\n\n2. `byte b1[] = new byte[15];`: This line creates a byte array of size 15.\n\n3. `file.readFully(b1);`: This line reads 15 bytes from the file and stores them in the byte array 'b1'.\n\n4. `firstName = new String(b1, 0);`: This line creates a new String object using the byte array 'b1' starting from index 0.\n\n5. `firstName = firstName.trim();`: This line removes any leading or trailing whitespace from the 'firstName' string.\n\n6. `byte b2[] = new byte[15];`: This line creates another byte array of size 15.\n\n7. `file.readFully(b2);`: This line reads 15 bytes from the file and stores them in the byte array 'b2'.\n\n8. `lastName = new String(b2, 0);`: This line creates a new String object using the byte array 'b2' starting from index 0.\n\n9. `lastName = lastName.trim();`: This line removes any leading or trailing whitespace from the 'lastName' string.\n\n10. `balance = file.readDouble();`: This line reads a double value from the file and assigns it to the 'balance' variable.\n\nThe reason why the code reads into different byte arrays for 'firstName' and 'lastName' is because they are separate fields in the file. The code assumes that the first 15 bytes in the file correspond to the 'firstName' field, and the next 15 bytes correspond to the 'lastName' field.\n\nThe readFully() method reads the specified number of bytes from the file into the byte array. If the number of bytes read is less than the length of the byte array, it means that the end of the file has been reached. In this case, the remaining elements of the byte array will contain the default values (0 for byte).\n\nThe RandomAccessFile.write() method, on the other hand, is used to write data to a RandomAccessFile.
