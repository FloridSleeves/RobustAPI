If the file were an image I would do something like this normally to show all applications capable of viewing the image.Intent intent = new Intent();intent.setAction(android.content.Intent.ACTION_VIEW);intent.setDataAndType(Uri.fromFile(file), \"image/*\");context.startActivity(intent);However say I have an unknown file how could I list all applications able to view a file so the user can select the appropriate application to open the file in my application.I also need the titles listed in an arraylist if possible so I can list them in a listview. Thank you for any help with getting a list of applications capable of viewing a file===================================EditAlright well something easier how can i get the applications from the above intent into an arraylist i could just do image/* audio/* etc and add them all to a list and then list them in a listview and that would solve my problem\nPlease using this api: ApplicationInfo.loadIcon.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: ApplicationInfo.loadIcon\n<<<code>>>: \nPackageManager packageManager = getPackageManager();\nIntent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW);\nintent.setData(Uri.fromFile(file));\nList<ResolveInfo> resolveInfoList = packageManager.queryIntentActivities(intent, 0);\nArrayList<String> appTitles = new ArrayList<>();\nfor (ResolveInfo resolveInfo : resolveInfoList) {\n    String appTitle = resolveInfo.loadLabel(packageManager).toString();\n    appTitles.add(appTitle);\n}\n// Now you have the list of application titles in the appTitles ArrayList.\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nTo get the list of applications capable of viewing a file, you can use the PackageManager's queryIntentActivities() method.
