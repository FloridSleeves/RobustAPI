It begins with \"1\" but when I find the word second time , the key increments and then the put method inserts a new entry with a new keyBut i would like to have only one entry and modify the key.Can this be done?How can i have only one object in a HashMap and modify the key every time?   DocsCollection.put(2,\"foo.txt,hello.txt\"); Thanks, in advance\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Map.get\n<<<code>>>: \nTo modify the key in a HashMap and have only one entry/object, you can follow these steps:\n1.

Modify the value by appending the new file name.\n4. Update the value in the HashMap using the Map.put() method with the same key and the modified value.\n5.
