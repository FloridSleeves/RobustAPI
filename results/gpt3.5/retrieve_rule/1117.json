You may have recently seen a post by me looking for help, but I did it wrong before, so I am going to start fresh and begin at the basics.I am trying to read a text file that looks like this:FTFFFTTFFTFT  3054 FTFFFTTFFTFT  4674 FTFTFFTTTFTF  ... etcWhat I need to do is put the first line into a String as the answer key.Next, I need to create an array with the student ID (the first numbers).Then, I need to create an array that is parallel to the student ID that contains the student's answers.Below is my code, and I can't quite figure out how to get it to work like this, and I was wondering if someone could help me out with it.public static String[] getData() throws IOException {      int[] studentID = new int[50];      String[] studentAnswers = new String[50];      int total = 0;      String line = reader.readLine();      strTkn = new StringTokenizer(line);      String answerKey = strTkn.nextToken();      while(line != null) {        studentID[total] = Integer.parseInt(strTkn.nextToken());        studentAnswers[total] = strTkn.nextToken();        total++;      }    return studentAnswers;    }So at the end of the day, the array structure should look like:studentID[0] = 3054studentID[1] = 4674... etcstudentAnswers[0] = FTFFFTTFFTFTstudentAnswers[1] = FTFTFFTTTFTFThanks :)\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\npublic static String[] getData() throws IOException {\n    int[] studentID = new int[50];\n    String[] studentAnswers = new String[50];\n    int total = 0;\n    String line = reader.readLine();\n    StringTokenizer strTkn = new StringTokenizer(line);\n    String answerKey = strTkn.nextToken();\n    while(line != null) {\n        studentID[total] = Integer.parseInt(strTkn.nextToken());\n        studentAnswers[total] = strTkn.nextToken();\n        total++;\n    }\n    return studentAnswers;\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: \nIn the given code, the `getData()` method reads a text file and extracts the student ID and student answers using the `StringTokenizer` API.

Use `strTkn.nextToken()` again to extract the next token from `strTkn`, which is the student's answer. Assign this value to the `studentAnswers` array at the index `total`.\n8. Increment the `total` variable to move to the next index in the arrays.\n9. Repeat steps 6-8 until there are no more tokens in the `line`.\n10.
