My code looks something like this:public class FooIterator<E> implements Iterator<E> {  public FooIterator(Collection<Bar> bars) {    innerIterator = bars.iterator();  }  @Override  public boolean hasNext() {    return innerIterator.hasNext();  }  @SuppressWarnings(\"unchecked\")  @Override  public E next() {    Bar bar = innerIterator.next();    return new E(bar);  }  @Override  public void remove() {    throw new UnsupportedOperationException(\"Don't remove from FooIterator!\");  }  private Iterator<Bar> innerIterator;}...except, of course, this doesn't work because I can't instantiate a new E from a Bar.I would only ever use this with an E that has a constructor that takes a Bar. Is there any way to \"prove\" that to the compiler, or to just throw a runtime error if E doesn't have an appropriate constructor?Or perhaps I'm just not using the right design pattern here? I've been doing a lot of C++ recently, and I feel like I might be approaching this the wrong way.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: \npublic class FooIterator<E extends Bar> implements Iterator<E> {\n  private Iterator<Bar> innerIterator;\n\n  public FooIterator(Collection<Bar> bars) {\n    innerIterator = bars.iterator();\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public boolean hasNext() {\n    return innerIterator.hasNext();\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public E next() {\n    Bar bar = innerIterator.next();\n    try {\n      Constructor<E> constructor = (Constructor<E>) bar.getClass().getConstructor(Bar.class);\n      return constructor.newInstance(bar);\n    } catch (NoSuchMethodException | IllegalAccessException | InstantiationException | InvocationTargetException e) {\n      throw new RuntimeException(\"E does not have an appropriate constructor\", e);\n    }\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public void remove() {\n    throw new UnsupportedOperationException(\"Don't remove from FooIterator!\");\n  }\n}\n \n<<<explanation>>>: In order to ensure that E has a constructor that takes a Bar, you can use a type parameter constraint by modifying the class declaration to `public class FooIterator<E extends Bar>`.
