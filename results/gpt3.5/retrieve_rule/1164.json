I am looking to sort the information out similar to how it is displayed in the output when I do a print statement to show results as shown below: QB 3 Anderson, Derek ACT TDS -- INT -- YDS -- RTG 0.0 CAR QB 2 Barkley, Matt ACT TDS 0 INT 4 YDS 300 RTG 44.6 PHI QB 5 Bethel-Thompson, McLeod ACT TDS 0 INT 0 YDS 0 RTG 0.0 SFIn my text file I have it shown as: QB3Anderson, DerekACTTDS--INT--YDS--RTG0.0CARQB2Barkley, MattACTTDS0INT4YDS300RTG44.6PHIQB5Bethel-Thompson, McLeodACTTDS0INT0YDS0RTG0.0SFAny Suggestions (Please note this is in Java)\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nimport java.io.BufferedReader;\nimport java.io.FileReader;\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.Collections;\nimport java.util.Comparator;\nimport java.util.List;\nimport java.util.StringTokenizer;\n\npublic class SortTXTFile {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        List<String> lines = readTXTFile(\"input.txt\");\n        List<Player> players = extractPlayers(lines);\n        sortPlayers(players);\n        printPlayers(players);\n    }\n    \n    private static List<String> readTXTFile(String fileName) {\n        List<String> lines = new ArrayList<>();\n        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(fileName))) {\n            String line;\n            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n                lines.add(line);\n            }\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n        return lines;\n    }\n    \n    private static List<Player> extractPlayers(List<String> lines) {\n        List<Player> players = new ArrayList<>();\n        for (String line : lines) {\n            StringTokenizer tokenizer = new StringTokenizer(line, \" \");\n            String position = tokenizer.nextToken();\n            String number = tokenizer.nextToken();\n            String name = tokenizer.nextToken(\",\");\n            String status = tokenizer.nextToken();\n            int touchdowns = Integer.parseInt(tokenizer.nextToken());\n            int interceptions = Integer.parseInt(tokenizer.nextToken());\n            int yards = Integer.parseInt(tokenizer.nextToken());\n            double rating = Double.parseDouble(tokenizer.nextToken());\n            String team = tokenizer.nextToken();\n            players.add(new Player(position, number, name, status, touchdowns, interceptions, yards, rating, team));\n        }\n        return players;\n    }\n    \n    private static void sortPlayers(List<Player> players) {\n        Collections.sort(players, new Comparator<Player>() {\n            @Override\n            public int compare(Player p1, Player p2) {\n                return p1.getName().compareTo(p2.getName());\n            }\n        });\n    }\n    \n    private static void printPlayers(List<Player> players) {\n        for (Player player : players) {\n            System.out.println(player);\n        }\n    }\n    \n    private static class Player {\n        private String position;\n        private String number;\n        private String name;\n        private String status;\n        private int touchdowns;\n        private int interceptions;\n        private int yards;\n        private double rating;\n        private String team;\n        \n        public Player(String position, String number, String name, String status, int touchdowns, int interceptions, int yards, double rating, String team) {\n            this.position = position;\n            this.number = number;\n            this.name = name;\n            this.status = status;\n            this.touchdowns = touchdowns;\n            this.interceptions = interceptions;\n            this.yards = yards;\n            this.rating = rating;\n            this.team = team;\n        }\n        \n        public String getName() {\n            return name;\n        }\n        \n        @Override\n        public String toString() {\n            return position + number + name + status + \"TDS\" + touchdowns + \"INT\" + interceptions + \"YDS\" + yards + \"RTG\" + rating + team;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: \n1.
