I use PrintWriter, BufferedWriter and FileWriter as shown belowpublic void writeToFile(String FileName){    PrintWriter pw = null;    try {        pw = new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(FileName)));        for(Cars car : list){            pw.println(car.getType());            pw.println(car.getMaxSpeed());            pw.println(car.getOwner());            pw.println();            pw.flush();        }        pw.close();    }    catch(IOException ex){        System.err.println(ex);    }}Now how can I read this data from file? I tried to use InputStreamReader, BufferedReader and FileInputStream, but my NetBeans shows me an error message    public void readFromFile() throws IOException {        InputStreamReader fr = null;        try {            fr = new InputStreamReader(new BufferedReader(new FileInputStream(new FileReader(\"c:\\\\cars.txt\"))));            System.out.println(fr.read());        } catch (Exception ex) {            System.out.println(ex.getMessage());        } finally {            fr.close();        }    }  What is wrong with this method?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: \nTo read the data from the file, you can use the BufferedReader and FileReader classes along with the StringTokenizer.nextToken method.
