Improve this question                    From our application we fetch images (jpeg/png) from a third party service, after download we want to save these images as compressed.Can any one please guide how to compress images in Java ?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nimport java.util.Iterator;\n\npublic class ImageCompression {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Assume you have fetched the images and stored them in a list\n        List<Image> images = fetchImagesFromThirdPartyService();\n        \n        // Create an iterator for the list of images\n        Iterator<Image> iterator = images.iterator();\n        \n        // Iterate through the images and compress each one\n        while (iterator.hasNext()) {\n            Image image = iterator.next();\n            compressImage(image);\n        }\n    }\n    \n    private static List<Image> fetchImagesFromThirdPartyService() {\n        // Code to fetch images from third party service and return a list\n    }\n    \n    private static void compressImage(Image image) {\n        // Code to compress the image\n    }\n}\n```\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nTo compress images in Java using the Iterator.next API, you can follow these steps:\n1.
