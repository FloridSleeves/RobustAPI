I know the structure from some documentation and would like to use that stream as an ObjectInputStream, but before I can call any self made readObject methods, this approach fails, due to java.io.StreamCorruptedException: invalid stream header. What's the best way to populate java objects from such a byte stream?BTW: Data is coming in as LittleEndian, texts as 16bit chars preceeded by 4 byte size info, e.g.   03 00 00 00 41 00 62 00 63 00   (hex)would result in \"Abc\"\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\ntry {\n    FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(\"file.bin\");\n    byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\n    int bytesRead;\n    while ((bytesRead = fis.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n        // Process the data in the buffer\n    }\n    fis.close();\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: To access data from a foreign stream, you can use the InputStream.read method.
