Every line has only one unique word:catdoggod...I want to use Lucene to search for every anagram in dictionary of specific word. For example:I want to search every anagram of the word dog and lucene should search my dictionary and return dog and god. In my webapp I have a Word Entity:public class Word {    private Long id;    private String word;    private String baseLetters;    private String definition;}and baseLetters is the variable which are sorted letters alphabetically for searching such anagrams [god and dog words will have the same baseLetters: dgo]. I succeeded in searching such anagrams from my database using this baseLetters variable in different service but I have problem to create index of my dictionary file. I know I have to add to fields:word and baseLetters but I have no idea how to do it :( Could someone show me some directions to achieve this goal?For now I have only something like that:public class DictionaryIndexer {private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(DictionaryIndexer.class);@Value(\"${dictionary.path}\")private String dictionaryPath;@Value(\"${lucene.search.indexDir}\")private String indexPath;public void createIndex() throws CorruptIndexException, LockObtainFailedException {    try {        IndexWriter indexWriter = getLuceneIndexer();        createDocument();               } catch (IOException e) {        logger.error(e.getMessage(), e);    }        }private IndexWriter getLuceneIndexer() throws CorruptIndexException, LockObtainFailedException, IOException {    StandardAnalyzer analyzer = new StandardAnalyzer(Version.LUCENE_36);    IndexWriterConfig indexWriterConfig = new IndexWriterConfig(Version.LUCENE_36, analyzer);    indexWriterConfig.setOpenMode(OpenMode.CREATE_OR_APPEND);    Directory directory = new SimpleFSDirectory(new File(indexPath));    return new IndexWriter(directory, indexWriterConfig);}private void createDocument() throws FileNotFoundException {    File sjp = new File(dictionaryPath);    Reader reader = new FileReader(sjp);    Document dictionary = new Document();    dictionary.add(new Field(\"word\", reader));}}PS: One more question. If i register DocumentIndexer as a bean in Spring will the index be creating/appending every time I redeploy my webapp? and the same will be with the future DictionarySearcher?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nprivate void createDocument() throws FileNotFoundException, IOException {\n    File sjp = new File(dictionaryPath);\n    BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(sjp));\n    String line;\n    while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {\n        Document dictionary = new Document();\n        dictionary.add(new Field(\"word\", line, Field.Store.YES, Field.Index.ANALYZED));\n        // Add baseLetters field here\n        indexWriter.addDocument(dictionary);\n    }\n    reader.close();\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: \nTo add the \"word\" field to the Lucene document, you can use the `BufferedReader.readLine` API to read each line from the dictionary file. Then, create a new `Document` object and add a new `Field` with the line as the value. The `Field.Store.YES` parameter specifies that the field should be stored in the index, and the `Field.Index.ANALYZED` parameter specifies that the field should be tokenized and indexed for searching.\n\nTo add the \"baseLetters\" field, you can modify the code inside the while loop to calculate the sorted letters alphabetically for each word and add it as a new field in the document.\n\nRegarding your second question, if you register the `DocumentIndexer` as a bean in Spring, the index will be created/appended every time you redeploy your webapp. This is because the `createIndex` method is called during the initialization of the bean.
