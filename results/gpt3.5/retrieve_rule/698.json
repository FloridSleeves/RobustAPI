However, when I try to initialize a new PrintWriter it throws a FileNotFound exception.Here are two versions of my code that both don't work, writer is initialized in the global variable as a PrintWriter.File file = new File(fileName);writer = new PrintWriter(fileName);writer.println(\"N: \" + N);writer.println(\"E: \" + E);writer.println(\"D: \" + D);writer.flush();writer.close();~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~writer = new PrintWriter(fileName);writer.println(\"N: \" + N);writer.println(\"E: \" + E);writer.println(\"D: \" + D);writer.flush();writer.close();Here is a list of the imports I'm using, am I possibly missing one?import java.text.DateFormat;import java.text.SimpleDateFormat;import java.math.*;import java.math.BigInteger;import java.util.*;import java.io.*;\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: \ntry {\n    PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(fileName);\n    writer.write(\"N: \" + N);\n    writer.write(\"E: \" + E);\n    writer.write(\"D: \" + D);\n    writer.flush();\n    writer.close();\n} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {\n    // Handle the FileNotFoundException here\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: In this code, we are using the PrintWriter.write method to write data to a file.
