But for some reason this keeps lagging out my game and running it out of memory. Why is this happening and how do I fix this?I create the list like this:List<Snake> snake = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<Snake>();This is where I create new objects and remove them in a forloop:public void snake() {    snake.add(new Snake(ball.getX(), ball.getY()));    currentTime++;    for(Snake currentSnake: snake) {        if(currentSnake.creationDate < SnakeLength){            currentSnake.Update();        } else {            Gdx.app.log(\"SnakeLength\" + SnakeLength, \"CreationDate\" + currentSnake.creationDate);            snake.remove(currentSnake);        }    }}This is how my snake class looks like:public class Snake{    float width = Gdx.graphics.getWidth();    float height = Gdx.graphics.getHeight();    float screenwidth = width/270;    float screenheight = height/480;    public float x;    public float y;    public int creationDate;    ShapeRenderer shapeRenderer;    SpriteBatch batch;    public boolean active = false;    public Snake(float x, float y) {        shapeRenderer = new ShapeRenderer();        batch = new SpriteBatch();        this.x = x;        this.y = y;    }    public void Update() {        batch.begin();        shapeRenderer.begin(ShapeType.Filled);        shapeRenderer.setColor(new Color(1, 1, 1, 0.2f));        shapeRenderer.circle(x + 8*screenwidth, y + 8*screenheight, 6*screenheight);        shapeRenderer.end();        batch.end();        creationDate++;    }}\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next()\n<<<code>>>: The code provided does not use the Iterator.next() method.\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The issue with the code is not related to the Iterator.next() method. The problem is that the code is continuously adding new Snake objects to the \"snake\" list without removing any. This causes the list to grow indefinitely and eventually leads to an \"Out of Memory\" error.\n\nTo fix this issue, you need to remove the Snake objects from the list once they reach a certain condition. In the provided code, the condition for removal is when the \"creationDate\" of a Snake object exceeds the \"SnakeLength\". However, removing elements from a list while iterating over it can cause a ConcurrentModificationException.\n\nTo avoid this exception, you can use an Iterator to iterate over the list and remove elements safely. Here's an updated version of the \"snake()\" method that uses an Iterator:\n\npublic void snake() {\n    snake.add(new Snake(ball.getX(), ball.getY()));\n    currentTime++;\n    \n    Iterator<Snake> iterator = snake.iterator();\n    while (iterator.hasNext()) {\n        Snake currentSnake = iterator.next();\n        \n        if (currentSnake.creationDate < SnakeLength) {\n            currentSnake.Update();\n        } else {\n            Gdx.app.log(\"SnakeLength\" + SnakeLength, \"CreationDate\" + currentSnake.creationDate);\n            iterator.remove();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nBy using the Iterator's remove() method, you can safely remove elements from the list while iterating over it. This should prevent the \"Out of Memory\" issue caused by continuously adding new Snake objects without removing any.", "gpt_response": {"id": "chatcmpl-8WgcWBg7AUmfGSLZ9oNpV71uBlosO", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1702801020, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next()\n<<<code>>>: The code provided does not use the Iterator.next() method.\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The issue with the code is not related to the Iterator.next() method.
