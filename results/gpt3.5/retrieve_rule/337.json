I am moving this web app on azure. In on premises web app there is one functionality in which I upload the image first in a temporary folder in C: and later access that file for application. The location of uploaded file is also stored in DB for further references. I have defined the base-path for uploading file in a properties file and accessing through it in controller as well as service layer for creating the directory, file name and file path.Can any tell me how to do the same in azure using azure storage? Any help is appreciated.Code in properties file:# Base File Path for Uploading Files fileupload.basepath=C:/webAppCode for creating temporary folder    @RequestMapping(value = \"/file/upload\", method = RequestMethod.POST)public @ResponseBodyString upload(MultipartHttpServletRequest request,        HttpServletResponse response) {    // 0. notice, we have used MultipartHttpServletRequest    // 1. get the files from the request object    Iterator<String> itr = request.getFileNames();    MultipartFile mpf = request.getFile(itr.next());    if (!CommonUtil.isNull(mpf)) {        if (mpf.getSize() > ProductCommonConstants.MAX_FILE_UPLOAD_SIZE_IN_BYTES) {            return CommonConstants.STR_FAILURE;        }    }    long fileName = Calendar.getInstance().getTimeInMillis();    final String modelImageDirPath = baseUploadFilePath + \"/\"            + CommonConstants.TEMP_FILE_NAME;    // Check for folder existence    final File modelImageDir = new File(modelImageDirPath);    if (!modelImageDir.exists()) {        // Create the directory        modelImageDir.mkdirs();    }    InputStream is = null;    FileOutputStream fos = null;    try {        String contentType = mpf.getContentType();        if (contentType != null) {            is = new DataInputStream(mpf.getInputStream());            // just temporary save file info            File file = new File(modelImageDirPath + \"/\" + fileName);            fos = new FileOutputStream(file);            // Write to the file            IOUtils.copy(is, fos);        }    } catch (FileNotFoundException ex) {    } catch (IOException ex) {    } finally {        try {            if (fos != null) {                fos.close();            }            if (is != null) {                is.close();            }        } catch (IOException ignored) {            // Log the Exception        }    }    // 2. send it back to the client as <img> that calls get method    // we are using getTimeInMillis to avoid server cached image    return \"/service/common/file/get/\" + fileName;}}\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next()\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nIterator<String> itr = request.getFileNames();\nMultipartFile mpf = request.getFile(itr.next());\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: \nIn the given code, the `Iterator.next()` method is used to get the next element from the `Iterator` object `itr`.
