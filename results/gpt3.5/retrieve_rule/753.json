I managed to do the below, which works, but it has raised some questions/fundamental gaps in my knowledge. I  believe that based on the principles of good O.O. programming practice, I should break the below down into a series of methods that have a single purpose, and then call those methods. However, I really struggle doing this. Can anyone please elaborate/advise a way to improve on that specific point? Or correct me if I'm wrong? public class Main{    private static ArrayList<String> dictionary;     private static ArrayList<String> tempdictionary;    public static void main() throws FileNotFoundException    {        Scanner inFile = new Scanner(new FileReader(\"H:\\\\csc8001\\\\results.txt\"));        dictionary = new ArrayList <>();        tempdictionary = new ArrayList <>();        while (inFile.hasNext()) {             dictionary.add(inFile.next().toLowerCase().replaceAll(\"[^a-zA-Z ]\", \"\"));        }        inFile.close();        PrintWriter outFile = new PrintWriter(\"H:\\\\csc8001\\\\results1.txt\");        int index = 0;        for (String a : dictionary)        {            if (!tempdictionary.contains(a)){                 tempdictionary.add(a);            } else {                index++;            }        }        Collections.sort(tempdictionary);        for (int i=0; i<tempdictionary.size(); i++)            outFile.println(tempdictionary.get(i));        outFile.flush();        outFile.close();    }}\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>:\npublic class Main{\n    private static ArrayList<String> dictionary;\n    private static ArrayList<String> tempdictionary;\n    \n    public static void main() throws FileNotFoundException {\n        readFromFile();\n        createDictionary();\n        outputToFile();\n    }\n    \n    private static void readFromFile() throws FileNotFoundException {\n        Scanner inFile = new Scanner(new FileReader(\"H:\\\\csc8001\\\\results.txt\"));\n        dictionary = new ArrayList<>();\n        while (inFile.hasNext()) {\n            dictionary.add(inFile.next().toLowerCase().replaceAll(\"[^a-zA-Z ]\", \"\"));\n        }\n        inFile.close();\n    }\n    \n    private static void createDictionary() {\n        tempdictionary = new ArrayList<>();\n        for (String word : dictionary) {\n            if (!tempdictionary.contains(word)) {\n                tempdictionary.add(word);\n            }\n        }\n        Collections.sort(tempdictionary);\n    }\n    \n    private static void outputToFile() throws FileNotFoundException {\n        PrintWriter outFile = new PrintWriter(\"H:\\\\csc8001\\\\results1.txt\");\n        for (String word : tempdictionary) {\n            outFile.write(word + \"\\n\");\n        }\n        outFile.close();\n    }\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>:\nIn the given code, the main method is responsible for executing the entire program.
