Also is it better to just read up the input stream into an array or string and then create input streams for each use ?EDIT 2:Sorry to reopen the question, but the conditions are somewhat different when working inside desktop and web application. First of all, the InputStream i get from the org.apache.commons.fileupload.FileItem in my tomcat web app doesn't support markings thus cannot reset. Second, I'd like to be able to keep the file in memory for faster acces and less io problems when dealing with files.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: To cache an InputStream for multiple use, you can read the data from the original InputStream into a byte array and create new InputStreams from the byte array whenever needed.\n\nHere is an example code snippet:\n\n```java\n// Read data from the original InputStream into a byte array\nByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\nint bytesRead;\nwhile ((bytesRead = inputStream.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n    baos.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);\n}\nbyte[] data = baos.toByteArray();\n\n// Create new InputStreams from the byte array whenever needed\nInputStream cachedInputStream1 = new ByteArrayInputStream(data);\nInputStream cachedInputStream2 = new ByteArrayInputStream(data);\n```\n\n<<<explanation>>>: This code reads the data from the original InputStream into a byte array using a buffer.
