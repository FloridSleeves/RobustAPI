I.e if i dont support dont transmit...c). i could have annotaded injection i.e@Twitter, @Facebook all in a controller bean and then select the appropriate but my service implementations number will grow....Thanks in advance,Dimitri\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next()\n<<<code>>>: The code provided does not use the Iterator.next() API, so there is no specific code to provide for this question.\n<<<explanation>>>: The Iterator.next() API is not relevant to the question about injecting a list of service objects in CDI (Weld) and selecting the appropriate implementation based on certain rules contained within a message.
