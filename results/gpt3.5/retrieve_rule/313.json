The only way to know that the flagged elements are over, is by noticing that the (k+1)th element is not flagged. The problem is that if I do that, the iterator it will not provide me the first value anymore on the next call to next().I want to pass this iterator to a method as it's only argument and I would like to avoid changing its signarture and it implementation. I know I could do this:    public void methodAcceptingIterator(Iterator<String> it) //current signature   //change it to   public void methodAcceptingIterator(String firstElement, Iterator<String> it)But this looks like a workarround/hack decreasing the elegance and generality of the code, so I don't want to this. Any ideas how I could solve this problem ?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: \nString firstElement = it.next();\nwhile (it.hasNext()) {\n    String element = it.next();\n    if (!element.startsWith(\"*\")) {\n        break;\n    }\n}\nit = new Iterator<String>() {\n    boolean isFirstElement = true;\n    \n    @Override\n    public boolean hasNext() {\n        return isFirstElement || it.hasNext();\n    }\n    \n    @Override\n    public String next() {\n        if (isFirstElement) {\n            isFirstElement = false;\n            return firstElement;\n        }\n        return it.next();\n    }\n};\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nTo solve this problem, you can retrieve the first element from the iterator before iterating over the flagged elements.
