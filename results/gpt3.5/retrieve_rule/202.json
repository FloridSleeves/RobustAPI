For this i want to port a code snipped from C into Java:static uint16 getchecksum(uint8 *rom, int length){  int i;  uint16 checksum = 0;  for (i = 0; i < length; i += 2)  {    checksum += ((rom[i] << 8) + rom[i + 1]);  }  return checksum;}I understand what the code does. It sums all 16bit numbers (combined from two 8 bit ones). But what i didn't understand is what's happening with the overflow of the uint16 and how this transfers to Java code?Edit:This code seems to work, thanks:int calculatedChecksum = 0;int bufferi1=0;int bufferi2=0;bs = new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(this.file));bufferi1 = bs.read();bufferi2 = bs.read();while(bufferi1 != -1 && bufferi2 != -1){    calculatedChecksum += (bufferi1*256 + bufferi2);    calculatedChecksum = calculatedChecksum % 0x10000;    bufferi1 = bs.read();    bufferi2 = bs.read();}\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: \nint calculatedChecksum = 0;\nint bufferi1=0;\nint bufferi2=0;\nbs = new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(this.file));\nbufferi1 = bs.read();\nbufferi2 = bs.read();\nwhile(bufferi1 != -1 && bufferi2 != -1){\n    calculatedChecksum += (bufferi1*256 + bufferi2);\n    calculatedChecksum = calculatedChecksum % 0x10000;\n    bufferi1 = bs.read();\n    bufferi2 = bs.read();\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nThe code snippet provided reads data from an InputStream in Java and calculates the checksum of a Sega Genesis rom file. \n\nThe code initializes variables `calculatedChecksum`, `bufferi1`, and `bufferi2` to 0.
