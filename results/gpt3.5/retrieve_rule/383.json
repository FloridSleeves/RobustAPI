How to refer to the current item?: :I have a class which holds a linked list of Item objects. I want this class to hold the \"current\" Item somehow so I can refer to it in other parts of the program. Is the best way to do this to create a Item object within my class and set it equal to the \"current\" Item when I wish to set it?as such:for(int i = 0; i < [LinkedListofItems].length(); i++)    {Item currentItem = [LinkedListofItems].getAt(i); break;}And then if I would like to set and Items attributes equal to anothers I would override the = operator?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next()\n<<<code>>>: \nIterator<Item> iterator = linkedList.iterator();\nItem currentItem = iterator.next();\n<<<explanation>>>: To refer to the current item in a linked list, you can use an iterator. First, create an iterator object by calling the iterator() method on your linked list. Then, use the next() method on the iterator to get the next element in the list. This will set the \"current\" item to the next item in the list. You can repeat this process to iterate through the entire list. Note that the iterator will throw a NoSuchElementException if there are no more elements in the list, so make sure to handle this exception if necessary.", "gpt_response": {"id": "chatcmpl-8WgNxHiUVLaCeZ5Jv6EkhIBc9MNP1", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1702800117, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next()\n<<<code>>>: \nIterator<Item> iterator = linkedList.iterator();\nItem currentItem = iterator.next();\n<<<explanation>>>: To refer to the current item in a linked list, you can use an iterator.
