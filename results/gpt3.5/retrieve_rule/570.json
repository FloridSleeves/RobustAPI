The compiler complains about the super token in <B super A> because you can't have lower-bounded type variables! Now how would I write this method in Java code without having to time-travel back to when generics didn't exist in the Java world?Yes, I know that you think I could use B extends A, but that is not the same thing, as shown by my implementation:public <R extends E> R reduceLeft(BiFunction<? super R, ? super E, ? extends R> mapper){    if (this.isEmpty())    {        return null;    }    Iterator<E> iterator = this.iterator();    R first = iterator.next(); // doesn't work, but would if R was a super-type of E (R super E)    while (iterator.hasNext())    {        mapper.apply(first, iterator.next());    }    return first;}Instead, I had to use this slightly more restricted version:public E reduceLeft(BiFunction<? super E, ? super E, ? extends E> mapper){    if (this.isEmpty())    {        return null;    }    Iterator<E> iterator = this.iterator();    E first = iterator.next();    while (iterator.hasNext())    {        first = mapper.apply(first, iterator.next());    }    return first;}\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: E next()\n<<<explanation>>>: The `next()` method is used to retrieve the next element from an Iterator.
