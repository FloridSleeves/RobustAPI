The problem is that Cipher.update() doesn't return the encrypted block until it has a full 16-byte block because CTR is basically based on a block cipher though simulating a stream cipher. I should read data from a tcp socket and process messages as soon as they arrive, but I can't retrieve the most recent block because it's still building up and its size is less than 16 bytes. And I can't just wait because we don't know when the next message would be sent. Of course I could call Cipher.doFinal() to get the leftover but that would mean the end of the stream (connection) and the Cipher object would be reinitialized.I thought it would be nice if there's a way to peek the carryover. CTR simply XORs the plain text with the keystream so I should be able to get the encrypted data regardless of the rest of the bytes in the block. Would there be a nice workaround to this problem? I'm thinking about writing a wrapper that encrypts fake plain text with zeroes to get the keystream in advance and XORs manually, but I wonder how other people solved this problem.UpdateI'm developing an Android application and it turned out that this is the problem of the Dalvik VM. As Robert and monnand pointed out below, Java SE doesn't have this problem at least with the default provider. I think I'll have to write a wrapper class or change the mode to CFB8 to get around this problem. (CTR8 didn't work) Thanks for all the responses!\nPlease using this api: Cipher.init.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Cipher.init\n<<<code>>>: \nTo simulate a stream cipher with AES/CTR, you can use the Cipher.init method to initialize the Cipher object with the AES/CTR transformation and the key. You can then use the Cipher.update method to encrypt the data as it arrives, without waiting for a full 16-byte block.\n\nHere's an example code snippet:\n\n```\nCipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CTR/NoPadding\");\nSecretKeySpec keySpec = new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, \"AES\");\nIvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(ivBytes);\n\ncipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, keySpec, ivSpec);\n\nbyte[] encryptedData = cipher.update(data);\n```\n\nIn this code, `keyBytes` is the key used for encryption, `ivBytes` is the initialization vector, and `data` is the data to be encrypted. The `Cipher.update` method is called with the data as it arrives, and it returns the encrypted data.\n\nNote that you need to provide the key and initialization vector that are compatible with AES/CTR. The key should be 16 bytes long for AES128, and the initialization vector should be 16 bytes long as well.\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nThe Cipher.init method is used to initialize a Cipher object with a specified algorithm and key.
