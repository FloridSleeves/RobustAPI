I have tried with runtime.exec and with processBuilder.pb: String cmd = \"ffmpeg -i input.vob output.mp4\" Runtime rt = Runtime.getRuntime();Process proc = rt.exec(cmd); proc.waitFor();This works fine with small input file (say less than 10 Mb). If I give larger input file then program will be hanged. Output file will be partially created and file creation will be hanged and control will not return. Even proc.join(10000); did not give any useful result. Here parent process is terminating before child process (ffmpeg) gets completed.How to overcome this problem?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: \nString cmd = \"ffmpeg -i input.vob output.mp4\";\nRuntime rt = Runtime.getRuntime();\nProcess proc = rt.exec(cmd);\nInputStream inputStream = proc.getInputStream();\nint data;\nwhile ((data = inputStream.read()) != -1) {\n    // process the data\n}\nproc.waitFor();\n\n<<<explanation>>>: In order to make the parent process wait until the child process (ffmpeg) gets completed, you can use the InputStream.read API to read the output of the child process.
