I actually wanna write a binary file. In MATLAB I am simply calling:fwrite(filename, A, precision)How could I achieve the same in JAVA?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: \npublic void writeWNDFile(){\n    String strFilePath = \"C:/Users/fperrone/Desktop/ddd.txt\";\n    try {\n        PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(strFilePath);\n        writer.write(\"12\");\n        writer.close();\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        System.out.println(\"IOException : \" + e);\n    }\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: In the given code, the issue is that you are using a DataOutputStream to write the double value, which writes the binary representation of the double value. To write the value as a string, you can use the PrintWriter.write method.
