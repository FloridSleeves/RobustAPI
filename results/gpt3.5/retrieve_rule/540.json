Because you can't have two methods with the same signature (Our compiler thinks Integer sum(Iterable<Integer>) has the same signature as Double sum(Iterable<Double>).) I tried to write one method with generics.private static <T extends Number> T sum(Iterable<? extends T> it) {    T result;    for(T next : it) {        result += next;    }    return result;}However this method will not compile (reason: the operator += is undefined for Object, Object). What can I do here? I know in C++ you can overload operators, but not in Java. But every class which extends Number does overload the += operator. What can I do here?Thank you in advance.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: \nprivate static <T extends Number> T sum(Iterable<? extends T> it) {\n    T result = null;\n    for(T next : it) {\n        result = (T) add(result, next);\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\nprivate static <T extends Number> Number add(T a, T b) {\n    if (a instanceof Integer) {\n        return (Integer) a + (Integer) b;\n    } else if (a instanceof Double) {\n        return (Double) a + (Double) b;\n    } else if (a instanceof Long) {\n        return (Long) a + (Long) b;\n    } else {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Unsupported number type\");\n    }\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: In Java, you cannot directly overload operators like in C++.
