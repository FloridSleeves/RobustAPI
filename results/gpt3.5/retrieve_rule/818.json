It gives a different score every time, which I need to save to a String (or file, but I guess a string would be easier, because I need it to be empty at every new call for the database).I want to store all the scores by going through the loop, and then adding a , after each score (to keep them seperate) but my code isn't working because a part of the code is outside the for loop. How do I fix this? Or are there better/other methods to do what I want to create?DatabaseHandler db = new DatabaseHandler(camera.this);List<Database> contacts = db.getAllContacts();for (Database contact : contacts) {    String test = contact.getMP();    StringWriter stringWriter = new StringWriter();    PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(stringWriter);    printWriter.println(test);}  printWriter.flush();printWriter.close();return stringWriter.toString();\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: \nDatabaseHandler db = new DatabaseHandler(camera.this);\nList<Database> contacts = db.getAllContacts();\nStringWriter stringWriter = new StringWriter();\nPrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(stringWriter);\n\nfor (Database contact : contacts) {\n    String test = contact.getMP();\n    printWriter.write(test);\n    printWriter.write(\",\");\n}\n\nprintWriter.flush();\nprintWriter.close();\nreturn stringWriter.toString();\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nIn the given code, we can use the PrintWriter.write method to write the scores to a StringWriter.
