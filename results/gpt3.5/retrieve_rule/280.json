Is there a method in Java 8 Stream that I can use to achieve this?Thanks.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next()\n<<<code>>>: \nIntStream from(int n) {\n    return IntStream.iterate(n, m -> m + 1);\n}\n\nIntStream sieve(IntStream s) {\n    Iterator<Integer> iterator = s.iterator();\n    int head = iterator.next();\n    return IntStream.concat(IntStream.of(head), sieve(IntStream.generate(iterator::next).filter(n -> n % head != 0)));\n}\n\nIntStream primes = sieve(from(2));\nprimes.limit(1000).forEach(System.out::println);\n\n<<<explanation>>>: In order to achieve the equivalent of Scala's Stream.head and Stream.tail in Java 8, you can use the Iterator.next() method. By converting the IntStream to an Iterator using the iterator() method, you can call next() to get the first element of the stream. Then, you can use IntStream.generate() to create a new stream from the iterator's next() method, which will give you the rest of the elements.
