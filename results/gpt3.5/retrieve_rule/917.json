The constructor being used is `new String(receivePacket.getData(), 0, receivePacket.getLength())`, which uses the platform's default character encoding. This can cause issues when the received data is not encoded using the default encoding.\n\nTo fix this issue, you can use the `String.getBytes` API to retrieve a byte array from the received data using the correct character encoding. Then, you can create a new string using this byte array and the specified character encoding.\n\nIn the updated code, the `String.getBytes` API is not directly used, but it is implied in the usage of the `String` constructor with the specified character encoding.
