The background app should then open a connection using a socket to a server and then send some dummy data. After having done so, the service should die.I'm currently getting a java.lang.IllegalStateException when I click the button and the whole application stops.Here is what I have so far in my main activity.public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {  @Override  protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);  }  public void start_clicked(View view) {    Intent my_intent = new Intent(this,BackgroundService.class);    startActivity(my_intent);  }}Here is the XML corresponding to the button and to the background service:This is Activity_Main.xml<Button    android:layout_width=\"wrap_content\"    android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"    android:text=\"Start\"    android:id=\"@+id/button\"    android:layout_centerVertical=\"true\"    android:layout_centerHorizontal=\"true\"    android:onClick=\"start_clicked\"/>This is the Android Manifest corresponding to the service<service android:name=\"com.example.g.backgroundsensor.BackgroundService\"        android:exported=\"true\"        android:enabled=\"true\" ></service>And finally here is the actual BackgroundService class (fragments which I think caused the error)public class BackgroundService extends Service {private Socket my_socket;public BackgroundService() {    try {        my_socket = new Socket(ip, 5000);    }catch(Exception e){    }}public int onStartCommand(Intent intent, int flags, int startId) {    try {        DataOutputStream my_stream = new DataOutputStream(my_socket.getOutputStream());        my_stream.write(121);    }catch(Exception e){    }    stopSelf();    return 1;}What is causing this error and how could I (in the future) debug this myself since the console is relatively vague:---/com.example.g.backgroundsensor E/AndroidRuntime: FATAL EXCEPTION: main---/com.example.g.backgroundsensor E/AndroidRuntime: Process: com.example.g.backgroundsensor, PID: 9876---/com.example.g.backgroundsensor E/AndroidRuntime: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Could not execute method of the activity\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: DataOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>: The error is caused by the fact that you are trying to start a service using startActivity() method instead of startService() method.
