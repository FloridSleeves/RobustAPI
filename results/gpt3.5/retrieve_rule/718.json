However flushing the underlying OutputStream has a big performance hit.Does a PrintWriter / PrintStream need to be flushed.If I need to flush the PrintStream / PrintWriter; can I do so without flushing the underlying OutputStream, or will I need to create a \"flush protecter\" OutputStream to wrap the underlying stream?To try to be a little clearer on this I want to implement public void writeSomeString(OutputStream foo);But this method may be called many times for the same OutputStream (foo).  Each call will have to construct its own PrintWriter.  I know it's ugly to do so but I have no control over the interface or the creation of foo.I'm trying to avoid each method having to flush foo just to flush its own PrintWriter / PrintStream.So I want to:public void writeSomeString(OutputStream foo) {    PrintStream s = new PrintStream(foo);    s.println(\"bar\");    // other code}I want to completely avoid this method flushing foo \nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: \n\npublic void writeSomeString(OutputStream foo) {\n    PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(foo);\n    writer.println(\"bar\");\n    writer.flush();\n    writer.close();\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nIn order to ensure that the data written by the PrintWriter is actually sent to the underlying OutputStream, you need to call the flush() method.
