I have a programming project due and I need help figuring out how to read through a text file (using a scanner) that contains multiple words and integers on a single line. The text file is a list of state names and their respective Average Family Incomes over a 3 year span. I need to get those values and calculate the average over the three years and display it all back in a nice table.My problem is that I can get the average of the first few lines because they only have one word and three values. Using scanner.next() gets me past the first few lines, but there are multiple lines that contain 2 or more words and then the three values.Currently, I get an InputMismatchException after the scanner reaches \"District of Colombia\" and it won't get the next value since scanner.next() only gets me to the word \"of\". Is there any way around this? Here is the first part of the project that just outputs all of the data (without an average):Part 1 (works)public class FamilyIncomeByState {          public void familyIncomeFile() throws IOException {                 File income = new File (\"src\\\\hw2p2\\\\FamilyIncome.txt\");                    Scanner scanner = new Scanner (income);                 String year = scanner.nextLine();                   System.out.println(year);           System.out.println(\"--------------------------------------------\");        while (scanner.hasNextLine()){            String line = scanner.nextLine();                           System.out.println(line);            System.out.println(\" \");        }                   scanner.close();    }       }Part 2 (doesn't work) EDIT: Put in the wrong code the first time, this is the correct code. public class AverageFamilyIncomeByState {           public void familyAverageIncomeFile() throws IOException {        File income = new File (\"src\\\\hw2p2\\\\FamilyIncome.txt\");        Scanner scanner = new Scanner (income);        String year = scanner.nextLine();        System.out.println(year + \"     Average\");        System.out.println(\"-------------------------------------------------------\");                  while(scanner.hasNextLine()) {            String words = scanner.next();              double num1 = scanner.nextDouble();            double num2 = scanner.nextDouble();            double num3 = scanner.nextDouble();            double averageD = (num1 + num2 + num3) / 3;            BigDecimal average = BigDecimal.valueOf(averageD);            System.out.println(words + \"    \" + average);            System.out.println(\" \");            scanner.nextLine();                     }        scanner.close();    }}And here is the content of the text file: State           2002    2003    2004Alabama         53754   54594   51451Alaska          69868   71395   66874Arizuna         56857   56067   55663Arkansas        49551   47838   44537California      65766   63761   63206Colorado        68089   67634   66624Connecticut     81891   82517   82702Delaware        69469   73301   69360District of Columbia    55692   61799   63406Florida         57473   56824   55351Georgia         60676   59497   59489Hawaii          67564   66014   65872Idaho           54279   51098   53722Illinois        69168   66507   68117Indiana         63022   63573   62079Iowa            61238   61656   57921Kanses          61926   61686   56784Kentucky        54030   54319   51249Louisiana       52299   51234   47363Maine           58802   58425   56186Maryland        77938   82879   77562Massachusetts       78312   80247   78025Michigan        67995   68337   68740Minnesota       72379   72635   70553Mississippi     47847   46810   46331Missouri        59764   61036   61173Montana         51791   48078   46142Nebraska        60129   60626   57040Nevada          59588   59283   59614New Hampshire       72369   72606   71661New Jersey      82406   80577   78560New Mexico      48422   46596   47314New York        65461   66498   64520North Carolina      58227   56500   57203North Dakta     57070   55138   53140Ohio            63934   64282   62251Oklahoma        51377   53949   48459Oregon          60262   58737   58315Pennsylvania        64310   66130   65411Rhode Island        67646   70446   68418South Carolina      56110   59212   56294South Dakota        55359   59718   55150Tennessee       55605   56052   54899Texas           56278   56606   53513Utah            59864   59035   57043Vermont         62331   62938   59125Virginia        66889   69616   68054Warshington     66531   65997   63568West Virginia       47550   49470   46270Wisconsin       66988   65441   66725Wyoming         57148   58541   55859And here is my main method:    package hw2p2;import java.io.IOException;public class Launcher {    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {        FamilyIncomeByState familyIncomeByState = new FamilyIncomeByState();        familyIncomeByState.familyIncomeFile();        AverageFamilyIncomeByState familyAverageIncomeByState = new AverageFamilyIncomeByState();        familyAverageIncomeByState.familyAverageIncomeFile();    }}The part I'm stuck on should have an output that lists the Average values as a Fifth Column, but it just won't cycle past the 2nd word in a state name.
