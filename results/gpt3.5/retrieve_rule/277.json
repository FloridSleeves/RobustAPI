The next() function will return iterator.next().next()I have implemented below code, it doesn't look elegant at all.And for list {1, 9, 8, 7, 8, 2, 5}, it will only output 9, 7, 2.Any clue to do it in a better way?Basically this jump iterator is trying to iterator each element with one distance, for example, for 1,2,3,4,5, it will return 1,3,5public class JumpIterator implements Iterator<Integer> {    private Iterator<Integer> it;    public JumpIterator(List<Integer> list){        it = list.iterator();    }    @Override    public boolean hasNext() {        if(!it.hasNext()){            return false;        }else{            it.next();            return it.hasNext();        }    }    @Override    public Integer next() {        return it.next();    }}\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: \npublic class JumpIterator implements Iterator<Integer> {\n    private Iterator<Integer> it;\n    private boolean hasJumped;\n\n    public JumpIterator(List<Integer> list){\n        it = list.iterator();\n        hasJumped = false;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public boolean hasNext() {\n        if(hasJumped){\n            return it.hasNext();\n        }else{\n            return it.hasNext() && it.next() != null;\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public Integer next() {\n        if(hasJumped){\n            hasJumped = false;\n            return it.next();\n        }else{\n            hasJumped = true;\n            if(it.hasNext()){\n                it.next();\n            }\n            return it.next();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nIn the updated code, we introduced a new boolean variable called hasJumped to keep track of whether we have already jumped to the next element or not.
