{"api": "RandomAccessFile.read", "prompt": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nFor API RandomAccessFile.read, the API usage rule is: Try to read data into a byte array from a `RandomAccessFile`, and ensure that the read operation succeeds (returns true).

The code is as followsRandomAccessFile in = new RandomAccessFile('BOT.GRD', \"r\");in.read(a);Now I want to choose file dynamically rather than providing directly as above. I tried a lot and I was unable to do that.
