First, create a FileInputStream for the specified file and manage any exceptions that may occur. Then, define the block size as 17 bits. Since the read method reads bytes, you need to create a byte array with a size of blockSize / 8 to store the read data. Use the read method to read the data into the buffer array. If the bytesRead is -1, it means the end of the file has been reached. Otherwise, process the read data by converting the bytes to bits. Iterate over each byte in the buffer and for each bit in the byte, append it to a StringBuilder. After converting the bytes to bits, you can get the first 17 bits by using the substring method. Finally, you can apply the CRC algorithm to the first 17 bits.
