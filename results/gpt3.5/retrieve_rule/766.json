I've been searching on the net on how to accomplish this over the last couple of days but I wasn't able to come to a solution.Can someone advise me on what code to use to accomplish my task?Thanks so much!public class ReadFile1 {public static void main(String[] a)throws IOException{showDir(1, new File(\"/Users/User/Documents/1 eclipse test/testfolder1\"));//File file = new File(\"/Users/User/Documents/1 eclipse test/testfolder1/puppy4.txt\");//long fileSize = file.length();}static void showDir(int indent, File file) throws IOException { for (int i = 0; i < indent; i++)      System.out.print('-');System.out.println(file.getName() + \" - \" + file.length() / 1024 + \" KB\");  if (file.isDirectory()) {  File[] files = file.listFiles();  for (int i = 0; i < files.length; i++)    showDir(indent + 4, files[i]);     }}}\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nimport java.io.*;\n\npublic class ReadFile1 {\n    public static void main(String[] a) throws IOException {\n        PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"output.txt\");\n        showDir(1, new File(\"/Users/User/Documents/1 eclipse test/testfolder1\"), writer);\n        writer.close();\n    }\n\n    static void showDir(int indent, File file, PrintWriter writer) throws IOException {\n        for (int i = 0; i < indent; i++)\n            writer.write('-');\n        writer.write(file.getName() + \" - \" + file.length() / 1024 + \" KB\\n\");\n        if (file.isDirectory()) {\n            File[] files = file.listFiles();\n            for (int i = 0; i < files.length; i++)\n                showDir(indent + 4, files[i], writer);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: \nTo output the file lists to a text file, you can use the `PrintWriter.write` method to write the data to the file.
