{"api": "InputStream.read", "prompt": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nFor API InputStream.read, the API usage rule is: Create a FileInputStream for a specified file and manage any exceptions that may occur.\nRead data from an InputStream, and manage any exceptions that may occur.\n\nQuestion: Reading and Handling Streams: :I want to read and handle a stream of String containing single OR multiple commands in one line.I am currently using InputStream in = socket.getInputStream(); for my inputstream.Also for handling the input a typical Thread:public void run() {    String input = \"\";    try {        int data = 0;        while (!isInterrupted()) {            while ((data = in.read()) != -1 && !isInterrupted()) {                input += Integer.toHexString(data);                handleInput(input);            }            try {                sleep(500);            } catch (InterruptedException e) {                break;            }        }        socket.close();        return;    } catch (IOException e) {        main.log(\"Connection lost...\");        main.log(e.toString());        main.stopBTCommunication();        main.startBTServer();    }}handleInput() is designed to handle any String given to it and response correctly. The problem with this implementation would be, that handleInput() is called with every byte read from in.read(). I know, that i could use BufferedReader.readLine(), but that would require every incomming command to have \"\\n\" appended to it, which is NOT the case and can't be changed. I know that         while (!isInterrupted()) {            while ((data = in.read()) != -1 && !isInterrupted()) { is kind of nuisance, but basically it want the Thread to read until nothing new is read, then handle that input and then read again...EDIT:So basically, what i need is a non-blocking read().EDIT2:How can incoming commands and commandchains look like:Select Command: \"s\"ReadLine Command: \"rlXX\" whereby X is a Hex DigitWriteLine Command: \"wlXXSSSSSSSS\" whereby X and S are Hex DigitsSo a commandschain may look like one of the following:\"s\"\"srlff\" = \"s\" + \"rlff\"\"rlffwlbb2e2e2e2erlbb\" = \"s\" + \"rlff\" + \"wlbb2e2e2e2e\" + \"rlbb\"\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\npublic void run() {\n    String input = \"\";\n    try {\n        int data = 0;\n        while (!isInterrupted()) {\n            while (in.available() > 0 && !isInterrupted()) {\n                data = in.read();\n                input += Integer.toHexString(data);\n            }\n            handleInput(input);\n            input = \"\";\n            try {\n                sleep(500);\n            } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        socket.close();\n        return;\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        main.log(\"Connection lost...\");\n        main.log(e.toString());\n        main.stopBTCommunication();\n        main.startBTServer();\n    }\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: \nIn the given code, the `InputStream.read()` method is used to read data from the input stream.
