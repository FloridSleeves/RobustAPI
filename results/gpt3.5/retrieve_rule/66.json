When I try to write to file byte[] (eg. of length 173517) using the function Files.write write into file random bytes (eg. 3355) each time, I get a different value. This is my code:byte[] dataBytes = Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get(file.getAbsolutePath()));byte[] cipByte = cipher.doFinal(dataBytes);byte[] encr = Base64.getEncoder().encode(cipByte);Files.write(Paths.get(encryptedFile.getAbsolutePath()), encr); //encr len = 173517\nPlease using this api: Cipher.init.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Cipher.init\n<<<code>>>: \n```\nCipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(transformation);\ncipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);\nbyte[] encryptedBytes = cipher.doFinal(dataBytes);\nFiles.write(Paths.get(encryptedFile.getAbsolutePath()), encryptedBytes);\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: \nTo fix the issue with your code, you need to initialize the Cipher object properly before performing the encryption. The Cipher.init method is used to initialize the Cipher object with the specified algorithm and key.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to use Cipher.init correctly:\n\n1. Create an instance of the Cipher object using the Cipher.getInstance method, passing the desired transformation as the argument.\n2. Initialize the Cipher object using the Cipher.init method, passing Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE as the first argument and the encryption key as the second argument.\n3. Perform the encryption using the Cipher.doFinal method, passing the dataBytes array as the argument. This will return the encrypted bytes.\n4.
