Closed 10 years ago.I want to write byte array to a file as bytes. e.g. byt[] =\"hello\".getBytes();I want to write the byt to a file , such that I see the contents as bytes, not as \"hello\".How can I do that?\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: String.getBytes()\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nString str = \"hello\";\nbyte[] bytes = str.getBytes();\nFileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(\"output.txt\");\nfos.write(bytes);\nfos.close();\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: \nTo write a byte array as bytes to a file, you can use the `FileOutputStream` class in Java.
