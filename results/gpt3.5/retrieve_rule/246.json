This portion needs to get images from flickr and load them into a texture.  The code I have below is functional most of the time, but it has a Thread.sleep() kludge in between getting the input stream from the connection and the bitmap factory decoding the stream:            URL url = new URL(\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4132/5168797476_7a85deb2be_b.jpg\");            URLConnection con = url.openConnection();            InputStream is = con.getInputStream();            Thread.sleep(250); //What am I actually waiting for?            sourceBitmap = BitmapFactory.decodeStream(is);How do I get around using the sleep() method in favor of something that makes logical sense?I am testing on a samsung galaxy tab not in the emulator\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: \nURL url = new URL(\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4132/5168797476_7a85deb2be_b.jpg\");\nURLConnection con = url.openConnection();\nInputStream is = con.getInputStream();\nByteArrayOutputStream outputStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[4096];\nint bytesRead;\nwhile ((bytesRead = is.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n    outputStream.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);\n}\nbyte[] imageBytes = outputStream.toByteArray();\nsourceBitmap = BitmapFactory.decodeByteArray(imageBytes, 0, imageBytes.length);\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nInstead of using Thread.sleep(), you can use the InputStream.read method to read the image data from the InputStream into a byte array.
