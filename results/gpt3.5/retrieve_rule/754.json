It works like a charm. I want my output to be put into a new file called VectorDump instead of it just being displayed on the regular screen. Where would I start this in my program here?

Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n1. Import the necessary classes: `import java.io.*;`\n2. Create a PrintWriter object and pass it a FileWriter object with the file name \"VectorDump.txt\" in the constructor: `PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(\"VectorDump.txt\"));`\n3. Inside the loop where you check for prime numbers, instead of printing the numbers to the console, use the PrintWriter.write method to write the numbers to the file: `writer.print(n + \" \");` or `writer.println(n);`\n4. After the loop, close the PrintWriter object to ensure that all the data is written to the file: `writer.close();`\n5.
