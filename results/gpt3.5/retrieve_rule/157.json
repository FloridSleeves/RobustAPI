Then, you can use the skip() method to skip the desired number of bytes from the beginning of the file. After that, you can create a custom LimitedInputStream class that extends InputStream and takes the FileInputStream and the desired number of bytes as parameters. This custom class should override the read() method to read from the FileInputStream and keep track of the number of bytes read. Once the desired number of bytes is reached, the read() method should return -1 to indicate the end of the stream.
