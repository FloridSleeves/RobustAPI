I found out some platforms don't recognize these generated vCards unless their lines are separated by Carriage Returns (CR), and JSP seems to use just Line Feed (LF) by default to separate lines.Do you guys know any way to tell the JSP to include a CR between each line?I hope someone has a clue, cause I haven't found much out there...Thanks in advance!\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(response.getWriter());\nout.write(\"Line 1\\r\\n\");\nout.write(\"Line 2\\r\\n\");\nout.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: To make a JSP print carriage returns (CR), you can use the PrintWriter.write method to write each line with a carriage return and line feed (\"\\r\\n\") at the end.
