I'd like to take advantage of this feature.Here's the scenario.File FOO.BAR is 20 MB.  I'd split it into some arbitrary chunk size, let's say 1 MB, which means 20 chunks.   Chunks #3 and #14 fail (maybe the cellular/WiFi connection was bad).  I can now re-upload just these two chunks and everything will be good.What I'd like to know is how can I read only part of a file (like the data between 3MB and 4MB)?  The file piece should be an InputStream or File object.Thanks,Makoto\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: RandomAccessFile.read\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\ntry {\n    RandomAccessFile file = new RandomAccessFile(\"path/to/file\", \"r\");\n    file.seek(startPosition); // set the starting position\n    byte[] buffer = new byte[length]; // create a byte array to store the read data\n    int bytesRead = file.read(buffer); // read data into the buffer\n    if (bytesRead != -1) {\n        // process the read data\n    }\n    file.close(); // close the file\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    // handle the exception\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: \nTo read a segment of a file using `RandomAccessFile.read`, you need to follow these steps:\n1.
