In Java, strings are stored as arrays of characters, where each character is represented by 2 bytes (UTF-16 encoding). When you call String.getBytes() with a specified character encoding, it converts the string into a byte array using that encoding.\n\nIn the given code, we first load the XML file contents as a String.

Finally, we measure the size of the byte array, which represents the memory size of the string object in Java.\n\nThe reason why the resulting string object in memory is much closer to the 2kB in C++ is because C++ does not have the same internal representation for strings as Java. In C++, strings are typically represented as arrays of characters, where each character is represented by 1 byte. Therefore, when you take the length of the serialized object (e.g., string) in C++, it directly reflects the size of the string in memory.\n\nIt's important to note that the memory size measured using Instrumentation in Java may not be an exact representation of the actual memory usage, as it may include additional overhead.
