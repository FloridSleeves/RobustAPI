I have no idea what I am doing wrong. Right now I have nested for loops comparing an int to the rest in the ArrayList. except how I either setup or increment I am skipping the duplicate next to where I start the first for loop over again. I have found it useful to reset my i=0 after I remove my index j. It still won't remove the duplicate if they are right next to each other.for(int i=0;i<original.size();i++){    for(int j=i+1;j<original.size();j++){        if(original.get(i)==original.get(j)){            original.remove(j);           }    }}EDIT: I found my solution, when I changed my second for loop to a while loop, then incremented each time, but when I found a duplicate I removed 1 from j. That way I would be starting over.Thank you all. \nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next()\n<<<code>>>: \nIterator<Integer> iterator = original.iterator();\nint current = iterator.next();\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\n    int next = iterator.next();\n    if (current == next) {\n        iterator.remove();\n    } else {\n        current = next;\n    }\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: \nTo remove duplicates in an ArrayList without using a HashSet, you can use the Iterator.next() method.
