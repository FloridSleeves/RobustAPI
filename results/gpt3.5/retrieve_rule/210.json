Is there any other way I can do this with FileReader? I know that there is the BOMInputStream that should work, but I'd rather find a solution using FileReader.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nprivate final String UTF8_BOM = \"\\uFEFF\";\nprivate String removeUTF8BOM(String s) {\n    if (s.startsWith(UTF8_BOM)) {\n        s = s.substring(1);\n    }\n    return s;\n}\n\nInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream(\"file.txt\");\nBufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(inputStream, \"UTF-8\"));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {\n    line = removeUTF8BOM(line);\n    // write line to separate file\n}\nreader.close();\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: \nTo remove the BOM character from a UTF-8 encoded file using the InputStream.read API, you can use the following steps:\n1.
