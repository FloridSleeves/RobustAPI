{"api": "InputStream.read", "prompt": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nFor API InputStream.read, the API usage rule is: Create a FileInputStream for a specified file and manage any exceptions that may occur.\nRead data from an InputStream, and manage any exceptions that may occur.\n\nQuestion: Any byte >= 128 is received as 65533: :I am implementing a server on Android and I am using:while (!Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) {    try {        int r;        String response = \"\";        while ((r = input.read()) > 0) {        ...        }    ...}I have two issues. If the client sends me a byte of value 0, it is not received by the server. The second issue is, if the byte value is 128 or more, I keep receiving a value of 65533 or a binary value of 11111101. Anyone knows how to solve these issues. I am a beginner in networking on JAVA.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: To solve the first issue, you can modify the while loop condition to check for -1 instead of 0. This will ensure that the loop continues until the end of the stream is reached.\n\nTo solve the second issue, you can use the InputStream.read(byte[] b) method instead of the InputStream.read() method. This method reads up to b.length bytes of data from the input stream into an array of bytes. This will allow you to receive bytes with values >= 128 correctly.\n\nHere's an example of how you can modify your code to address both issues:\n\nwhile (!Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) {\n    try {\n        byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\n        int bytesRead;\n        String response = \"\";\n        while ((bytesRead = input.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n            // Process the received bytes\n            for (int i = 0; i < bytesRead; i++) {\n                // Access each byte in the buffer\n                byte receivedByte = buffer[i];\n                // Process the received byte\n                // ...\n            }\n        }\n        // ...\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        // Handle any exceptions that may occur\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: By using the InputStream.read(byte[] b) method, you can read bytes from the input stream into a byte array.
