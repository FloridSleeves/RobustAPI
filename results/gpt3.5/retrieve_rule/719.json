I am working with NetBeans and tomcat as the server for testing. I have the GameSettings.html which the user choose the board size and press submit.  The data is being sent to servlet named: GameSettingsServlet.java  There I pull out the boardSize and parse it to an integer:  @Overrideprotected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)        throws ServletException, IOException {   createEngine(request);   processRequest(request, response);}private void createEngine(HttpServletRequest request){    int boardSize = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter(\"boardSize\"));    int numberOfPlayers = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter(\"numberOfPlayers\"));    m_Engine = new Engine(boardSize, numberOfPlayers );}I want to create the board with javaScript so I need to send the boardSize parameter to the   javaScript (which should run on BoardGame.html)  in order to know how much rows and columns to create.How can I pass the boardSize to the javaScript or HTML ?I searched on the web but I found only about JSP and I need it on HTML.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: In the GameSettingsServlet.java, after creating the Engine object, you can use PrintWriter to write the boardSize parameter to the response. Here's an example:\n\nprotected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {\n   createEngine(request);\n   response.setContentType(\"text/html\");\n   PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();\n   out.write(\"<script>var boardSize = \" + boardSize + \";</script>\");\n   out.close();\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: In this code, we first create the Engine object using the boardSize parameter. Then, we set the content type of the response to \"text/html\" and get the PrintWriter object from the response. We use the PrintWriter's write method to write a JavaScript variable assignment to the response. The boardSize value is embedded in the JavaScript code as a variable. Finally, we close the PrintWriter. This way, the boardSize value will be available in the JavaScript code on the BoardGame.html page.", "gpt_response": {"id": "chatcmpl-8Wh2Ei6cwEwOioIc3Gv9rGGzsvQYd", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1702802614, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: In the GameSettingsServlet.java, after creating the Engine object, you can use PrintWriter to write the boardSize parameter to the response.
