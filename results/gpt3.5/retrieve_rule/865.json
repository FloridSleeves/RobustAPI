Unfortunately, cryptography is not my strong side. Now I can write to file several messages and then close file. Then i can open it, append some messages, close again and after decryption I see padding bytes in the middle of file. Is there any way to work with encrypted file without having to decrypt it every time I want to append some messages?EDIT: little more details. Current implementation utlizes CipherOutputStream. As i understand there's no way to seek using it.Can i use 'NoPadding' option if i will control that output data size is divisible by block size?\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: RandomAccessFile.write(byte[] b, int off, int len)\n<<<code>>>: \n```\nRandomAccessFile file = new RandomAccessFile(\"encrypted.log\", \"rw\");\nfile.seek(file.length());\nfile.write(data);\nfile.close();\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: To append data to an encrypted file without decrypting it, you can use the RandomAccessFile.write method. First, open the file in \"rw\" mode to allow both reading and writing. Then, use the `seek` method to move the file pointer to the end of the file. This ensures that the new data will be appended to the existing content. Finally, use the `write` method to write the data to the file, and close the file after writing.
