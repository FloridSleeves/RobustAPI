{"api": "Iterator.next", "prompt": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nFor API Iterator.next, the API usage rule is: Get the next element from an Iterator if it has more elements.\n\nQuestion: Is it possible to create in Java 8 a unlimitedly growing in lazy way collection, defined by recursion?: :I can create a recursive closure:static IntUnaryOperator fibo;fibo =     (i) ->     i<2 ? 1 : fibo.applyAsInt(i-1)+ fibo.applyAsInt(i-2);But of course, it has sense only as an example. To be useful, such collection should keep already once counted elements and get() them without recounting. The counting of elements should happen in lazy way, at first need. Thus, no member will have to be calculated more than once. In such way we'll a structure that will look like a recursively defined sequence, and will be fast and reusable. When I started to study Java 8 I thought that Stream works in that way. But it does not, for the stream cannot be used twice.I thought about the following construction:IntStream fi;fi=IntStream.iterate(0, i -> fi[i-1]+fi[i-2]);But that way it won't work - I can't get an item from the stream by index.The other problem is that if I'll later go along the stream, it will be consumed and I can't use it repeatedly. If I copy the stream to List, it is not lazy anymore.As a result, I need some construction that I can address by index. As fibo(i). Edit. Obviously, the solution cannot be a stream, for the stream cannot be used twice. I don't want to repeat all calculations on every call to F(i).\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: \npublic class LazyCollection implements Iterator<Integer> {\n    private int currentIndex = 0;\n    \n    @Override\n    public boolean hasNext() {\n        return true;\n    }\n    \n    @Override\n    public Integer next() {\n        int result = fibo(currentIndex);\n        currentIndex++;\n        return result;\n    }\n    \n    private int fibo(int n) {\n        if (n < 2) {\n            return 1;\n        }\n        int a = 1;\n        int b = 1;\n        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {\n            int temp = a + b;\n            a = b;\n            b = temp;\n        }\n        return b;\n    }\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nTo create a lazily growing collection in Java 8, you can implement the Iterator interface and override the hasNext() and next() methods.
