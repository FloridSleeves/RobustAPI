My goal is to append a chunk of HTML just before the closing </body> of all HTML responses.I'm working on a solution that extends the HttpServletResponseWrapper to use my own PrintWriter, then overriding the write methods thereon. Inside the write method I'm storing the last 7 characters to see if it's equal to the closing body tag, and then I write my HTML chunk plus the closing body tag, before continuing normal write operations for the rest of the document.I feel that somebody must have solved this problem already, and probably more elegantly than I will. I'd appreciate any examples of how to use a servlet filter to insert content into a response.UPDATEDResponding to a comment, I am also trying to implement the CharResponseWrapper from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/filters-137243.html. Here is my code:PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();CharResponseWrapper wrappedResponse = new CharResponseWrapper(        (HttpServletResponse)response);chain.doFilter(wrappedRequest, wrappedResponse);String s = wrappedResponse.toString();if (wrappedResponse.getContentType().equals(\"text/html\") &&        StringUtils.isNotBlank(s)) {    CharArrayWriter caw = new CharArrayWriter();    caw.write(s.substring(0, s.indexOf(\"</body>\") - 1));    caw.write(\"WTF</body></html>\");    response.setContentLength(caw.toString().length());    out.write(caw.toString());}else {    out.write(wrappedResponse.toString());}out.close();I am also wrapping the request, but that code works and shouldn't affect the response.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>:\nPrintWriter out = response.getWriter();\nCharResponseWrapper wrappedResponse = new CharResponseWrapper((HttpServletResponse)response);\nchain.doFilter(wrappedRequest, wrappedResponse);\nString s = wrappedResponse.toString();\nif (wrappedResponse.getContentType().equals(\"text/html\") && StringUtils.isNotBlank(s)) {\n    CharArrayWriter caw = new CharArrayWriter();\n    caw.write(s.substring(0, s.indexOf(\"</body>\") - 1));\n    caw.write(\"WTF</body></html>\");\n    response.setContentLength(caw.toString().length());\n    out.write(caw.toString());\n} else {\n    out.write(wrappedResponse.toString());\n}\nout.close();\n\n<<<explanation>>>:\nIn this code, the PrintWriter.write API is used to write data to the PrintWriter object named \"out\".
