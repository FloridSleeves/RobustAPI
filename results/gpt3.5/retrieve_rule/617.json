But I was wondering if there was a way of getting the above to work without splitting it up, and if it does need casting (which I'm sure it does) where to put it?EDITNot that it changes anything, but for those who'd like to know more, the answers that I have received do solve the problems. But the Hash Map I'm using is type Object, Object, though it is more used like String, Object, and it does contain data from a database. Unfortunately I can't change the Hash Map as it comes from a piece of purpose built framework that I cannot change.\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Map.get\n<<<code>>>: long total = ((Long) currentRowContents.get(\"value_A\")).longValue() + ((Long) currentRowContents.get(\"value_B\")).longValue();\n<<<explanation>>>: In order to add two values together that are stored as Longs in a HashMap, you can use the Map.get method to obtain the values based on the specified keys. Since the values are stored as Objects in the HashMap, you need to cast them to Long before using the .longValue() method to get the long representation of the values.
