It seems to be a compilation error related to the usage of the Set class in your code.\n<<<explanation>>>: The error message suggests that you are trying to parameterize a non-generic Set class with the argument <Integer>. In Java, the Set interface is generic, meaning it can be parameterized with a specific type. For example, you can create a Set of Integers using Set<Integer>. However, if you are getting this error, it means that you are trying to use a non-generic Set class that does not support parameterization.\n\nTo fix this error, you should check your code and make sure that you are using the correct Set class. It is possible that you imported the wrong Set class or that there is a typo in your code.
