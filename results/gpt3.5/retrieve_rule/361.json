I have to use iterators and the compareTo() method. For example...Example:   L1: A,B,C,D    L2: B,D,F,G      result: A,B,B,C,D,D,F,GI can assume the input lists are already sorted and i cant use the contains() method. I have some initial checks but the while loop is what im stuck on.public static ListADT<String> merge(ListADT<String> L1,ListADT<String> L2) throws BadListException {ListADT<String> L3 = new ArrayList<String>;if(L1 == null || L2 == null) {    throw new BadListException();}Iterator<String> itr1 = new L1.iterator();Iterator<String> itr2 = new L2.iterator();  if(L1.size() == 0 && L2.size() == 0) {    return L3;}if(L1.size() == 0 && L2.size() != 0) {    for(int i = 0; i < L2.size(); i++) {        return L3.add(L2.get(i));    }}if(L2.size() == 0 && L1.size() != 0) {    for(int i = 0; i < L1.size(); i++) {        return L3.add(L1.get(i));    }}while(itr1.hasNext() || irt2.hasNext()) {    //merge the lists here?}}Any help would be appreciated.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next()\n<<<code>>>: \nwhile(itr1.hasNext() && itr2.hasNext()) {\n    String str1 = itr1.next();\n    String str2 = itr2.next();\n    int compareResult = str1.compareTo(str2);\n    if(compareResult < 0) {\n        L3.add(str1);\n        itr2.previous();\n    } else if(compareResult > 0) {\n        L3.add(str2);\n        itr1.previous();\n    } else {\n        L3.add(str1);\n        L3.add(str2);\n    }\n}\n\nwhile(itr1.hasNext()) {\n    L3.add(itr1.next());\n}\n\nwhile(itr2.hasNext()) {\n    L3.add(itr2.next());\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nTo merge two lists using iterators and the compareTo() method, you can use the Iterator.next() method to iterate through the elements of both lists. \n\nFirst, you need to check if both iterators have more elements using itr1.hasNext() and itr2.hasNext(). If both iterators have more elements, you can retrieve the next element from each iterator using itr1.next() and itr2.next().\n\nThen, you can compare the two strings using the compareTo() method. If the result is less than 0, it means that the string from L1 should come before the string from L2 in the merged list.

In this case, you can add the string from L2 to L3 and move the iterator itr1 back one position using itr1.previous().\n\nIf the result is 0, it means that the strings from L1 and L2 are equal. In this case, you can add both strings to L3.\n\nAfter merging the elements from both lists, you need to check if there are any remaining elements in either list.
