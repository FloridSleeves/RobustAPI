However, often i find writing partial mocks time consuming, and it does not feel 'right'.I'd say its a design fault as my class I try to mock has multiple concerns into one, therefore I should create seperate classes in order to seperate concerns.What do you think? Is partially mocking a good or bad thing? And, if good/bad, why? What would you suggest if you notice you cannot mock the object because you only want to mock a few methods?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: Partial mocking can be a useful tool in certain situations, but it is generally considered a bad practice. It can lead to code that is difficult to understand, maintain, and test.\n\nWhen you find yourself needing to partially mock an object, it is often a sign that the object has multiple responsibilities and violates the Single Responsibility Principle. In this case, it would be better to refactor the class into separate classes, each with a single responsibility. This will make your code more modular, easier to understand, and easier to test.\n\nIf you find that you cannot mock the object because you only want to mock a few methods, it may be a sign that the object is tightly coupled to other parts of your code. In this case, you can consider using dependency injection to decouple the object from its dependencies. This will make it easier to mock the object and test your code.\n\nIn summary, while partial mocking can be a useful tool in some cases, it is generally a sign of design issues and should be avoided.
