{"api": "Iterator.next", "prompt": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nFor API Iterator.next, the API usage rule is: Get the next element from an Iterator if it has more elements.\n\nQuestion: Java: Using Iterator in Switch Statement: :I want to cycle through an ArrayList<String> named fileContent, using the Iterator interface, and I want it to be analyzed one string at a time which should result in a specific state by the switch statement, depending on what string it is. Object token is supposed to be read as 'Table'.        void process() {        Iterator fileIterator = fileContent.iterator();        int state = 0;        Object token = null;        switch (state) {        case 0:            token = fileIterator.next();            if (token.equals(\"Table\")) {                System.out.println(token);                state = 1;            } else {                System.err.println(\"Corrupt file format at state 0: \"+ token);                System.exit(0);            }            break;        }    }This doesn't switch state to 1, instead it prints out:'Corrupt file format at state 0: Table'So it seems as it reads the Object token correctly as 'Table' but not for the statement 'if (token.equals(\"Table\"))'. I have also tried 'if (token == (\"Table\"))'Can somebody help me?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next()\n<<<code>>>: \nvoid process() {\n    Iterator<String> fileIterator = fileContent.iterator();\n    int state = 0;\n    Object token = null;\n    switch (state) {\n        case 0:\n            if (fileIterator.hasNext()) {\n                token = fileIterator.next();\n                if (token.equals(\"Table\")) {\n                    System.out.println(token);\n                    state = 1;\n                } else {\n                    System.err.println(\"Corrupt file format at state 0: \" + token);\n                    System.exit(0);\n                }\n            }\n            break;\n    }\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: \nThe issue in your code is that you are not checking if the iterator has more elements before calling `fileIterator.next()`.
