Though the numbers are written in a text format. I want to accomplish this myself though i have stumbled upon a few difficulties that i would like some advice on.An example of the question is that one child has thirteen balloons and is selling them for three hundred cents. Obviously I have to set up the variables so the string numbers are converted into an integers e.g.int one = 1, two = 2, three = 3, twelve = 12, thirty = 30, hundred = 100;My initial attempt is to create a loop where I have assigned a count to stop when all the numbers have been accumulated, though the loop keeps on adding the the first number.My question is, when I input the text using the scanner object, what loop is required to add the first (written) number and then move onto the second (written) number, which will be added to the sum variable?Thanks for your time and I hope that this question is easy to understand.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>:\n```\nimport java.util.Scanner;\nimport java.util.StringTokenizer;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n        System.out.println(\"Enter a sentence with numbers written in text format:\");\n        String sentence = scanner.nextLine();\n        \n        StringTokenizer tokenizer = new StringTokenizer(sentence);\n        int sum = 0;\n        \n        while (tokenizer.hasMoreTokens()) {\n            String token = tokenizer.nextToken();\n            int number = convertTextToNumber(token);\n            sum += number;\n        }\n        \n        System.out.println(\"Sum of numbers: \" + sum);\n    }\n    \n    public static int convertTextToNumber(String text) {\n        // Implement your logic to convert text to number here\n        // You can use if-else statements or switch-case statements to handle different text representations of numbers\n        // For example, you can check if text is \"one\" and return 1, or if text is \"two\" and return 2, and so on\n        // If the text does not match any known number representation, you can return 0 or handle it as an error\n        return 0;\n    }\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: \n- The code uses the `Scanner` class to read a sentence from the user.\n- The sentence is then passed to a `StringTokenizer` object, which splits the sentence into individual words/tokens.\n- The code then enters a loop that iterates as long as there are more tokens available.\n- Inside the loop, each token is converted to a number using the `convertTextToNumber` method.
