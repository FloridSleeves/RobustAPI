Reason why I want to return iterator is to avoid defining setters and getters and removal methods. Does that break encapsulation?class Zoo{    private List<Animal> animalList;    public Zoo(){        animalList = new ArrayList<Animal>();    }    public void addAnimal(Animal animal){        animalList.add(animal);    }    public Iterator<Animal> iterator(){        return animalList.iterator();    }}class Animal{    private String name;    private double weight, height;    Animal(String name, double weight, double height){        this.name = name;        this.weight = weight;        this.height = height;    }}\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: Returning an iterator of a private List in a class is not considered bad practice. It is a common practice to provide access to the elements of a private List through an iterator. \n\n<<<explanation>>>: By returning an iterator, you are providing controlled access to the elements of the private List without exposing the underlying implementation details. This allows you to iterate over the elements of the List without directly modifying or accessing the List itself. It also allows you to avoid defining setters and getters for the List, which can simplify the code and improve encapsulation.\n\nIn the given code example, the Zoo class has a private List<Animal> animalList, and it provides access to the elements of this list through the iterator() method. This method returns an iterator for the animalList, which can be used to iterate over the elements of the list.\n\nBy returning an iterator instead of the List itself, you are encapsulating the implementation details of the animalList and providing a controlled way to access its elements.
