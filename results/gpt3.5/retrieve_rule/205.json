I create an CipherInputStream using an encrypting JCE cipher which I then use to create another CipherInputStream using a different decrypting JCE cipher.When I try to read then second stream all I get is empty data. I found no documentation forbidding the above behavior. Does anyone know what the problem is?This is the code which I am running, at the end plainText is empty (the same issue persists regardless of what SecurityProvider I use).InputStream payload = new ByteArrayInputStream(payloadArray);Cipher encryptCipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES\", \"SunJCE\");encryptCipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key, IV);InputStream encryptStream = new CipherInputStream(payload, encryptCipher);Cipher decryptCipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES\", \"SunJCE\");decryptCipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, key, IV);InputStream decryptStream = new CipherInputStream(encryptStream, decryptCipher);byte[] plainText = IOUtisl.toByteArray(decryptStream);Thanks!\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: \n```\nInputStream payload = new ByteArrayInputStream(payloadArray);\nCipher encryptCipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES\", \"SunJCE\");\nencryptCipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key, IV);\nInputStream encryptStream = new CipherInputStream(payload, encryptCipher);\nCipher decryptCipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES\", \"SunJCE\");\ndecryptCipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, key, IV);\nInputStream decryptStream = new CipherInputStream(encryptStream, decryptCipher);\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\nint bytesRead;\nByteArrayOutputStream outputStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();\nwhile ((bytesRead = decryptStream.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n    outputStream.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);\n}\nbyte[] plainText = outputStream.toByteArray();\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: \nThe issue you are facing is because you are trying to directly convert the `decryptStream` to a byte array using `IOUtils.toByteArray()`.
