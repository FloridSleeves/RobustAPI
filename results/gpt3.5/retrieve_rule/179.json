Im familiar with basic TCP sockets but want to know how to translate requirements into code.Example: Format for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Common Log Format (CLF)Would like to see how to translate: 0          7 8        15 16       23 24         31  +-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+  |  Version  |           Record Length           | 0 - 3  +-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+   Version (1 byte):  0x41 for this document; hexadecimal encoded.
