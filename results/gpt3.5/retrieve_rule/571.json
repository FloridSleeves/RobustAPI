Apache's CircularFifoQueue seems close but no cigar, as I don't want anything popped off the queue, I just want it to cycle over the same list time and time again as it is called.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: \n```\nIterator<Widget> iterator = widgets.iterator();\nWidget pickWidget() {\n    if (!iterator.hasNext()) {\n        iterator = widgets.iterator();\n    }\n    return iterator.next();\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: \nYou can use the `Iterator` interface to achieve the desired behavior. First, obtain an iterator from the `List<Widget>` using the `iterator()` method. Then, in the `pickWidget()` method, check if the iterator has a next element using the `hasNext()` method. If it does not have a next element, reset the iterator by obtaining a new iterator from the `List<Widget>`. Finally, return the next element using the `next()` method of the iterator.
