(1 answer)                            Closed last year.I'm trying to create a simple program that will output a string to a text file. Using code I found here, I have put together the following code: import java.io.*;public class Testing {  public static void main(String[] args) {    File file = new File (\"file.txt\");    file.getParentFile().mkdirs();    PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(file);    printWriter.println (\"hello\");    printWriter.close();         }} J-grasp throws me the following error:  ----jGRASP exec: javac -g Testing.javaTesting.java:10: error: unreported exception FileNotFoundException; must be caught or declared to be thrown    PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(file);                              ^1 error ----jGRASP wedge2: exit code for process is 1.Since I'm pretty new to Java, I have no idea what this means. Can anybody point me in the right direction? \nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: \nimport java.io.*;\n\npublic class Testing {\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n    try {\n      File file = new File(\"file.txt\");\n      file.getParentFile().mkdirs();\n      PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(file);\n      printWriter.write(\"hello\");\n      printWriter.close();\n    } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {\n      e.printStackTrace();\n    }\n  }\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: \nIn the given code, the PrintWriter.write method is used to write the string \"hello\" to a text file.
