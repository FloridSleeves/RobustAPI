Below is part of the code (specifically the loop): // Read lines from the file until no more are left.  while (inputFile.hasNext())  {      // Read the next name.     String friendName = inputFile.nextLine();      // Need line to make all letters uppercase  }  System.out.print(\"Enter the saved file name: \");  String filename2 = keyboard.nextLine();When I run it now: I am able to open the first text file and a second txt file is created, but there is no letters in the new file. \nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>:\n// Read lines from the file until no more are left.\nwhile (inputFile.hasNext()) {\n    // Read the next name.\n    String friendName = inputFile.nextLine();\n    // Convert the name to uppercase.\n    String uppercaseName = friendName.toUpperCase();\n    // Write the uppercase name to the new file.\n    outputFile.write(uppercaseName);\n    // Write a new line character to separate each name.\n    outputFile.write(System.lineSeparator());\n}\n// Close the PrintWriter.\noutputFile.close();\n\n<<<explanation>>>: In the given code, you can use the PrintWriter.write method to write the uppercase names to the new file.
