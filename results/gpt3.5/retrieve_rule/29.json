However, my showColumnCounts() method refuses to work. It works just fine on the main thread. I use it during onCreate() just not here. I thought the onPostExecute ran on the UI thread?Here is my showColumnCounts() method if it is relevant. public void showColumnCounts() {    TextView totalView = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.totalColumn2);    TextView ignoredView = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.ignoredColumn2);    TextView rView = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.rColumn2);    Cursor c = myDB.getEmptyRColumn(\"\");    int count = c.getCount();    if (count == 0) {        c.close();        return;    }    String unread = String.valueOf(count);    String total = getTotalCount();    int tTotal = Integer.parseInt(total);    int r = tTotal - count;    String read = String.valueOf(r);    totalView.setText(total);    ignoredView.setText(unread);    rView.setText(read);    c.close();}I've been fiddling with it for a while now assuming the answer should be obvious but I'm calling uncle. Can't figure it.Edit***** 6/30I THINK I've found my problem. In my background thread I am using a parse.com method \"query.findInBackground\" which I assume is starting a third thread? I'm trying to update this to \"query.find\" and I'm hoping that will fix.\nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Activity.setContentView\n<<<code>>>: setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n<<<explanation>>>: In the `onCreate` method of an Activity, you can use the `setContentView` method to set the layout for the activity.
