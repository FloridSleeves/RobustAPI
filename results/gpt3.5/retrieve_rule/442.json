I want to set key as value if condition gets matched by using key/value pair from mapdouble percent = r.nextDouble()*100;if(percent > 1.0 && percent < 70.0(how can I use 70 from testMap instead of hardcoding)) {//what to put below in place of Previous    commands.get(commandWithMaxNegativeOffset).setDataCriteria(Use the Key of 70.0 i.e Previous);} else if(percent > 71 && percent < 100){    commands.get(commandWithMaxNegativeOffset).setDataCriteria(Use the Key of 30.0 i.e New);}\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next()\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nIterator<Double> iterator = testMap.values().iterator();\ndouble value1 = iterator.next();\ndouble value2 = iterator.next();\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: The `Iterator.next()` method is used to get the next element from an iterator.
