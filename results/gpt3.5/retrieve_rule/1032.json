These are the instructions:Write a class called SpecialToken that has a static method called thirdToken. Thismethod should return as a String, the third token of a String that you pass as a parameter. You may assume that spaces will serve as delimiters.This is what I have so far but honestly I am stumped at what the parameter should be and how to return the third token! I was thinking I could do something like nextToken() until the third.public class SpecialToken {    public static String thirdToken() {    }}\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: \npublic class SpecialToken {\n    public static String thirdToken(String input) {\n        StringTokenizer tokenizer = new StringTokenizer(input);\n        String token = \"\";\n        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\n            if (tokenizer.hasMoreTokens()) {\n                token = tokenizer.nextToken();\n            } else {\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        return token;\n    }\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nIn the code above, we define a class called SpecialToken with a static method called thirdToken that takes a String input as a parameter. Inside the method, we create a new StringTokenizer object with the input string as the argument. We then initialize a String variable called token to store the third token.\n\nWe use a for loop to iterate three times, checking if there are more tokens available using the hasMoreTokens() method. If there are more tokens, we assign the next token to the token variable using the nextToken() method. If there are no more tokens, we break out of the loop.\n\nFinally, we return the value of the token variable, which will be the third token of the input string.", "gpt_response": {"id": "chatcmpl-8Whdh5GIyW7i2Mf7eVyuSeOeRS7sG", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1702804937, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: \npublic class SpecialToken {\n    public static String thirdToken(String input) {\n        StringTokenizer tokenizer = new StringTokenizer(input);\n        String token = \"\";\n        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\n            if (tokenizer.hasMoreTokens()) {\n                token = tokenizer.nextToken();\n            } else {\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        return token;\n    }\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nIn the code above, we define a class called SpecialToken with a static method called thirdToken that takes a String input as a parameter.
