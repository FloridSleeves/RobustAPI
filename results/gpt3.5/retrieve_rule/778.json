This causes the file to be overwritten with each iteration, resulting in an empty file at the end.\n\nTo fix this, you should move the creation of the PrintWriter object outside the while loop. This way, the file will only be opened once and all the lines will be written to it.\n\nI have modified your code accordingly. Now, the PrintWriter object is created before the while loop, and each line is written to the file using the `writer.write(line)` method.
