I am defining the linked hash map as follows... LinkedHashMap<String, String> sections; sections = new LinkedHashMap();Then, I have collected lines of text from a pdf. If certain conditions are met, II split the text on a white space putting the numerical value \"#######\" as the key and the rest of the line as the value... if (tocStartFound == true && tocEndFound == false) {     if (line.matches(\"\\\\d{6}.+\")){     String lineSplit[] = line.split(\"\\\\s\",2);     sections.put(lineSplit[0], lineSplit[1]); }Now, when i ask if line.contains(nextSection) I am told an \"object cannot be converted to a charSequence.\"if (sectionStarted == true){    Set set = sections.entrySet();    Iterator iter = set.iterator();    boolean foundName = false;    Object nextSection;    while(iter.hasNext()){        Map.Entry me = (Map.Entry)iter.next();        if (foundName == true){            nextSection = me.getValue();            nextSection = nextSection.toString();            break;        }        if (sectionName == me.getValue()) {            foundName = true;        }}Pattern pa = Pattern.compile(\".+((?i)end of section).+\");Matcher ma = pa.matcher(line);if (ma.find() || line.contains(nextSection)){    System.out.println(\"End of Section\");    sectionStarted = false;}I guess I thought by defining the map with <string,string>, i was enduring that the data would be typed as strings.

To ensure that the value is treated as a `String`, you can explicitly cast it to `String` using `nextSection = (String) iter.next();`. However, it is recommended to use generics to specify the type of elements in the iterator. In this case, you can define your iterator as `Iterator<String> iter = sections.values().iterator();` to ensure that the values returned by the iterator are of type `String`. Then, you can use `iter.next()` to get the next element as a `String`.\n\nTo compare if a string value \"line\" contains the value of the LinkedHashMap \"sections\", you can use the `contains()` method of the `String` class. Here's an example:\n\n```\nif (sectionStarted) {\n    Iterator<String> iter = sections.values().iterator();\n    String nextSection = \"\";\n    while (iter.hasNext()) {\n        nextSection = iter.next();\n        break;\n    }\n    \n    Pattern pa = Pattern.compile(\".+((?i)end of section).+\");\n    Matcher ma = pa.matcher(line);\n    if (ma.find() || line.contains(nextSection)) {\n        System.out.println(\"End of Section\");\n        sectionStarted = false;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, we retrieve the first value from the `sections` LinkedHashMap using the iterator. Then, we check if the `line` contains the `nextSection` value using the `contains()` method. If it does, we print \"End of Section\" and set `sectionStarted` to false.", "gpt_response": {"id": "chatcmpl-8WgBJeFxQSch1ep7ok2VDoEMKTAut", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1702799333, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next()\n<<<code>>>: \n```\nIterator<String> iter = sections.values().iterator();\nString nextSection = \"\";\nwhile (iter.hasNext()) {\n    nextSection = iter.next();\n    break;\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: The issue you are facing is because the value returned by `Iterator.next()` is of type `Object`, not `String`.
