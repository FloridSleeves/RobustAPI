So i'm thinking this is probably what they have done (the data was encrypted by a PHP application)I'm trying to decrypt this text with javax.crypto.Cipher but i think i problably need more information on the specific encryption, but i dont really know what information to ask for, and think its likely the 'default options' will probably work. (Communication with the supplying party is difficult and slow).i'm currently Using the following code to get the private key:  InputStreamReader ir = new InputStreamReader(the_inputstream_for_the_private_key_record);   Security.addProvider(new BouncyCastleProvider());   pemr = new PEMReader(ir);   Object o = pemr.readObject();   keyPair kp = (KeyPair) o;   return kp.getPrivate();This seems to work as i get a instantiated PrivateKey object without errors the toString looks like:RSA Private CRT Key            modulus: c98faa50ba69<trimmed>    public exponent: 10001   private exponent: bb889fbe5cb2a6763f...<trimmed>             primeP: eb73e85dc636f5751b...<trimmed>             primeQ: db269bd603a2b81fc9...<trimmed>     primeExponentP: 85b9f111c190595cc8...<trimmed>     primeExponentQ: a66d59a75bb77530de...<trimmed>     crtCoefficient: 79415b078c4c229746...<trimmed>For each record i also have a entry like the following:{\"decryptedLength\":128389,\"symKeyLength\":32,\"symKey\":\"SImE8VnSZaAu1Ve...<trimmed (this is always 685 chars long) >...ayaJcnpSeOqAGM7q=\"}Basically this is where i'm a bit stuck.My guess would be that that 'symkey' value is encrypted with RSA which in turn when decrypted would yield the secretKey for the AES part, but if i try:Cipher rsaCipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"RSA\");rsaCipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, key);byte[] b = rsaCipher.doFinal('symkey'.getbytes());this gets me \"javax.crypto.IllegalBlockSizeException: Data must not be longer than 512 bytes\", which seems logical since this string is 685characters longI'm probably missing something very obvious here...Any suggestions are appreciated.\nPlease using this api: Cipher.init.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Cipher.init\n<<<code>>>: \nCipher rsaCipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"RSA\");\nrsaCipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, key);\nbyte[] b = rsaCipher.doFinal(Base64.getDecoder().decode(symKey));\n\n<<<explanation>>>: In order to decrypt the 'symKey' value, you need to use the RSA private key that you obtained.
