Now I'm using the .split() function to try separate the tweets from one another but it would seem that \\r\\n09/19/14 isn't an appropriate split string? Here is the code:String[] value = line.split(\"\\r\\n09/19/14\");PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"hello.txt\", \"UTF-8\");writer.println(value[0]);writer.close();The text file 'hello', when I open it is just the following string again, \"TweetJSONObject\\r\\n09/19/14TweetJSONObject\". Any ideas as to where I'm going wrong?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: \nString[] value = line.split(\"\\r\\n09/19/14\");\nPrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"hello.txt\", \"UTF-8\");\nwriter.write(value[0]);\nwriter.close();\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The issue with your code is that you are using PrintWriter.println instead of PrintWriter.write.
