The format has a Header comprised of a three-char description, a dummy byte, plus a byte indicating the number of files. Then each file has an entry consisting of a dummy byte, a twelve-char string describing the file name, a dummy byte, and an offset declared in a three-byte array. What would be the proper class for reading this kind of structure? I have tried RandomAccessFile but it does not allow to read arrays of data, e.g. I can only read three chars by calling readChar() three times, etc.Of course I can extend RandomAccessFile to do what I want but there's got to be a proper out-of-the-box class to do this kind of processing isn't it?This is my reader for the header in C#:protected override void ReadHeader(){    Header = new string(this.BinaryReader.ReadChars(3));    byte dummy = this.BinaryReader.ReadByte();    NFiles = this.BinaryReader.ReadByte();}\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: RandomAccessFile.read(byte[] b)\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nRandomAccessFile file = new RandomAccessFile(\"file.txt\", \"r\");\nbyte[] header = new byte[16];\nfile.read(header);\nString description = new String(header, 0, 3);\nbyte dummyByte = header[3];\nint numFiles = header[4];\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: In order to read the header of the resource archive file format, you can use the `RandomAccessFile.read(byte[] b)` method. This method reads up to `b.length` bytes of data from the file into the byte array `b`. In this case, you can create a byte array `header` with a length of 16 (3 chars for description, 1 byte for dummy, 1 byte for number of files, and 11 bytes for padding). Then, you can pass this byte array to the `read` method to read the header data from the file. After reading, you can convert the first 3 bytes of the `header` array to a string to get the description, and access the dummy byte and number of files using their respective indices in the `header` array.", "gpt_response": {"id": "chatcmpl-8WhHvhmqaIKIHkzaDl5vyVF8g7Akt", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1702803587, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "<<<api>>>: RandomAccessFile.read(byte[] b)\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nRandomAccessFile file = new RandomAccessFile(\"file.txt\", \"r\");\nbyte[] header = new byte[16];\nfile.read(header);\nString description = new String(header, 0, 3);\nbyte dummyByte = header[3];\nint numFiles = header[4];\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: In order to read the header of the resource archive file format, you can use the `RandomAccessFile.read(byte[] b)` method.
