It's worked great until we recently realized that some of the commands I send are getting cut off at 1955 characters. The way everything is set up is that I send the server 1 line commands and it sends back 1 line responses. I can't figure out a way to send longer commands via DataOutputStream through the TelnetClient. Am I doing this wrong or is this just a limitation of one of these objects?public void connect() {    try {        tc = new TelnetClient();        TerminalTypeOptionHandler ttopt = new TerminalTypeOptionHandler(\"VT100\", false, false, true, false);        EchoOptionHandler echoopt = new EchoOptionHandler(true, false, true, false);        SuppressGAOptionHandler gaopt = new SuppressGAOptionHandler(true, true, true, true);        try {            tc.addOptionHandler(ttopt);            tc.addOptionHandler(echoopt);            tc.addOptionHandler(gaopt);        } catch (InvalidTelnetOptionException e) {            ServerConsole.log(e.getMessage());        }        tc.connect(\"192.168.1.8\", 2010);        in = new DataInputStream(tc.getInputStream());        out = new DataOutputStream(tc.getOutputStream());        login();    } catch (IOException ex) {        ServerConsole.log(ex.getMessage());    }}//This is a watered down version of my write method just to show the basic idea of whats happeningpublic String write(String command) {    String finalCommand = command+\"\\n\";    byte[] comm = finalCommand.getBytes();    out.write(comm);    out.flush();    response = in.readLine();    response = in.readLine();    return response;}\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: DataOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>: \n\npublic void write(String command) {\n    try {\n        String finalCommand = command + \"\\n\";\n        byte[] comm = finalCommand.getBytes();\n        out.write(comm);\n        out.flush();\n        response = in.readLine();\n        response = in.readLine();\n    } catch (IOException ex) {\n        ServerConsole.log(ex.getMessage());\n    }\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The code provided is using the DataOutputStream.write method correctly to write the command to the output stream.
