Normally I cd to Desktop/GIT/ and use this maven command \"mvn integration-test -DskipTests -P interactive -e\".I am building a java program and I am trying to run that command line but so far I wasn't successful. So far, here is the code:public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException {// TODO Auto-generated method stub Process theProcess = null;try  {      theProcess = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(\"mvn integration-test -DskipTests -P interactive -e\");  } catch(IOException e)  {     System.err.println(\"Error on exec() method\");     e.printStackTrace();    }// read from the called program's standard output stream  try  {     inStream = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader( theProcess.getInputStream()));       System.out.println(inStream.readLine());  }  catch(IOException e)  {     System.err.println(\"Error on inStream.readLine()\");     e.printStackTrace();    }break;    }}in.close();}\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\npublic static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n    Process theProcess = null;\n    try {\n        theProcess = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(\"mvn integration-test -DskipTests -P interactive -e\");\n    } catch(IOException e) {\n        System.err.println(\"Error on exec() method\");\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    }\n    \n    // Read from the called program's standard output stream\n    try {\n        InputStream inStream = theProcess.getInputStream();\n        int data;\n        while ((data = inStream.read()) != -1) {\n            System.out.print((char) data);\n        }\n    } catch(IOException e) {\n        System.err.println(\"Error on inStream.read()\");\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    }\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: \nTo run a `mvn` command from a Java program, you can use the `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()` method to execute the command. In this case, you can pass the command `\"mvn integration-test -DskipTests -P interactive -e\"` as a parameter to `exec()`.\n\nTo read the output from the executed command, you can use the `getInputStream()` method of the `Process` object returned by `exec()`. This method returns an `InputStream` that you can read from.\n\nIn the code provided, the output from the command is read character by character using the `read()` method of the `InputStream`. The `read()` method returns an integer representing the next byte of data, or -1 if the end of the stream is reached. The integer value is then cast to a `char` and printed to the console.\n\nNote that you need to handle any `IOException` that may occur when executing the command or reading from the input stream.", "gpt_response": {"id": "chatcmpl-8Wg6d4I8RApDtkACoTYsfCRprHAB2", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1702799043, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\npublic static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n    Process theProcess = null;\n    try {\n        theProcess = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(\"mvn integration-test -DskipTests -P interactive -e\");\n    } catch(IOException e) {\n        System.err.println(\"Error on exec() method\");\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    }\n    \n    // Read from the called program's standard output stream\n    try {\n        InputStream inStream = theProcess.getInputStream();\n        int data;\n        while ((data = inStream.read()) != -1) {\n            System.out.print((char) data);\n        }\n    } catch(IOException e) {\n        System.err.println(\"Error on inStream.read()\");\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    }\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: \nTo run a `mvn` command from a Java program, you can use the `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()` method to execute the command.
