First, create a StringTokenizer object with the string and delimiter as parameters. In this case, the delimiter is a space (\" \"). Then, use the nextToken method to obtain the first token, which is the name. Assign it to a separate variable, such as firstName. Next, use the nextToken method again to obtain the second token, which is the number as a string. Assign it to a separate variable, such as numberString. Finally, use Double.parseDouble to convert the numberString into a double variable, such as number. This will allow you to separate the name and number into different variables.", "gpt_response": {"id": "chatcmpl-8WhsU7q82h25nR2ZQNTdua5IoYeW1", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1702805854, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: \nString name = \"John 20150.00\";\nStringTokenizer tokenizer = new StringTokenizer(name, \" \");\nString firstName = tokenizer.nextToken();\nString numberString = tokenizer.nextToken();\ndouble number = Double.parseDouble(numberString);\n<<<explanation>>>: \nTo break up the name and number into different variables, you can use the StringTokenizer.nextToken method.
