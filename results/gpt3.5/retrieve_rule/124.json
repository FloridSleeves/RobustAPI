It's pretty simple - it sends some data to a UDP port and looks at the result. I'm not a Python guy, and haven't done too much socket programming, but I've figured out the translation of everything except one line:packet = (b'\\x0C\\x15\\x33\\x00' + os.urandom(4) + (b'\\x00' * 38) + struct.pack('<H', len(enccmd)) + enccmd).ljust(512, b'\\x00')enccmd is a string containing a command that was encoded previously/This is building the data packet that's going to be sent. I know that this translates into the creation of a DatagramPacket object, I just don't know how to do it.Can anyone help?\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: DataOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nbyte[] packet = new byte[512];\nbyte[] enccmdBytes = enccmd.getBytes(\"UTF-8\");\nint packetLength = 12 + 4 + 38 + 2 + enccmdBytes.length;\nSystem.arraycopy(new byte[]{0x0C, 0x15, 0x33, 0x00}, 0, packet, 0, 4);\nSystem.arraycopy(os.urandom(4), 0, packet, 4, 4);\nSystem.arraycopy(new byte[38], 0, packet, 8, 38);\nSystem.arraycopy(ByteBuffer.allocate(2).order(ByteOrder.LITTLE_ENDIAN).putShort((short) enccmdBytes.length).array(), 0, packet, 46, 2);\nSystem.arraycopy(enccmdBytes, 0, packet, 48, enccmdBytes.length);\nArrays.fill(packet, 48 + enccmdBytes.length, 512, (byte) 0x00);\n\nDataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(outputStream);\ndos.write(packet);\ndos.close();\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: \nIn the given Python code, a byte array `packet` is created and filled with specific values.
