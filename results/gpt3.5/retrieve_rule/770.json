The servlet works fine and outputs a html page. However, the linked image is not displayed (missing).This is a small piece of my code to setup the server ...    // Set handler 1 (Display Html)    ServletContextHandler context = new ServletContextHandler(ServletContextHandler.SESSIONS);    context.setContextPath(\"/\");    context.addServlet(new ServletHolder(hws),\"/hello\");    // Set handler 2 (For the images)    WebAppContext wac = new WebAppContext();    wac.setContextPath(\"/img\");    // Attach handlers to server    handlerList.setHandlers(new Handler[]{context,wac});    myServer.setHandler(handlerList);A piece of the servlet that ouputs the html ...    PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();    response.setContentType( \"text/html\");    out.println( \"<html><head><title>Hellow World</title></head>\");    out.println( \"<body><h1>Hello World</h1>\" );       out.println( \"<img src=\\\"/img/img.jpg\\\">\" );    out.println( \"</body></html>\");    out.close();The image file (img.jpg) is after the build, located in a subfolder \"img\" in the root of the jar file ...I would like to use many more images, css files and javascripts.
