Improve this question                    I have a string 'line' in java containing numbers , for example , \"34 55  64 \"I want to store these 3 numbers in  int x , y ,zwhen I do ,x = Integer.parseInt(line[0]) y = Integer.parseInt(line[1])I get an error saying a \"array required but string found \" . I do not understand why it needs an array x,y,z are declared integers and line is declared as a string\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: \nString line = \"34 55 64\";\nStringTokenizer tokenizer = new StringTokenizer(line);\nint x = Integer.parseInt(tokenizer.nextToken());\nint y = Integer.parseInt(tokenizer.nextToken());\nint z = Integer.parseInt(tokenizer.nextToken());\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nTo parse numbers in a string using the StringTokenizer.nextToken API, you first need to create a StringTokenizer object with the string you want to parse as the input.
