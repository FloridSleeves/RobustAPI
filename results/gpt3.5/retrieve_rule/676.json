However, you are not using it correctly. The write method of PrintWriter does not automatically add a new line character at the end of the text. So, you need to manually add a new line character if you want each text to be on a new line in the file.\n\nAdditionally, you don't need to use JOptionPane.showMessageDialog to display messages. You can simply use System.out.println to print messages to the console.\n\nHere is the corrected code:\n\npublic void savefile() throws IOException {\n    FileWriter write = new FileWriter(\"asd.txt\", true);\n    PrintWriter print = new PrintWriter(write);\n    print.println(\"Knock Knock\");\n    print.flush();\n    print.println(\"Hello ?\");\n    print.flush();\n    print.println(\"Hi?\");\n    print.flush();\n    print.println(\"anybody there?\");\n    print.flush();\n    print.close();\n}\n\nNow, when you call the savefile method, it will write the text to the file \"asd.txt\" and each text will be on a new line.", "gpt_response": {"id": "chatcmpl-8WgxLkWuLsiGLtCCrl5myY8CwAmwP", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1702802311, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: \npublic void savefile() throws IOException {\n    FileWriter write = new FileWriter(\"asd.txt\", true);\n    PrintWriter print = new PrintWriter(write);\n    print.write(\"Knock Knock\");\n    print.flush();\n    print.write(\"Hello ?\");\n    print.flush();\n    print.write(\"Hi?\");\n    print.flush();\n    print.write(\"anybody there?\");\n    print.flush();\n    print.close();\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nIn your code, you are using the PrintWriter.write method to write text to a file.
