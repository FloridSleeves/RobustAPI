{"api": "SortedMap.firstKey", "prompt": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nFor API SortedMap.firstKey, the API usage rule is: Retrieve the first key from the SortedMap, but only if the map's size is greater than zero (rcv.size() > 0). Additionally, ensure that the map is not null or empty (!(rcv == null || rcv.isEmpty())) and that it is not empty (!rcv.isEmpty()).\nQuestion: Access to the key-value pair of a Map with one element in Java: :A method of mine returns a Map<A,B>. In some clearly identified cases, the map only contains one key-value pair, effectively only being a wrapper for the two objects.Is there an efficient / elegant / clear way to access both the key and the value? It seems overkill to iterate over the one-element entry set. I'm looking for somehing that would lower the brain power required for people who will maintain this, along the lines of:(...)// Only one result.else {    A leKey = map.getKey(whicheverYouWantThereIsOnlyOne); // Is there something like this?    B leValue = map.get(leKey); // This actually exists. Any Daft Punk reference was non-intentional.}Edit: I ended up going with @akoskm solution's below. In the end, the only satisfying way of doing this without iteration was with a TreeMap, and the overhead made that unreasonable. It turns out there is not always a silver bullet, especially as this would be a very small rabbit to kill with it.\nPlease using this api: SortedMap.firstKey.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: SortedMap.firstKey()\n<<<code>>>: \nif (map != null && !map.isEmpty()) {\n    A leKey = map.firstKey();\n    B leValue = map.get(leKey);\n    // Use leKey and leValue as needed\n} else {\n    // Handle case when map is null or empty\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: \nTo access the key-value pair of a Map with one element efficiently, you can use the SortedMap.firstKey() method.
