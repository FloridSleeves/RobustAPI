In Windows, the line separator is \"\\r\\n\". By using the write method and explicitly adding \"\\r\\n\" at the end of each line, you can ensure that the output is formatted correctly for Windows. Additionally, make sure to call the flush method to ensure that the data is actually written to the file."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: PrintWriter#println method not working as expected: :This code:PrintWriter output = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(outputFile, false));output.println(\"something\\n\");output.println(\"something else\\n\");Outputs:somethingsomething elseInstead of:somethingsomething elseI tried using \"\\r\\n\" instead of just \"\\n\" but it just doesn't work like how I want it to. How do I fix this?P.S. I'm using windows 7\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
