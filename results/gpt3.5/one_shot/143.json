The DocumentFile class is part of the Android framework and is designed to work with content providers and URIs. It provides a higher-level abstraction for working with files and does not have a direct equivalent to RandomAccessFile.\n\nIf you need to perform random access operations on a file, you can consider using the FileChannel class in combination with a regular File object. You can obtain a File object from a DocumentFile by calling the getUri() method and then creating a File object using the URI.\n\nOnce you have the File object, you can create a RandomAccessFile by passing the File object to its constructor. From there, you can use the RandomAccessFile's methods to perform random access operations on the file.\n\nHere's an example of how you can obtain a RandomAccessFile from a DocumentFile:\n\nDocumentFile documentFile = ...; // Obtain the DocumentFile object\nUri uri = documentFile.getUri();\nFile file = new File(uri.getPath());\nRandomAccessFile randomAccessFile = new RandomAccessFile(file, \"rw\");\n\nNow you can use the randomAccessFile object to perform random access operations on the file.\n\nNote that this approach assumes that you have the necessary permissions to access the file. You may need to request the appropriate permissions from the user if you don't already have them."

I wrote objects at various locations in the file. The objects were of variable sizes but all of the same class.Now I want to read from such a file. I dont want to have to specify the number of bytes to read. I want to be able to read the object directly using Object Input Stream. How to achieve this ? I have to use Random Access Files because I need to write to different positions in file. I am also recording in a separate data structure, the locations where objects have been written.\nPlease using this api: FileChannel.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileChannel.write\n<<<code>>>: while(rbb.hasRemaining()) {\n        try{\n            fileChannel.writeLong(recordBytes.length);\n            fileChannel.write(rbb);\n        } catch {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");}\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The simplest solution that comes to mind is to write out the length of the array before writing out the array itself. When reading the object, you first read the length. This'll tell you how many further bytes to read to get your object. Similarly to what you are already doing on the writing side, you could read the data into a byte[] and then use ByteArrayInputputStream and ObjectInputStream.\nQuestion: DocumentFile RandomAccessFile: :Is there any way get a RandomAccessFile from a given DocumentFile?I know it is possible to get an InputStream via getUriInputStream inputStream = getContentResolver().openInputStream(DocumentFile.getUri());But I need a RandomAccessFileThanks for your help,Jens\nPlease using this api: FileChannel.write.\nAnswer:"
