To ensure that all the data is written to the file, you need to manually flush the stream by calling the flush() method or closing the PrintWriter. In the provided code, I have used the close() method to automatically flush and close the stream."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Printwriter to write into a file: :Why can't I write a big amount of data via PrintWriter?String result = acquireLengthyData();PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(\"D:/log.txt\");out.println(result);where result.lenght() = 189718. But some data were missing in log.txt. Why? How can I write to the file correctly?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
