You can use the `hasMoreTokens()` method to check if there are more tokens available before calling `nextToken()`. This way, you can handle cases where there is no second token or no first token."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: NoSuchToken exception for StringTokenizer.nextToken(): :When I try to run the code:     import java.io.*;    import java.util.*;    class dothis {      public static void main (String [] args) throws IOException {        BufferedReader f = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"ride.in\"));        PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(\"ride.out\")));        StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(f.readLine());        String s1 = st.nextToken();            String s2 = st.nextToken();                char[] arr = new char[6];        if (find(s1, arr, 1) == find(s2, arr, 1)) {            out.print(\"one\");        } else {            out.println(\"two\");         }        out.close();                                        }    }With the data file:    ABCDEF    WERTYUit keeps on outputting:    Exception_in_thread_\"main\"_java.util.NoSuchElementException        at_java.util.StringTokenizer.nextToken(StringTokenizer.java:349)        at_dothis.main(Unknown_Source)I did see a similar question on Stack Overflow, but in that case, the second line of the text file is blank, therefore there wasn't a second token to be read. However, the two first lines of this data file both contain a String. How come a token would not be read for the second line?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
