One way to achieve this is by using a BufferedOutputStream as an intermediary stream.\n\nHere is an example of how you can switch between ObjectOutputStream, DataOutputStream, and PrintWriter:\n\n1. Create a BufferedOutputStream using the socket's output stream:\n   BufferedOutputStream bufferedOutputStream = new BufferedOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());\n\n2. Create the desired output stream objects:\n   ObjectOutputStream objectOutputStream = new ObjectOutputStream(bufferedOutputStream);\n   DataOutputStream dataOutputStream = new DataOutputStream(bufferedOutputStream);\n   PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(bufferedOutputStream);\n\n3. Use the appropriate output stream based on your needs:\n   // Sending a text command \"INFO\"\n   dataOutputStream.writeBytes(\"INFO\\n\");\n   dataOutputStream.flush();\n\n   // Sending an object with information\n   objectOutputStream.writeObject(object);\n   objectOutputStream.flush();\n\n   // Sending a text command \"DATA\"\n   printWriter.println(\"DATA\");\n   printWriter.flush();\n\nNote that you need to flush the output stream after writing to ensure that the data is sent immediately.\n\nBy using a BufferedOutputStream, you can switch between different types of output streams without closing and reopening the socket."

Is this possible and what is the best way to do it?I've tried just creating both types of objects, for example ObjectOutputStream and DataOutputStream, but that doesn't seem to work.The reason I want to switch between them is to, for example, send a text command \"INFO\" that signals I'm about to send an object with information or a command \"DATA\" signalling that I'm about to send data.
