The SortedSet and SortedMap interfaces are designed to provide a sorted way to access elements in a set and map respectively. However, there is no specific SortedList interface or class in the Java Collections framework. This may be because lists in Java are typically ordered by their insertion order, rather than being inherently sorted. If you need to sort a list, you can use the java.util.Collections.sort() method to sort the elements in the list."

Both belong to the Java Collections framework and provide a sorted way to access the elements. However, in my understanding there is no SortedList in Java. You can use java.util.Collections.sort() to sort a list.Any idea why it is designed like that?\nPlease using this api: List.get.\nAnswer:"
