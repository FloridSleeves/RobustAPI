In this example, a buffer of size 4096 is used to read and write the data in chunks. The while loop continues until there are no more bytes to read from the input stream. Finally, the output stream and player are closed."

The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Write mp3 file to disk while playing in Java: :I have an application playing remote MP3 files over HTTP using the JLayer/BasicPlayer libraries. I want to save the played mp3 files to disk without re-downloading them.This is the code using the JLayer based BasicPlayer for Playing the MP3 file.String mp3Url = \"http://ia600402.us.archive.org/6/items/Stockfinster.-DeadLinesutemos025/01_Push_Push.mp3\";URL url = new URL(mp3Url);URLConnection conn = url.openConnection();InputStream is = conn.getInputStream();BufferedInputStream bis = new BufferedInputStream(is);BasicPlayer player = new BasicPlayer();player.open(bis);player.play();How would I save the mp3 file to disk?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
