I am confused how does it work? why doesn't it give error just like we get in java code? and most importantly, how does environment decide to which component it needs to invoke? I understand the process of id generation is automated, which gets added to R.java For instance, if we have same IDs, say \"image1\" in two XMLs, say \"layout1\" & \"layout2\". but in R.java it won't have 2 IDs. that means at a time it will reference only 1 component. In case we have to use 2 XMLs in an Activity, one as activity.setcontentview(layout1) and another as a PopupWindow.setContentView(layout2). What will happen in such case?\nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Activity.setContentView\n<<<code>>>: @Override\npublic void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n    Button myButton = (Button) findViewById(R.id.my_button);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You can findViewById of the current view hierarchy set to the activity. You cannot have same id for the view's in the same view tree. (must be unique).\nQuestion: Using putExtra in intent to display specific layout in new activity: :i am curious how i go about using the putExtra(\"something\", something);in a intent to a new activity inside my application, Intent i = new Intent(getApplicationContext(), MainActivity.class);i.putExtra(\"something\", something)startActivity(i);I need to know how i would the sending and receiving end would look like, For Loading a specific layout file depending on what was sent via the putExtra in the intent.So if i send the i.putExtra(\"a\", a) on the receiving end, it would create a content view with R.layout.a_layout.xmlbut if i sent i.putExtra(\"b\", b) it would load R.layout.b_layout.xmlAny ideas?\nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer:"
