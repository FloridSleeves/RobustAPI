The last 6 bytes in my files contain crucial information when writing the files back. I need to write my original files, and then append the last 6 bytes elsewhere. Any guidance? Thanks\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: RandomAccessFile.read\n<<<code>>>: RandomAccessFile randomAccessFile = new RandomAccessFile(your_file, \"r\");randomAccessFile.seek(your_file.length() - n);try{randomAccessFile.read(byteArray, 0, n);} catch(IOException e) {e.printStackTrace();} \n<<<explanation>>>: You have to do it by using RandomAccessFile. Instances of this class support both reading and writing to a random access file. A random access file behaves like a large array of bytes stored in the file system. \nQuestion: How to read a binary file starting from a specific part: :What I did in my code was to simply append a tag then some string data to a binary file using the append flag of FileOutputStream. Now, how do I read starting from the tag specified? I'm not sure where to start. The file and string sizes are variable so I couldn't really trust it. The only thing constant is the tag.EDIT: I forgot to mention that the file will be accessed from another thread/activity/app/device.Code used for appending some data:String TAG = \"CLIPPYDATA-\";String content = \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\"; //size not fixed, sample purpose only.FileOutputStream output = new FileOutputStream(\"/path/to/file\", true);try {        output.write((TAG + content).getBytes());} finally {        //output.flush(); (should I?)        output.close();}Sample output:yyvA\u017e\u00ee\u00e9\u00c3I&8Q\u00c0 \u00d8 +Z\u0160( \u00a2\u0160( \u00a2\u0160(\u00ff\u00d9CLIPPYDATA-The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.Sample input:yyvA\u017e\u00ee\u00e9\u00c3I&8Q\u00c0 \u00d8 +Z\u0160( \u00a2\u0160( \u00a2\u0160(\u00ff\u00d9CLIPPYDATA-The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.Desired Output:CLIPPYDATA-The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:"
