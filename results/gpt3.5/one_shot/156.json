In the while loop, update the bytesRead variable with the number of bytes read in each iteration. Then, use this value to calculate the progress as a percentage of the total size and update the ProgressDialog using pd.setProgress()."

The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Monitoring BufferedInputStream download progress: :I'm trying to download a file using an AsyncTask on Android. I want to display a ProgressDialog which should have a progress bar to show the status of the download. I'm using the onProgressUpdate() function for that and implemented a call to publishProgress() in my doInBackground() function. However, the progress dialog only pops up after downloading the file. My code:protected Long doInBackground(URL...urls) {    for (int i = 0; i < urls.length; i++) {        url = urls[i];        try {            URLConnection conn = url.openConnection();            conn.connect();            totalSize = conn.getContentLength();            BufferedInputStream bis = new BufferedInputStream(url.openStream());            FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().getPath() + \"/forvo_temp.mp3\");            BufferedOutputStream bos = new BufferedOutputStream(fos,1024);            byte [] data = new byte[1024];            int x=0; int c=0;            while((x=bis.read(data,0,1024))>=0){                bos.write(data,0,x);                c += 1024;                publishProgress(c);            }        } catch (Exception e) {            e.printStackTrace();        }    }    return 0L; // Don't know what to do with this}protected void onProgressUpdate(Integer...args) {    pd = ProgressDialog.show(context, \"Downloading...\", \"Downloading...\", true, false);    pd.setProgress(args[0] / totalSize);}I guess the whole file is downloaded when I call new BufferedInputStream(url.openStream()). How can I monitor the download progress?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
