You can then access any node in O(1) time by using the List.get method with the index of the desired node.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n// Create a Doubly Linked List\nDoublyLinkedList list = new DoublyLinkedList();\n\n// Add nodes to the list\nlist.addNode(1);\nlist.addNode(2);\nlist.addNode(3);\nlist.addNode(4);\nlist.addNode(5);\n\n// Create an ArrayList to map the nodes\nList<Node> nodeList = new ArrayList<>();\n\n// Add each node to the ArrayList\nNode currentNode = list.getHead();\nwhile (currentNode != null) {\n    nodeList.add(currentNode);\n    currentNode = currentNode.getNext();\n}\n\n// Access a node in O(1) time\nNode node = nodeList.get(2); // Access the node at index 2\n\n// Move a node to the end of the list in O(1) time\nNode nodeToMove = nodeList.get(4); // Access the node with ID 5\nlist.moveNodeToEnd(nodeToMove);\n\n<<<explanation>>>: In this example, we first create a Doubly Linked List and add nodes to it. Then, we create an ArrayList called \"nodeList\" to map the nodes. We iterate through the Linked List and add each node to the ArrayList. Now, we can access any node in O(1) time by using the List.get method with the index of the desired node. To move a node with a specific ID to the end of the list, we can use the List.get method to access the node, and then use the Doubly Linked List's moveNodeToEnd method to move the node to the end of the list."

I know that if i traverse the list to find a certain node it would take O(n) time so I want to map the nodes to an array list where I can access the nodes in O(1) time.I'm really unsure how I would do this mapping. I would like to see an example of how this can be done.Edit:I would like to be able to access any node in the linked list so I can move the nodes around in O(1) time.Example: Move node with ID 5 to end of list in O(1) time. Edit 2: I uploaded a picture example of what I'm trying to accomplish\nPlease using this api: List.get.\nAnswer:"
