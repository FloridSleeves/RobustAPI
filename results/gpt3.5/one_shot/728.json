This will open the file in append mode. Then, you can use the PrintWriter's write method to write each line to the file. Finally, remember to close the PrintWriter to ensure that all the data is flushed to the file."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: using for loop write lines one by one in file using java: :                                It's difficult to tell what is being asked here.
