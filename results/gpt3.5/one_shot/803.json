By passing true as the second argument to the FileWriter constructor, you can enable append mode. Then, you can use the println method of PrintWriter to write the text to the file, followed by closing the PrintWriter to ensure that the changes are saved."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Is there a File.AppendAllText() in Java?: :Is there some clean static method to just dump (append) a string to a file?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
