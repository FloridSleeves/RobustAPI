The DataOutputStream class is mainly used for writing primitive data types to an output stream.\n\nTo send HTTP trailers/footers in a chunked response from within a Java servlet, you can use the HttpServletResponse class and its setTrailerFields() method. Here's an example:\n\n// Set the response headers\nresponse.setHeader(\"Transfer-Encoding\", \"chunked\");\nresponse.setHeader(\"Trailer\", \"SomeTrailer\");\n\n// Write the response data\nServletOutputStream outputStream = response.getOutputStream();\noutputStream.write(data);\n\n// Set the trailer fields\nresponse.setTrailerFields(() -> {\n    PrintWriter writer = response.getWriter();\n    writer.println(\"SomeTrailer: [value]\");\n});\n\nNote that the setTrailerFields() method takes a Supplier<PrintWriter> as an argument, which allows you to write the trailer fields using a PrintWriter.\n\nPlease note that HTTP trailers/footers are not widely supported by all clients and servers. It's recommended to use them only when necessary and ensure that the client and server support them."
