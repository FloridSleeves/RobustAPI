Instead, you should create the PrintWriter object outside the loop and write each line to the file within the loop. Additionally, you can use FileWriter to directly write to the file."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Grep output to file (Java): :How can I store the output of a grep in a file using Java?I'm using Runtime and Process to execute the grep, then I read the InputStreamBufferedReader stdInput = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(pr.getInputStream()));and now I'd like to store the content of the grep in a file, but I'm getting an empty file.With String s = null;while ((s = stdInput.readLine()) != null) {    System.out.println(s);}I am correctly seeing the grep's output. However, when I try to write it to a file, the file is empty.PrintWriter writer = null;writer = new PrintWriter(\"grep__output\", \"UTF-8\");writer.println(s);writer.close();Also, I tried to directly writing to file in the above while (previously creating the file), but it's the same.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
