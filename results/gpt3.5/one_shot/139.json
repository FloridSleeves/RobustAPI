MappedByteBuffer uses memory-mapped files, which have limitations on the maximum size that can be mapped.\n\nTo overcome this issue, you can write the byte array in smaller chunks instead of trying to map the entire array at once. Here's an example of how you can modify your code to write the byte array in chunks:\n\nprivate static final int CHUNK_SIZE = 1024 * 1024; // 1MB\n\nprivate static void write(byte[] data) throws Exception {\n    File file = new File(\"C:/temp/file.json\");\n    int length = data.length;\n    RandomAccessFile raf = new RandomAccessFile(file, \"rw\");\n    FileChannel fc = raf.getChannel();\n    \n    int position = 0;\n    while (position < length) {\n        int remaining = length - position;\n        int chunkSize = Math.min(remaining, CHUNK_SIZE);\n        MappedByteBuffer buffer = fc.map(FileChannel.MapMode.READ_WRITE, position, chunkSize);\n        buffer.put(data, position, chunkSize);\n        position += chunkSize;\n    }\n    \n    fc.close();\n    raf.close();\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: In this modified code, we introduce a CHUNK_SIZE constant that represents the size of each chunk to be written. We then iterate over the byte array in chunks, mapping and writing each chunk separately. This allows you to write large byte arrays without exceeding the limitations of memory-mapped files."

I wrote objects at various locations in the file. The objects were of variable sizes but all of the same class.Now I want to read from such a file. I dont want to have to specify the number of bytes to read. I want to be able to read the object directly using Object Input Stream. How to achieve this ? I have to use Random Access Files because I need to write to different positions in file. I am also recording in a separate data structure, the locations where objects have been written.\nPlease using this api: FileChannel.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileChannel.write\n<<<code>>>: while(rbb.hasRemaining()) {\n        try{\n            fileChannel.writeLong(recordBytes.length);\n            fileChannel.write(rbb);\n        } catch {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");}\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The simplest solution that comes to mind is to write out the length of the array before writing out the array itself. When reading the object, you first read the length. This'll tell you how many further bytes to read to get your object. Similarly to what you are already doing on the writing side, you could read the data into a byte[] and then use ByteArrayInputputStream and ObjectInputStream.\nQuestion: IOException when writing byte array: :I am getting IOException: Map Failed when trying to write a large byte array. I use the method below to write a byte array to a fileprivate static void write(byte[] data) throws Exception {        File file = new File(\"C:/temp/file.json\");        int length = data.length;        RandomAccessFile raf = new RandomAccessFile(file, \"rw\");        FileChannel fc = raf.getChannel();        MappedByteBuffer buffer = fc.map(FileChannel.MapMode.READ_WRITE, 0, length);        for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {            buffer.put(data[i]);        }}The byte array is about 270mb. Can anyone explain what I am doing wrong? Thanks.\nPlease using this api: FileChannel.write.\nAnswer:"
