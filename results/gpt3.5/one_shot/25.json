If the permission is not granted, you can disable the callButton using callButton.setEnabled(false) and change its text using callButton.setText(\"Call function not available\"). This way, when the app is first opened on a tablet without the call function, the button will be disabled and show the appropriate text."

I am confused how does it work? why doesn't it give error just like we get in java code? and most importantly, how does environment decide to which component it needs to invoke? I understand the process of id generation is automated, which gets added to R.java For instance, if we have same IDs, say \"image1\" in two XMLs, say \"layout1\" & \"layout2\". but in R.java it won't have 2 IDs. that means at a time it will reference only 1 component. In case we have to use 2 XMLs in an Activity, one as activity.setcontentview(layout1) and another as a PopupWindow.setContentView(layout2). What will happen in such case?\nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Activity.setContentView\n<<<code>>>: @Override\npublic void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n    Button myButton = (Button) findViewById(R.id.my_button);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You can findViewById of the current view hierarchy set to the activity. You cannot have same id for the view's in the same view tree. (must be unique).\nQuestion: Disabling Android Button depending on Permissions: :I have an android app that uses the permission \"CALL_PHONE\". This simple app would just contain a button that would use the call intent to call a specific number. I would like to install this app on both tablets and phone but when it is installed on the tablet, I would like the button to be disabled during runtime so errors wouldn't show when the user tries to call using the tablet without a call function. At the moment, I am using the setEnabled() and setClickable() method in my MainActivity.java and setting it to false when the user clicks on the button the first time. My question is whether the button can be disabled and the text changed during runtime or when the app is first opened (in a tablet) so the user wouldn't have to click the button first for it to show that the \"call\" button should be disabled and unclickable?\nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer:"
