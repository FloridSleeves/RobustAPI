You should use PrintWriter.println() instead, which adds a line break after the message. Additionally, you need to call PrintWriter.flush() to ensure that the message is immediately sent to the server."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Getting Null String when reading from a socket: :I am trying to write a client-server system using Sockets in java, however I cannot seem to read data sent from the server to the client.Here is the code for the client:public class ClientSocket {    Socket clientSocket = null;    PrintWriter out = null;    BufferedReader in = null;    // establish a connection to All Care's server application through socket 4444 (adjust localhost to reflect the IP address that the server    // is being run from)    public ClientSocket()    {        try        {            clientSocket = new Socket(\"localhost\", 4445);            out = new PrintWriter(clientSocket.getOutputStream());            in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(clientSocket.getInputStream()));        }        catch (IOException e)        {            System.out.println(\"Could not connect to All Care Server Application\");        }    }    public void closeClientSocket()    {           try        {            clientSocket.close();        }        catch (IOException e)        {            System.out.println(\"Could not close connection to All Care Server Application\");        }    }    public String getMessageFromServer()    {        try        {            String input = in.readLine();            return input;        }        catch (IOException e)        {            System.out.println(\"Could not read message from server\");        }        return \"No Data\";    }    public void sendMessageToServer(String message)    {        out.write(message);    }}And here is the Server code:public class ArFileServer {    public static void main(String[] args)     {        ServerSocket serverSocket = null;        boolean listening = true;        try        {            serverSocket = new ServerSocket(4445);            // infinite loop to continually listen for connection requests made by clients            while (listening)            {                new ClientConnection(serverSocket.accept()).start();                if (serverSocket != null)                {                    System.out.println(\"Connection to client established\");                }            }            serverSocket.close();        }        catch (IOException e)        {            System.out.println(\"Error could not create socket connection to port\");        }    }}public class ClientConnection extends Thread{    private Socket socket = null;    public ClientConnection(Socket socket)     {        super(\"ClientConnection\");        this.socket = socket;     }    // the thread that runs after a connection to the server has been accepted    @Override    public void run()    {        try        {            PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream());            BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));            sendMessagetoClient(out, \"CONNECTION SUCCESS\");            // check login credentials sent from client to the server            // if valid send back their encrypted password, otherwise output a login error message            // wait for user input and then do various processes based on their requests            in.close();            out.close();            socket.close();        }        catch (IOException e)        {            System.out.println(\"Client socket connection error\");        }    }    // sends a message to the client    void sendMessagetoClient(PrintWriter out, String message)    {        out.write(message);    }     // listens for a message from the client    String getMessageFromClient(BufferedReader in)    {              try        {            String input = in.readLine();            return input;        }        catch (IOException e)        {            System.out.println(\"Could not read message from client\");        }        return \"No Data\";    }And here is the line of code im using to see if the data is being sent.System.out.println(clientSocket.getMessageFromServer());\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
