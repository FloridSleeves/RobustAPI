In your code, you are setting a custom view called myView. To resize the dialog to wrap the content of the custom view, you can try using the WindowManager.LayoutParams approach. Here's an example:\n\n@Override\npublic Dialog onCreateDialog(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n    // Create the dialog\n    AlertDialog.Builder db = new AlertDialog.Builder(getActivity());\n    db.setTitle(\"Test Alert Dialog:\");\n    db.setView(new myView(getActivity()));\n\n    // Get the dialog and its window\n    final AlertDialog dialog = db.create();\n    final Window window = dialog.getWindow();\n\n    // Set the layout params to wrap content\n    WindowManager.LayoutParams layoutParams = new WindowManager.LayoutParams();\n    layoutParams.copyFrom(window.getAttributes());\n    layoutParams.width = WindowManager.LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT;\n    layoutParams.height = WindowManager.LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT;\n    window.setAttributes(layoutParams);\n\n    return dialog;\n}\n\nThis code gets the dialog and its window, then sets the layout params to wrap content. This should resize the dialog to fit the content of the custom view."

I am confused how does it work? why doesn't it give error just like we get in java code? and most importantly, how does environment decide to which component it needs to invoke? I understand the process of id generation is automated, which gets added to R.java For instance, if we have same IDs, say \"image1\" in two XMLs, say \"layout1\" & \"layout2\". but in R.java it won't have 2 IDs. that means at a time it will reference only 1 component. In case we have to use 2 XMLs in an Activity, one as activity.setcontentview(layout1) and another as a PopupWindow.setContentView(layout2). What will happen in such case?\nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Activity.setContentView\n<<<code>>>: @Override\npublic void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n    Button myButton = (Button) findViewById(R.id.my_button);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You can findViewById of the current view hierarchy set to the activity. You cannot have same id for the view's in the same view tree. (must be unique).\nQuestion: AlertDialog with custom view: Resize to wrap the view's content: :I have been having this problem in an application I am building. Please ignore all of the design shortcomings and lack of best practice approaches, this is purely to show an example of what I cannot solve.I have DialogFragment which returns a basic AlertDialog with a custom View set using AlertDialog.Builder.setView(). If this View has a specific size requirement, how do I get the Dialog to correctly resize itself to display all of the content in the custom View?This is the example code I have been using:package com.test.test;import android.os.Bundle;import android.app.Activity;import android.app.AlertDialog;import android.app.Dialog;import android.app.DialogFragment;import android.content.Context;import android.graphics.Canvas;import android.graphics.Color;import android.graphics.Paint;import android.graphics.Paint.Style;import android.view.Gravity;import android.view.LayoutInflater;import android.view.View;import android.view.WindowManager;import android.view.View.OnClickListener;import android.view.ViewGroup;import android.view.ViewGroup.LayoutParams;import android.widget.ArrayAdapter;import android.widget.Button;import android.widget.EditText;import android.widget.FrameLayout;import android.widget.LinearLayout;import android.widget.Spinner;import android.widget.TextView;public class MainActivity extends Activity {    @Override    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);        // Use a button for launching        Button b = new Button(this);        b.setText(\"Launch\");        b.setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener() {                @Override            public void onClick(View v) {                // Launch the dialog                myDialog d = new myDialog();                d.show(getFragmentManager(), null);            }        });        setContentView(b);    }    public static class myDialog extends DialogFragment {        @Override        public Dialog onCreateDialog(Bundle savedInstanceState) {                       // Create the dialog            AlertDialog.Builder db = new AlertDialog.Builder(getActivity());            db.setTitle(\"Test Alert Dialog:\");            db.setView(new myView(getActivity()));            return db.create();        }        protected class myView extends View {            Paint p = null;            public myView(Context ct) {                super(ct);                // Setup paint for the drawing                p = new Paint();                p.setColor(Color.MAGENTA);                p.setStyle(Style.STROKE);                p.setStrokeWidth(10);            }            @Override            protected void onMeasure(int widthMeasureSpec, int heightMeasureSpec) {                setMeasuredDimension(800, 300);            }            @Override            protected void onDraw(Canvas canvas) {                // Draw a rectangle showing the bounds of the view                canvas.drawRect(0, 0, getMeasuredWidth(), getMeasuredHeight(), p);            }        }    }}A Button is created, which opens the DialogFragment on a click. The custom View (myView) is required to have a width of 800 and height of 300 which is correctly set in an override of onMeasure(). This View, draws its measured bounds in magenta for debugging purposes.The 800 width is wider than the default Dialog size on my device, but is clipped rather than stretching correctly.I have looked through the following solutions:DialogFragment.getDialog returns nullHow to control the width and height of the default Alert Dialog in Android?Size of Alert Dialog or Custom Alert DialogI have deduced the following two coding approaches:Get the WindowManager.LayoutParams of the Dialog and override them using myDialog.getDialog().getWindow().get/setAttributes()Using the setLayout(w, h) method through myDialog.getDialog().getWindow().setLayout()I have tried them everywhere I can think of (overriding onStart(), in a onShowListener, after the Dialog is created and shown, etc) and can generally get both methods to work correctly if the LayoutParams are supplied a specific value. But whenever WRAP_CONTENT is supplied, nothing happens.Any suggestions?EDIT:Screenshot of the situation:Screenshot of a specific value (note 900 is entered here, 850 doesn't cover the entire width of the View, which makes sense given the entire window is being adjusted. So that provides - if another was needed - reason why WRAP_CONTENT is essential / fixed values are not appropriate):\nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer:"
