However, you can achieve this by using an iterator explicitly.\nHere's an example of how you can refer to the previous and next elements using an iterator:\n\nIterator<Object> iterator = col.iterator();\nObject previous = null;\nObject current = null;\nObject next = null;\n\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\n    previous = current;\n    current = next;\n    next = iterator.next();\n\n    // Perform your search and code execution here\n    if (current.equals(searchItem)) {\n        // Code for previous item\n        if (previous != null) {\n            // Perform code on previous item\n        }\n\n        // Code for current item\n        // Perform code on current item\n\n        // Code for next item\n        if (next != null) {\n            // Perform code on next item\n        }\n    }\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: In this code, we use an iterator to iterate over the collection. We keep track of the previous, current, and next elements as we iterate. Inside the loop, you can perform your search and execute code on the previous, current, and next elements as needed."

Try to just use the value of the foreach inside the loop.\nQuestion: How do I refer to the previous and next element during an iteration?: :When I have a for loop, I use the i to refer to the elements of my array, objects, etc.  Like:Current item: myArray[i]Next item: myArray[i+1]Previous item: myArray[i-1] But at the moment, I'm using a foreach loop ( for (Object elem : col) { ).How do I refer to the previous item?(I need to do a search an 'array', which I'm doing with for (Object object : getComponents()).  But when it returns true (so it finds what I look for), it should perform the code on the previous and the next item.  Clarification: I have java.awt.Component elements!\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
