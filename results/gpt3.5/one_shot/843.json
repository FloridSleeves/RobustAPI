Here's an example:\n\nprivate class ParseXmlTask extends AsyncTask<Void, Void, String[]> {\n    private ProgressDialog progressDialog;\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onPreExecute() {\n        super.onPreExecute();\n        progressDialog = new ProgressDialog(MainActivity.this);\n        progressDialog.setMessage(\"Parsing...\");\n        progressDialog.show();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected String[] doInBackground(Void... voids) {\n        // Parse the XML file here and return the parsed data\n        return parseXmlFile();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onPostExecute(String[] ret) {\n        super.onPostExecute(ret);\n        progressDialog.dismiss();\n\n        if (ret[0].equals(\"steve\")) {\n            sayHiToSteve();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nvoid onButtonClicked() {\n    new ParseXmlTask().execute();\n}\n\nThis way, the ProgressDialog will be shown while the XML file is being parsed in the background, and the UI will be updated with the parsed data when it's done."

It works fine until screen orientation changes while ProgressDialog is up.

However, since it takes around 3 seconds to complete, i don't just want the screen sitting and waiting for 3 seconds showing nothing. I would like it to display a ProgressDialog. I've tried everything in these threads and while most do 2 / 3, none seem to do all 3.Basically I have a button that when pressed, i want to parse the xml file and then use the data parsed from the file:void onButtonClicked() {    ProgressDialog pd = new ProgressDialog(this);    pd.setMessage(\"Parsing...\");    pd.show();    String[] ret;    return = parseXmlFile();    pd.dismiss();    if (ret[0] == \"steve\") {       sayHiToSteve();    }}  If I use an asyncTask, it will continue on with execution and check ret[0] before the task is completed and will just be null.if i do AsyncTask.get(), it pauses the execution but doesn't display the progress dialog, so that's no good either. I also looked at creating a seperate thread, but i had the same problem. I can't use a timer, because it is about 3 seconds (but can be up to 4 or 5 seconds if connection is slow), so i can't approximate. Any help is much appreciated.Thanks in advance.\nPlease using this api: ProgressDialog.dismiss.\nAnswer:"
