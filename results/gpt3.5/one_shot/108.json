One way to do this is by assigning a unique identifier to each client when they connect to the server. \n\nHere is an example of how you can send a message to a specific client:\n\n1. Maintain a list of connected clients on the server side, along with their unique identifiers.\n\n2. When a client connects to the server, assign a unique identifier to that client and add it to the list of connected clients.\n\n3. When you want to send a message to a specific client, iterate through the list of connected clients and find the client with the desired unique identifier.\n\n4. Once you have identified the client, you can use the DataOutputStream associated with that client's socket to send the message.\n\nHere is a code snippet that demonstrates this concept:\n\n// Maintain a list of connected clients\nList<Client> connectedClients = new ArrayList<>();\n\n// Client class to hold the socket and unique identifier\nclass Client {\n    Socket socket;\n    String clientId;\n\n    public Client(Socket socket, String clientId) {\n        this.socket = socket;\n        this.clientId = clientId;\n    }\n}\n\n// When a client connects, assign a unique identifier and add it to the list of connected clients\nSocket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();\nString clientId = generateUniqueId();\nClient client = new Client(clientSocket, clientId);\nconnectedClients.add(client);\n\n// To send a message to a specific client\nString targetClientId = \"client1\"; // Replace with the desired client's unique identifier\nString message = \"Hello client 1!\"; // Replace with the desired message\n\nfor (Client connectedClient : connectedClients) {\n    if (connectedClient.clientId.equals(targetClientId)) {\n        DataOutputStream outputStream = new DataOutputStream(connectedClient.socket.getOutputStream());\n        outputStream.writeBytes(message);\n        break;\n    }\n}\n\nNote: This is just a basic example to demonstrate the concept. In a real-world scenario, you would need to handle error cases, manage the list of connected clients, and handle disconnections properly."
