However, there are a few issues with your implementation. \n\nFirst, you need to initialize the arrays for products and ratings outside the loop. This way, you can store the values for all rows and columns.\n\nSecond, you need to use a for loop instead of a do-while loop to iterate over the lines in the file. This way, you can control the number of iterations and avoid any issues with hasNextLine().\n\nThird, you need to use the nextToken() method to read the values from the StringTokenizer. In the first row, you need to store the values in the products array. In the subsequent rows, you need to parse the values as integers and store them in the ratings array.\n\nFinally, don't forget to close the Scanner after reading the file.\n\nI have made the necessary modifications to your code to address these issues."

If I were to use a couple of Arrays I could have done it a while ago but having to use the StringTokenizer is driving me nuts. The main problem I am having is reading the CSV file. I don't know how to do it and previous searches online have only brought forward super intense solutions that are too much for a beginner like me to handle. This is my code. As you can see, I don't know whether use .nextLine() or .NextToken(). Neither seems to work.For those wondering the assignment is basically reading the first 4 products separated by commas and reading the rest of the rows as the rating of those 4 products. Basically 6 rows with 4 columns. The first row is the products the rest are the ratings.import java.util.StringTokenizer;import java.io.FileInputStream;import java.io.FileNotFoundException;import java.util.Scanner;public class ProductRating {public static void main(String[] args) {    // TODO Auto-generated method stub    Scanner fileIn=null;    try{        fileIn = new Scanner(                 new FileInputStream(\"C:/Users/Cristian/Desktop\"));    }    catch (FileNotFoundException e)     {  // This block executed if the file is not found        // and then the program exits    System.out.println(\"File not found.\");    System.exit(0);    }    //If Opened File Successful this runs    String products = \"A\";    String rantings =\"0\";    System.out.println(\"Gathering Ratings for Products\");    do{        String delimiters = \", \";        StringTokenizer gatherProducts[]=new StringTokenizer[inputLine, delimeters];        gatherProducts=fileIn.nextLine();    }while(fileIn.hasNextLine()==true);}   }\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
