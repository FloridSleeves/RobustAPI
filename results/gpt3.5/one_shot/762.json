Here's an example:\n\nPrintWriter[] printWriters = {printWriter1, printWriter2, printWriter3};\nString text = \"Hello World\";\n\nfor (PrintWriter printWriter : printWriters) {\n    printWriter.write(text);\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: This code creates an array of PrintWriter objects and a string variable with the text you want to write. Then, it uses a for loop to iterate over the array and call the write method on each PrintWriter object, passing the text as an argument. This will write the same text to each PrintWriter object."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: PrintWriter to multiple files: :I need to write the same text to multiple files (or streams).Sometimes I need to use Writer, sometimes a PrintWriter, sometimes a OutputStream...One way to do this wold be to extend a PrintWriter to have an array of PrintWriters and overridde each method as follows:class MutiplePrintWriter extends PrintWriter {    private PrintWriter[] outs;    public MutiplePrintWriter(PrintWriter[] outs) { this.out = out; }    public void print(boolean b) { for (PrintWriter out : outs) print(b); }    public void print(char c) { for (PrintWriter out : outs) print(c); }    public void print(char[] s) { for (PrintWriter out : outs) print(s); }    ...}   (and the same for Writer, OutputStream...)Is there a better alternative?Is this already implemented in a library?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
