In your code, the error occurs because you are calling s2.next() twice in the inner while loop, once inside the if statement and once outside. This causes the second call to throw the exception because there are no more tokens left to read.\n\nTo fix this issue, you can modify your code to only call s2.next() once inside the if statement. This way, it will only be called if there are more tokens available to read."
