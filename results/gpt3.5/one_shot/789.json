However, you need to make sure that the file path \"D:\\\\fff.txt\" is valid and that you have the necessary permissions to create and write to the file. Additionally, you should close the PrintWriter after writing to ensure that the data is flushed and the file is properly closed. The FileNotFoundException is caught to handle any errors that may occur when creating the PrintWriter."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: How do I print the exception stack trace: :package javaapplication1;import java.io.FileNotFoundException;import java.io.PrintWriter;public class multicatch {    public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException {            Throwable t = new Exception(\"Tis is some kind of throwable exception\");              PrintWriter ps=new PrintWriter(\"D:\\\\fff.txt\");  t.printStackTrace(ps);    }}This program creates \"fff.txt\" and it prints nothing in that file.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
