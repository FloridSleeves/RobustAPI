The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: How to execute \"an exe with return value\" in java?: :I created an executable using cpp which accepts two integer values and then returns the sum. I'm executing the EXE with Java using the following code:try {    pr = rt.exec(\"C:\\\\Users\\\\babesha.fm\\\\Desktop\\\\SUM.exe 10 5\");    int exitVal = pr.waitFor();    System.out.println(\"Exited with error code \" + exitVal);} catch (IOException e) {    // TODO Auto-generated catch block    e.printStackTrace();} catch (InterruptedException e) {    // TODO Auto-generated catch block    e.printStackTrace();}I used the return statement while creating the exe.But the problem is when I executed this exe by using the above java code. pr.waitFor(); statement returns the sum value instead of successful exicution.Did I done anything wrong .\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
