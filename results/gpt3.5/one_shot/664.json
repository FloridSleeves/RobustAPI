Instead, you can use the PrintWriter class to write to a file. In the code snippet provided, a PrintWriter is created with a FileWriter to write to the \"file.txt\" file. The write() method is then used to write the desired content to the file. Finally, the PrintWriter is closed to ensure that all the data is flushed and the file is properly closed."

But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Java: :This question already has answers here:                                                            How do I create a file and write to it?                                (35 answers)                            Closed 8 years ago.I'm trying to write a program that writes a listing of things to a *.txt file, and everything appears to be all good and well but nothing is written in the txt file. Any help is appreciated. I won't post my code on here because it's only a small fraction, but I'm using a formatter in the form Formatter fileMaker = new Formatter(\"file.txt\"); and then I would do something like fileMaker.format(%s, String str); but nothing turns up in the file? Thanks for the help.   Hopefully this little bit might help, maybe I'm doing something wrong that I don't see, but I declared it as private static Formatter fileMaker; in the class and then I implement it like below.fileMaker.format(\"%s%d\\n\", \"#flightCount\", flights2.size());    for(int i=0; i<flights2.size(); i++){        fileMaker.format(\"%s %s%s%d%d %d \", \"#newFlight\", flights2.get(i).getSourceAirport(), flights2.get(i).getDestinationAirport(),                flights2.get(i).getTakeoffTime(), flights2.get(i).getLandingTime(), flights2.get(i).getCapacity());    }\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
