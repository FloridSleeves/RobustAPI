That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: writing a file in directory using printwriter in java: :file is not creating in my workspace or in any folder, can any one suggect specify a directory and also have to use \"UTF-8\"PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"twitterData_\"+currDate+\".txt\", \"UTF-8\");            writer.println(\"TweetId,UserScreenName,Tweet,TimeStamp\");\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
