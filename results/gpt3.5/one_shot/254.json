In this example, a buffer of size 1024 is used. The while loop continues until either the total number of bytes read reaches 2936000 or the end of the input stream is reached. The bytesRead variable stores the number of bytes read in each iteration, and the os.write() method writes the bytes to the output stream. The totalBytesRead variable keeps track of the total number of bytes read so far. Finally, the output stream is flushed and closed, and the input stream is closed."

The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Java copy part of InputStream to OutputStream: :I have a file with 3236000 bytes and I want to read 2936000 from start and write to an OutputStreamInputStream is = new FileInputStream(file1);OutputStream os = new FileOutputStream(file2);AFunctionToCopy(is,os,0,2936000); /* a function or sourcecode to write input stream 0to2936000 bytes */I can read and write byte by byte, but it's to slow (i think) from buffered readingHow can do I copy it?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
