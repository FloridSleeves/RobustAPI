The request parameters are usually set by the client when making the request. However, you can use a workaround by using a framework or library that provides a wrapper around the HttpServletRequest object, such as Spring MVC or Apache Struts. These frameworks provide methods to set request parameters."

Can you help me with this?\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Map.get\n<<<code>>>: import java.util.HashMap;import java.util.Map;Map<String, Integer> freq = new HashMap<String, Integer>();Integer count = freq.get(word);if (count == null) {freq.put(word, 1);}else {freq.put(word, count + 1);}\n<<<explanation>>>: If you look at the API for Map, get operations usually return null when the map does not contain the requested element. Note that this will make a solution.\nQuestion: How to set a parameter in a HttpServletRequest?: :I am using a javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest to implement a web application.I have no problem to get the parameter of a request using the getParameter method.
