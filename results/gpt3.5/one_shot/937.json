It then iterates over the first five bytes (or less if the string is shorter) and sums up their values. This can be used as a simple hash function for strings. However, keep in mind that this hash function may not be very robust and may not distribute the hash values evenly. It is recommended to use a more sophisticated hash function like the ones provided by the Java standard library (e.g., hashCode() method of the String class) or consider using a hashing algorithm like MD5 or SHA-256 for better results."

And I was thinking it might be a good idea to sum up the unicode values for the first five characters in the string (assuming it has five, otherwise stop where it ends).  Would that be a good idea, or is it a bad one?I am doing this in Java, but I wouldn't imagine that would make much of a difference.\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:"
