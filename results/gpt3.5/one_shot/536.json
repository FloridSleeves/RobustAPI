I have a method called endOfTurn which is called when the player wants to finish their turn, It sets the 'currentPlayerTurn' field to the next player in the Map. However once I reach the end of my map i want it to go back to the first player in the map and go round again and again. Is there a way of doing this? Also yes the players data structure does need to be a map!public class Game {private Map<String,Player> players;private Player currentPlayerTurn;public boolean EndOfTurn(Player currentPlayerTurn) {    //need to set this.currentPlayerTurn to the next player in the Map}I have looked into using an iterator but this doesnt seem to have a reset function or a 'loop around' mode. Any ideas?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
