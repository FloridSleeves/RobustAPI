Then, you can pass this PrintWriter object to the Thread.dumpStack() method to write the call stack to the file. Finally, remember to close the PrintWriter to ensure that all the data is flushed and the file is properly closed."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Can I copy thread.dumpstack() output to file: :I am using jdk1.4 so I have to use thread.dumpstack() method to print call stack and I want all the dump into file,Is there any way to do it?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
