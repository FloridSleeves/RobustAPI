We then use the createNewFile() method to create the file. If the file is successfully created, we print \"File created: \" followed by the file name. If the file already exists, we print \"File already exists.\". If an error occurs during the file creation process, we print \"An error occurred.\" and the stack trace of the exception."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: How to create a txt file in Java?: :I'm just want a program to register a user and then create a txt file to store there the information. I know it has to be with createNewFile method but I do not know how to use it. I'd try this in my code:import java.util.*;public class File{public static void main(String args[]){    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);byte option=0;    do{        System.out.println(\"\\nMENU:\\n\");        System.out.println(\"0.-EXIT\");        System.out.println(\"1.-REGISTER USER\");        System.out.println(\"\\nPLEASE ENTER YOUR CHOICE:\");        option = sc.nextByte();    }while(option!=0);}//main}//File\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
