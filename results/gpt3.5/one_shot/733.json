To fix this, you should create the PrintWriter object outside the loop and close it after the loop is finished. This way, all the random numbers will be written to the file."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: I'm trying to write a program that adds random numbers 0-1000 to a text file: :The user chooses the file name and the number of random numbers. As of now, the program only saves the last random number to the text filepublic static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException, UnsupportedEncodingException {    Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);    System.out.println(\"Enter a filename:\");    String filename = scan.nextLine();    System.out.println(\"Enter a positive Integer:\");    int number = scan.nextInt();    for (int i=0; i<number;i++){        Random rand= new Random();        int random = rand.nextInt(1001);        PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter (filename, \"UTF-8\");        writer.println(random);        writer.close();         System.out.println(random);    }    }\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
