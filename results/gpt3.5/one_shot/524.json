Here's an example:\n\n@Entity\npublic class A {\n    // fields\n\n    @OneToMany\n    @OrderBy(\"createdAt ASC\")\n    private List<B> b;\n\n    // getters and setters\n}\n\nIn this example, the \"b\" collection will be ordered by the \"createdAt\" field in ascending order. So when a new entry is added, the oldest one will be at the beginning of the list and can be easily removed.\n\nNote that the \"createdAt\" field should be present in the \"B\" entity and should have a proper value assigned when a new entry is created.\n\n<<<explanation>>>: By using the @OrderBy annotation with the \"createdAt\" field, you can ensure that the collection is always ordered by the creation date. This way, when a new entry is added, the oldest one will be at the beginning of the list and can be easily removed."

Try to just use the value of the foreach inside the loop.\nQuestion: Limit the size of a collection in JPA: :Say I have an entity like this@EntityClass A{//fields@OnetomanySet<B> b; // }Now, how do I limit the number of 'B's in the collection in such a way that, when there is a new entry in the collection, the oldest one is removed, some thing like removeEldestEntry we have in a LinkedHashMap.I am using MySQL 5.5 DB with Hibernate. Thanks in advance.EDITMy goal is not to have more than N number of entries in that table at any point of time. One solution I have is to use a Set and schedule a job to remove the older entries. But I find it dirty. I am looking for a cleaner solution.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
