That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Reading from a file?: :Please help me to do such a thing, let's say we have a text file, test.txt, about similar to this:hello hello hello<link1>http://stackoverflow.com<link1>The first line of text, and the second link enclosed in the <link1>. I am printing the contents of the file as follows: if(myName.equals(name)){                        InputStreamReader reader  = null;                        try{                            File file =  new File(\"C:\\\\Users\\\\\u0432\u0430\u043d\u044f\\\\Desktop\\\\asksearch\\\\\" + list[i]);                            reader =  new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream(file), \"UTF-8\");                            int b;                            PrintWriter wr =   response.getWriter();                            wr.print(\"<html>\");                            wr.print(\"<head>\");                            wr.print(\"<title>HelloWorld</title>\");                            wr.print(\"<meta http-equiv=\\\"Content-Type\\\" content=\\\"text/html; charset=utf-8\\\">\");                            wr.print(\"<body>\");                            wr.write(\"<div>\");                            while((b = reader.read()) != -1) {                                wr.write((char) b );                            }                            wr.write(\"</div>\");                            wr.write(\"<hr>\");                            wr.print(\"</body>\");                            wr.print(\"</html>\");                            wr.close();                        }Just a piece of code:while((b = reader.read()) != -1) {   writer.write((char) b);}You want to display, the first line of the file itself, and the second line of the file separatelyPrintWriter writer = response.getWriter();writer.print(\"<html>\");writer.print(\"<head>\");writer.print(\"<title>HelloWorld</title>\");writer.print(\"<body>\");writer.write(\"<div>\");// then the first linewriter.write(\"</div>\");writer.write(\"<div>\");// then the second linewriter.write(\"</div>\");writer.print(\"</body>\");writer.print(\"</html>\");\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
