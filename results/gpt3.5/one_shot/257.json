You can do this by adding the following Maven dependency to your pom.xml file:\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>org.apache.poi</groupId>\n    <artifactId>poi</artifactId>\n    <version>4.1.2</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n\n2. Use the following code to read the Excel file and retrieve the data:\n\n```java\nimport org.apache.poi.ss.usermodel.*;\n\npublic class ExcelParser {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        try {\n            // Load the Excel file\n            Workbook workbook = WorkbookFactory.create(new File(\"path/to/your/excel/file.xlsx\"));\n\n            // Get the first sheet\n            Sheet sheet = workbook.getSheetAt(0);\n\n            // Iterate over the rows\n            Iterator<Row> rowIterator = sheet.iterator();\n            while (rowIterator.hasNext()) {\n                Row row = rowIterator.next();\n\n                // Iterate over the cells in the row\n                Iterator<Cell> cellIterator = row.cellIterator();\n                while (cellIterator.hasNext()) {\n                    Cell cell = cellIterator.next();\n\n                    // Get the cell value based on its type\n                    switch (cell.getCellType()) {\n                        case STRING:\n                            String value = cell.getStringCellValue();\n                            // Do something with the value\n                            break;\n                        case NUMERIC:\n                            double numericValue = cell.getNumericCellValue();\n                            // Do something with the numeric value\n                            break;\n                        // Handle other cell types as needed\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n\n            // Close the workbook\n            workbook.close();\n        } catch (IOException | InvalidFormatException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n3. Once you have retrieved the data from the Excel file, you can link it to your objects and perform the necessary calculations.\n\n4. For the interactive GUI, you can use a Java GUI framework like Swing or JavaFX to display the results and provide user interaction.\n\n<<<explanation>>>: Apache POI is a popular Java API for working with Microsoft Office documents, including Excel spreadsheets. It provides classes and methods to read, write, and manipulate Excel files. In the code example above, we use Apache POI to read the Excel file and retrieve the data from each cell. You can then use this data to link it to your objects and perform calculations. For the interactive GUI, you can use a Java GUI framework like Swing or JavaFX to display the results and provide user interaction."
