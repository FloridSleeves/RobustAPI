That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: How to Clear a text file without deleting it?: :I am wondering what the best way to clear a file is. I know that java automatically creates a file with f = new Formatter(\"jibberish.txt\");  s = new Scanner(\"jibberish.txt\");if none already exists. But what if one exists and I want to clear it every time I run the program? That is what I am wondering: to say it again how do I clear a file that already exists to just be blank? Here is what I was thinking: public void clearFile(){    //go through and do this every time in order to delete previous crap    while(s.hasNext()){        f.format(\" \");    }} \nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
