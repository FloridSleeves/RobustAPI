You need to initialize it with the appropriate size before assigning values to its elements. Additionally, you should close the PrintWriter after writing to the file and print the exception stack trace to help identify the cause of the error."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: NullPointerException Error in program that writes to file: :I am trying to print strings into a file. What have I done wrong and it always gives me a NullPointException? I believe my exceptions catch something or an argument is needed and I dont enter it. But where?I have writen this code, that contains the main function.EDIT: Getting error in the second line from the bottom some.items[0]=\"Testing One!\";.import java.io.*;public class StringPrinter {            public String[] items;            public File file;            public StringPrinter(String fileName){                    file = new File(fileName);}            public void toFile(){                    try{                        PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(file, false));                            for (String st:items){                                     pw.println(st);                            }                    }                    catch(Exception exception){}            }    public static void main(String args[]){        StringPrinter some=new StringPrinter(\"Workyou.txt\");        some.items[0]=\"Testing One!\";        some.items[1]=\"Testing Two!\";        some.toFile();    }}\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
