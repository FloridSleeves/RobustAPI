It sends a POST request with the user data to the login URL, and if the response code is 200 (OK), it downloads the file by reading the input stream and writing it to a file output stream. Make sure to replace \"https://example.com/login\" with the actual login URL, \"myUsername\" and \"myPassword\" with the actual username and password, and \"path/to/save/file.csv\" with the actual path to save the downloaded file."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Create a Session in Java Application: :There is this certain website that I'm trying to get a csv file from but it requires a user to login first before downloading. I've tried logging in using Internet Explorer and download using that session but it didn't work. So I'm guessing I need to POST user data to the web, get an answer and download the file.How can I create a session wtih Java and download the file? Thank you in advance.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
