It specifies the URL pattern(s) that will invoke the servlet when requested by a client.\n<<<explanation>>>: When a client sends a request to a specific URL pattern, the servlet container uses the <servlet-mapping> element to determine which servlet should handle the request. The <servlet-mapping> element contains two sub-elements: <servlet-name> and <url-pattern>. The <servlet-name> element specifies the name of the servlet, and the <url-pattern> element specifies the URL pattern(s) that will invoke the servlet. Multiple URL patterns can be specified for a single servlet."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: what is the role of <servlet-mapping> in the web.xml?: :This question already has answers here:                                                            Closed 12 years ago.Possible Duplicate:Can anyone explain servlet mapping? i want above questions theory answer.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
