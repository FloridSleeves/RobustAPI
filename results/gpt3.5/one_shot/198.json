Finally, we convert the textBuilder to a string and print the parsed text."

The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: How to parse multiple, consecutive xml files in one document?: :I have a big text file that is a sequence of XML-valid documents that looks something like this:<DOC>   <TEXT> ... </TEXT>    ...</DOC><DOC>    <TEXT> ... </TEXT>    ...</DOC>etc. There is no <?xml version=\"1.0\">, the <DOC></DOC> delimits each separate xml. What's the best way to parse this in Java and get the values under <TEXT> in each <DOC>?If I pass the whole thing to a DocumentBuilder, I get an error saying the document is not well formed. Is there a better solution than simply traversing through, a building a string for each <DOC>?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
