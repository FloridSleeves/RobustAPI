Add the Apache CXF library to your project's dependencies.\n\n2. Use the following code to parse the MTOM/XOP SOAP response:\n\nimport org.apache.cxf.attachment.AttachmentDeserializer;\nimport org.apache.cxf.message.Attachment;\nimport org.apache.cxf.message.Message;\nimport org.apache.cxf.message.MessageImpl;\nimport org.apache.cxf.phase.PhaseInterceptorChain;\nimport org.apache.cxf.staxutils.StaxUtils;\n\n// Assuming you have the MTOM/XOP SOAP response in an InputStream called responseInputStream\nInputStream responseInputStream = ...;\n\n// Create a CXF Message object\nMessage message = new MessageImpl();\n\n// Set the input stream as the content of the message\nmessage.setContent(InputStream.class, responseInputStream);\n\n// Set the content type of the message\nmessage.put(Message.CONTENT_TYPE, \"multipart/related\");\n\n// Get the interceptor chain\nPhaseInterceptorChain chain = PhaseInterceptorChain.getCurrentMessage();\n\n// Create an AttachmentDeserializer\nAttachmentDeserializer attachmentDeserializer = new AttachmentDeserializer(message);\n\n// Deserialize the attachments\nList<Attachment> attachments = attachmentDeserializer.getAttachments();\n\n// Iterate over the attachments and process them as needed\nfor (Attachment attachment : attachments) {\n    // Process the attachment\n    // ...\n}\n\n// Get the SOAP body content\nXMLStreamReader reader = StaxUtils.createXMLStreamReader(responseInputStream);\nStaxUtils.toNextElement(reader); // Move to the SOAP body element\nString soapBodyContent = StaxUtils.readElementText(reader);\n\n// Close the input stream\nresponseInputStream.close();\n\n// Process the SOAP body content as needed\n// ...\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The code above uses the Apache CXF library to parse MTOM/XOP SOAP responses. It creates a CXF Message object and sets the MTOM/XOP SOAP response as the content of the message. It then uses an AttachmentDeserializer to deserialize the attachments and process them as needed. Finally, it uses StaxUtils to read the SOAP body content and process it as needed."

The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: How to parse XOP/MTOM SOAP response using java?: :I just want to know, is there any simple way for parsing  MTOM/XOP SOAP response. The problem is that I use plain HTTP to send soap message and javax.xml for parsing response. But some services responds me with mulipart/related and it    requires much more complex logic to parse it (performance matters). So I wonder may I somehow take advantage of apache cxf, apache axiom or any other library for parsing MTOM/XOP SOAP response?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
