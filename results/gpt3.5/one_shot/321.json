The for-each loop in Java was designed to simplify the iteration over collections by abstracting away the details of indexing and iteration variables. \n\nIn the first two options, the iteration variable (i or y) is explicitly managed by the programmer, allowing for more control over its value. However, this goes against the simplicity and readability goals of the for-each loop.\n\nThe third option you proposed introduces a new syntax that combines the benefits of both options, but it also adds complexity and potential confusion. It would require the language to distinguish between two different foreach syntaxes, which could lead to ambiguity and make the code harder to understand.\n\nAdditionally, the third option assumes that the Iterable<E> has a specific order associated with it, which is not always the case. Many objects that implement Iterable<E> do not have a defined order, such as sets or maps. Introducing a new syntax that assumes order could lead to incorrect assumptions and errors in code.\n\nOverall, the decision to not include the third syntax in Java was likely made to prioritize simplicity, readability, and consistency in the language."

Try to just use the value of the foreach inside the loop.\nQuestion: Java why does no third syntax for for (each) loops exist?: :I know that currently there are two approaches to loop over an List. But let's complicate it a bit more, consider:You iterate over List<E> list.You want to keep track of an int y on every iteration.There exists a function process(E elem, int y) that processes an item.Option 1:for (int i = 0, y = 0; i < list.size(); i++, y++) {    process(list.get(i), y);}which actually just isfor (int i = 0; i < list.size(); i++) {    process(list.get(i), i);}Option 2:int y = 0;for (E elem : list) {    process(elem, y);    y++;}which can be rewritten toint y = 0;for (E elem : list) {    process(elem, y++);}However why does the following not exist? What are the objections to it not existing?Option 3:for (int y = 0; E elem : list; y++) {    process(elem, y);}Two arguments to have this construct:Both foreach syntaxes are distinguishableMany objects implement Iterable<E>, but have no for counterpart. This happens when an Iterable<E> has no order associated with it for example.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
