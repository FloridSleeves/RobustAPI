You can check if the Reader supports mark and reset operations by calling the markSupported() method. If it returns true, you can safely call reset(). If it returns false, you will need to find an alternative solution, such as creating a new Reader instance or using a different approach to achieve your desired result."

The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Why do I get exception error while trying to reset Reader to 0 position?: :I'm trying to read a webpage using following code :URL url = new URL(\"somewebsitecomeshere\");                URLConnection c = url.openConnection();                if(getHttpResponseCode(c) == 200)                {                    if (isContentValid(c))//accept html/xml only!                    {                        InputStream is = c.getInputStream();                        Reader r = new InputStreamReader(is);                        System.out.println(r.toString());                                                //after commenting this everything works great!                        setHTMLString(getStringFromReader(r));                        System.out.println(getHTMLString());                        ParserDelegator parser = new ParserDelegator();                        parser.parse(r, new Parser(url), true);                        r.close();                        is.close();                        try {                            Thread.sleep(500);                        } catch (InterruptedException e) {                            // TODO Auto-generated catch block                            e.printStackTrace();                        }                    }                    else                        log(\"content is not valid!\");                }                else                {                    System.out.println(\"ERROR\" + c.getContentType() + c.getURL());                }//---------------------------------------------------    private String getStringFromReader(Reader reader) throws IOException {          char[] arr = new char[8*1024]; // 8K at a time          StringBuffer buf = new StringBuffer();          int numChars;          while ((numChars = reader.read(arr, 0, arr.length)) > 0) {              buf.append(arr, 0, numChars);          }              //Reset position to 0          reader.reset();          return buf.toString();            }if try to read string using getStringFromReader() the rest of the code will be ignored due to changing position of Reader to EOF so I tried to reset the position to 0 but I got the following error :java.io.IOException: reset() not supported    at java.io.Reader.reset(Unknown Source)    at sample.getStringFromReader(Spider.java:248)    at default(sample.java:286)    at default.main(sample.java:130)How can I reset the Reader position to 0?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
