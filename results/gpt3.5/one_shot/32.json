Therefore, you need to initialize the CheckBox variables inside the onCreate() method after calling setContentView()."

I am confused how does it work? why doesn't it give error just like we get in java code? and most importantly, how does environment decide to which component it needs to invoke? I understand the process of id generation is automated, which gets added to R.java For instance, if we have same IDs, say \"image1\" in two XMLs, say \"layout1\" & \"layout2\". but in R.java it won't have 2 IDs. that means at a time it will reference only 1 component. In case we have to use 2 XMLs in an Activity, one as activity.setcontentview(layout1) and another as a PopupWindow.setContentView(layout2). What will happen in such case?\nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Activity.setContentView\n<<<code>>>: @Override\npublic void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n    Button myButton = (Button) findViewById(R.id.my_button);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You can findViewById of the current view hierarchy set to the activity. You cannot have same id for the view's in the same view tree. (must be unique).\nQuestion: I would like to set my variables at the top of my class instead of in the method: :I can't seem to tackle this confusing problem, I have lots and lots of things that I would like to add at the top of my class to help cut down on clutter.Since multiple methods use these checkbox variables.I would like to have everything at the top directly under the opening bracket.Here's what works, but not what I want.:public class MyClass extends Activity implements View.OnClickListener {    //leaving out most code like onCreate. Just pretend it's there.    public void checkboth(View view) {        CheckBox cb1 = (CheckBox) findViewById(R.id.cb1);        CheckBox cb2 = (CheckBox) findViewById(R.id.cb2);            cb1.setchecked(true);            cb2.setchecked(true);    }    @Override    public void onClick(View v) {    }}But for the life of me I can't figure out why I can't do this:public class MyClass extends Activity implements View.OnClickListener {CheckBox cb1 = (CheckBox) findViewById(R.id.cb1);CheckBox cb2 = (CheckBox) findViewById(R.id.cb2);    //leaving out most code like onCreate. Just pretend it's there.    public void checkboth(View view) {                    cb1.setchecked(true);        cb2.setchecked(true);    }    @Override    public void onClick(View v) {    }}\nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer:"
