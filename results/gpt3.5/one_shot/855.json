Here's an example of how you can read the header and file entries:\n\ntry (DataInputStream dis = new DataInputStream(new FileInputStream(your_file))) {\n    // Read the header\n    byte[] headerBytes = new byte[3];\n    dis.readFully(headerBytes);\n    String header = new String(headerBytes);\n    byte dummyByte = dis.readByte();\n    int numFiles = dis.readByte();\n\n    // Read each file entry\n    for (int i = 0; i < numFiles; i++) {\n        byte dummyByte2 = dis.readByte();\n        byte[] fileNameBytes = new byte[12];\n        dis.readFully(fileNameBytes);\n        String fileName = new String(fileNameBytes);\n        byte dummyByte3 = dis.readByte();\n        byte[] offsetBytes = new byte[3];\n        dis.readFully(offsetBytes);\n        int offset = ByteBuffer.wrap(offsetBytes).order(ByteOrder.LITTLE_ENDIAN).getInt();\n\n        // Process the file entry here\n    }\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The DataInputStream class allows you to read data from an input stream in a structured way. You can use its various read methods to read different types of data, such as bytes, chars, ints, etc. In this case, you can use readFully to read a specific number of bytes into a byte array, and then convert it to the desired data type if needed."

The last 6 bytes in my files contain crucial information when writing the files back. I need to write my original files, and then append the last 6 bytes elsewhere. Any guidance? Thanks\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: RandomAccessFile.read\n<<<code>>>: RandomAccessFile randomAccessFile = new RandomAccessFile(your_file, \"r\");randomAccessFile.seek(your_file.length() - n);try{randomAccessFile.read(byteArray, 0, n);} catch(IOException e) {e.printStackTrace();} \n<<<explanation>>>: You have to do it by using RandomAccessFile. Instances of this class support both reading and writing to a random access file. A random access file behaves like a large array of bytes stored in the file system. \nQuestion: Resource file format processing in Java: :I am trying to implement a processor for a specific resource archive file format in Java. The format has a Header comprised of a three-char description, a dummy byte, plus a byte indicating the number of files. Then each file has an entry consisting of a dummy byte, a twelve-char string describing the file name, a dummy byte, and an offset declared in a three-byte array. What would be the proper class for reading this kind of structure? I have tried RandomAccessFile but it does not allow to read arrays of data, e.g. I can only read three chars by calling readChar() three times, etc.Of course I can extend RandomAccessFile to do what I want but there's got to be a proper out-of-the-box class to do this kind of processing isn't it?This is my reader for the header in C#:protected override void ReadHeader(){    Header = new string(this.BinaryReader.ReadChars(3));    byte dummy = this.BinaryReader.ReadByte();    NFiles = this.BinaryReader.ReadByte();}\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:"
