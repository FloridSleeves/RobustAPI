In this example, we assume you have a Vector called \"data\" containing your data and a Vector called \"columnNames\" containing your column names. You can then create a DefaultTableModel with these vectors and set it to the JTable. Finally, you can add the JTable to your GUI."

Can you help me with this?\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Map.get\n<<<code>>>: import java.util.HashMap;import java.util.Map;Map<String, Integer> freq = new HashMap<String, Integer>();Integer count = freq.get(word);if (count == null) {freq.put(word, 1);}else {freq.put(word, count + 1);}\n<<<explanation>>>: If you look at the API for Map, get operations usually return null when the map does not contain the requested element. Note that this will make a solution.\nQuestion: using JTables with netbeans 6.1 aka Matisse: :Before you answer: Yes I have read the jtable tutorial over at Sun. No, it did not help me. Yes, I am a dolt. Please don't answer with a reference to that document. What I am specifically interested in is how to dynamically add rows and columns to my Jtable via the Netbeans IDE. I already have an object that contains a hashmap with my data. I can't figure out where or what object I should be passing that object to. Thanks for your time! I have a vector that contains a series (of length l) of objects (each one corresponding to a row). How do I get that vector object to display on the JTable?\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:"
