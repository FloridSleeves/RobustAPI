It keeps track of the count of each choice (A and B) and ensures that there is an even split among the two choices by checking if the count of either choice has reached half of the total items. If not, it randomly selects a choice and increments the corresponding count. If one of the choices has reached half of the total items, it fills the remaining items with the other choice."

Try to just use the value of the foreach inside the loop.\nQuestion: Creating an even amount of randomness in an array: :Let's say that you have an arbitrarily large sized two-dimensional array with an even amount of items in it. Let's also assume for clarity that you can only choose between two things to put as a given item in the array. How would you go about putting a random choice at a given index in the array but once the array is filled you have an even split among the two choices?If there are any answers with code, Java is preferred but other languages are fine as well.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
