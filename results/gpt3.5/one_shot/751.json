Here is an example:\n\nStringWriter stringWriter = new StringWriter();\nPrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(stringWriter);\nprintWriter.write(\"Hello World\");\nprintWriter.flush();\nString response = stringWriter.toString();\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The StringWriter class is a character stream that collects its output in a string buffer, which can be used to construct a string. In this example, we create a StringWriter object and pass it to the PrintWriter constructor. We then write the desired text to the PrintWriter and flush it to ensure that all the data is written. Finally, we retrieve the string representation of the StringWriter using the toString() method."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Return a text string as the response struts2: :hello all i got a tutorial for getting string/text as response from struts2 action class. it is from struts2 documentation and the link is tutorial. It is working. But my question is the StringBufferInputstream calss is deprecated. So can we use this class. if no so what is alternate for this. \nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
