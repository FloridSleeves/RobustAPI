However, it is important to note that some programs, like Excel or Word, may update the file's last modified time even if no changes were made. This is because these programs may update metadata or other information related to the file. If you want to monitor actual changes to the file's content, you may need to compare the file's contents before and after it is closed."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: get file modification time: :i want to write a code for monitoring file changes and reacting to changes.so i write a TimerTask to periodically check the modification of filebut i have a problem:when file is open by other programs such as excel or word and i'm closing the filewithout any changes,value  File.lastModified() is changing.i am also trying to get modification date by running dir shell script, it's work fine butit only has minute accuracy!can any one help me?thanks\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
