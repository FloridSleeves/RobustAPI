You need to create a new PrintWriter object for the second file and use the write() method to write the uppercase information to the file. Additionally, you should close the PrintWriter object after writing to ensure that the changes are saved."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Reading and Writing text file?: :I'm suppose to write a program in which we ask the user for 2 files the first file is for reading and the second for writingthe first one we are suppose to read the file and then copy the info switch it all to uppercase and save it to the second fileI cant get it to write on the second part any help?public class FileConverter {public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException{    Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);    System.out.println(\"Enter the filename for the first file\");    String filename = keyboard.nextLine();    File file = new File(filename);    Scanner inputFile = new Scanner (file);    while(inputFile.hasNext())    {        String fileinfo = inputFile.nextLine();        String uppercaseinfo1 = fileinfo.toUpperCase();    }    System.out.print(\"Enter the filename \"                + \"for the second file\");    filename = keyboard.nextLine();    PrintWriter outputFile = new PrintWriter(file);    while(inputFile.hasNext())        {            outputFile.println();        }}}\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
