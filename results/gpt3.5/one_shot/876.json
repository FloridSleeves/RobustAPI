In the selection string, you need to use the placeholder \"?\" to represent the value you want to search for. Then, in the selection arguments, you need to provide the actual value to be substituted for the placeholder.\n\nIn your case, you want to search for formulas whose name contains the query string. So, you need to use the \"LIKE\" operator in the selection string and provide the query string as the selection argument.\n\nAdditionally, you need to concatenate the \"%\" wildcard characters before and after the query string in the selection argument to perform a partial match.\n\nFinally, make sure to use the same SQLiteDatabase instance (db) for both beginning and ending the transaction.\n\nI have updated the code to fix these issues."
