You can use nested loops to iterate through the array and use the PrintWriter's write method to write each element to the file. Additionally, you can use the PrintWriter's println method to add a new line after each row of the array. Finally, make sure to close the PrintWriter after writing to the file."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: I am trying to print a 2D array to a file: :I want to print 2D array to txt file on my desktop. It is important, that the output is formatted in way, that is in code, because it represents rows and seats.Code:package vaja15;import java.util.*;import java.io.PrintWriter;import java.io.File;import java.io.FileNotFoundException;public class Vaja15 {    public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException     {        System.out.println(\"Vnesi velikost dvorane (vrste/sedezi):  \");        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);        Random r  = new Random();        int vrst = sc.nextInt();        int sedezev = sc.nextInt();         int [][] dvorana  = new int [vrst][sedezev];        File  file = new File (\"C:/users/mr/desktop/dvorana.txt\");        for(int i = 0; i<dvorana.length; i++)        {            System.out.println();            for (int j = 0; j<dvorana.length; j++)            {                dvorana [i][j] = r.nextInt(3);                  System.out.print(dvorana[i][j]);                PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(file);                out.println(dvorana[i][j]);                out.close();            }           }     } }\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
