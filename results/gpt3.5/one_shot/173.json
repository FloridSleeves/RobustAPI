The `concat()` method returns a new string and does not modify the original string. So, you need to assign the concatenated string back to `ret` like `ret = ret.concat(t)`. Additionally, you can use the `readLine()` method of `BufferedReader` to read the response line by line until it returns null."

The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Try/catch block with a while statement, used to handle socket data, does not continue. No obvious errors (I think): :This is my main class - Main.java. Used to control requester but added for completeness.import java.io.IOException;import HtmlRequester.Requester;public class Main {public static void main(String[] args) {    Requester rq = new Requester(\"www.google.co.za\", 80);    try {        rq.htmlRequest();    } catch (IOException e) {        e.printStackTrace();        System.err.println(\"Connection failed.\");        System.exit(-1);    }}}This is requester.java, edited for shortness.package HtmlRequester;import java.net.*;import java.io.*;public class Requester{    Socket httpSocket = null;    PrintWriter out = null;    BufferedReader in = null;    String server;    int port;public void setAttributes(String server, int port){    this.server = server;    this.port = port;}public String htmlRequest(String server, int port) throws IOException{    try {        httpSocket = new Socket(InetAddress.getByName(server), port);        out = new PrintWriter(httpSocket.getOutputStream(), true);        in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(                httpSocket.getInputStream()));    } catch (UnknownHostException e) {        System.err.println(\"Don't know about host: \" + server);        System.exit(-1);    } catch (IOException e) {        System.err.println(\"Couldn't get I/O for \"                           + \"the connection to: \" + server + \"on port \" + port);        System.exit(-1);    }    finally{        System.out.println(\"Successful connection.\");    }    out.println(compileRequestText());    out.println(\"\");    String t;    String ret = \"\";    System.out.println(\"wait...\");    try {        while((t = in.readLine()) != null)        {        ret.concat(t);        System.out.println(t);        }        System.out.println(\"done\");    }    catch(SocketException e)    {        System.err.println(\"Socket Exception :(\");    }    System.out.println(\"Succesful data transfer.\");    out.close();    in.close();    httpSocket.close();    return ret;}private String compileRequestText(){    String ret = \"GET / HTTP/1.1\";    return ret;}}What happens is that the second try-catch block in Request.java, the block that contains:while((t = in.readLine()) != null)Will execute, and the response from server is successfully displayed. However, after the response is displayed, the loop will stop executing, the code does not move ahead to the finally block. The program does not seem to continue after that while loop. Anyone have any idea why?i.e.,             System.out.println(\"done\");is never reached, with no exceptions or compiler errors being thrown.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
