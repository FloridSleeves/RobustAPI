The code snippet provided demonstrates how to seek to a specific byte offset in the file, read a specific number of bytes into a buffer, and convert the buffer into a String. This can be used as a starting point for implementing binary search in a sorted text file. As for memory-mapping the file, Java provides the FileChannel class which can be used to map a region of a file directly into memory. This can be an efficient way to perform random access reads on large files, but it requires careful management of memory resources."

The last 6 bytes in my files contain crucial information when writing the files back. I need to write my original files, and then append the last 6 bytes elsewhere. Any guidance? Thanks\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: RandomAccessFile.read\n<<<code>>>: RandomAccessFile randomAccessFile = new RandomAccessFile(your_file, \"r\");randomAccessFile.seek(your_file.length() - n);try{randomAccessFile.read(byteArray, 0, n);} catch(IOException e) {e.printStackTrace();} \n<<<explanation>>>: You have to do it by using RandomAccessFile. Instances of this class support both reading and writing to a random access file. A random access file behaves like a large array of bytes stored in the file system. \nQuestion: Binary search in a sorted (memory-mapped ?) file in Java: :I am struggling to port a Perl program to Java, and learning Java as I go. A central component of the original program is a Perl module that does string prefix lookups in a +500 GB sorted text file using binary search (essentially, \"seek\" to a byte offset in the middle of the file, backtrack to nearest newline, compare line prefix with the search string, \"seek\" to half/double that byte offset, repeat until found...)I have experimented with several database solutions but found that nothing beats this in sheer lookup speed with data sets of this size. Do you know of any existing Java library that implements such functionality? Failing that, could you point me to some idiomatic example code that does random access reads in text files?Alternatively, I am not familiar with the new (?) Java I/O libraries but would it be an option to memory-map the 500 GB text file (I'm on a 64-bit machine with memory to spare) and do binary search on the memory-mapped byte array? I would be very interested to hear any experiences you have to share about this and similar problems.\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:"
