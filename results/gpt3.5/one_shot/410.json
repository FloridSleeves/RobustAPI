It does not work for Map because Map does not have a defined order of elements like List does. If you want to randomize the order of entries in a Map, you can convert it to a List of Map.Entry objects, shuffle the list using Collections.shuffle, and then convert it back to a Map if needed."

I have this working, and now I'm looking at expanding it to hold results. At the moment I read all the teams into a list. and use Collections.rotate to rotate the list in order to randomize the fixtures.I was thinking of using a Map to hold the team and number of wins, however rotate doesn't appear to work for map. Is there a similar function that I'm missing, or something that I have overlooked?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
