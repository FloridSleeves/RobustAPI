The read method will block until data is available or the end of the stream is reached. By reading in chunks, you can check if the read method returns -1, indicating the end of the stream, and break out of the loop. Additionally, you can catch the IOException that may be thrown if there is an error reading from the stream and handle it accordingly."

The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Java InputStream Locking: :I am using an InputStream to stream a file over the network. However if my network goes down the the process of reading the file the read method blocks and is never recovers if the network reappears. I was wondering how I should handle this case and should some exception not be thrown if the InputStream goes away. Code is like this. Url someUrl = new Url(\"http://somefile.com\");InputStream inputStream = someUrl.openStream();byte[] byteArray = new byte[];int size = 1024;inputStream.read(byteArray,0,size);So somewhere after calling read the network goes down and the read method blocks. How can i deal with this situation as the read doesn't seem to throw an exception. \nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
