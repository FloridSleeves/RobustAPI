To fix this, you need to create an instance of the Violin class using the syntax \"new ViolinGonzalezAP3().new Violin()\" and then access the methods and variables through that instance. Additionally, you need to change the method calls to use the instance of the Violin class, such as \"violinAmount[i].getNumberOfViolins()\" instead of \"Violin.getNumberOfViolins()\"."

But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Would anyone mind helping me trouble shoot my code, i am trying to import a class i made and get\" cannot resolve error\": :New to java and need some help. I am working with 2 files. One defines a class and all of it's methods and another constructs an instance of this class.
