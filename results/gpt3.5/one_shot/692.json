Writing refers to modifying or creating a new file.\n\nThe PrintWriter class is used for writing formatted text to a file. It is similar to FileWriter, but provides additional methods for formatting the output. Here is an example of how to use PrintWriter:\n\nimport java.io.*;\n\npublic class Example {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        try {\n            PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"output.txt\");\n            writer.println(\"This is line 1\");\n            writer.println(\"This is line 2\");\n            writer.close();\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nIn this example, we create a PrintWriter object and specify the file name \"output.txt\" as the destination. We then use the println method to write each line of text to the file. Finally, we close the PrintWriter to ensure that all data is written to the file.\n\nNote that PrintWriter automatically flushes the output buffer, so you don't need to explicitly call the flush method.\n\nYou can also use PrintWriter to write to the console or any other output stream by passing the appropriate OutputStream or Writer object to the constructor."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Reading a File versus Writing One: :This question is not specific question, but more a general question. For reading a file I know you can use Scanner and read it and then print it. However reading a file and then printing it in a new format, like double space, indents, basically any spacing issues, is that also considered reading it or is it writing it? From my understanding of what my teacher has taught me, is that writing overwrites the original document and replaces it. Also how does one use the PrintWriter command? I have never seen this before in my class nor have read about it in my textbook but its on my test according to my teacher. Could someone give an explanation and an example about it? I read this site http://www.caveofprogramming.com/frontpage/articles/java/java-file-reading-and-writing-files-in-java/ on writing files, but it uses FileWriter, which I'm assuming takes the place of scanner? Is that right?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
