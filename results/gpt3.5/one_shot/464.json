If the employee's salary is smaller than the current minSal, update minSal with the employee's salary. This way, you will find the minimum salary among all employees in the department."

My main function reads off a .txt file filled with employee names, salaries, departments, and positions. My Employee class is just getters and setters. An list of arraylists are made to represent the employees and I'm not sure how I would find the minimum salary of each of the departments. To find the maximum salary I did this in my department class.public class Department {    String dept;    List<Employee> employees;    double minSal;    double maxSal;    public void addEmployee(Employee emp){        maxSal = 0.0;        if (maxSal < emp.getSalary()) {            maxSal = emp.getSalary();        }but I'm not sure how to get the minimum salary. My idea was to get the salary of one of the employees from each department and use that as a starting point for if (minSal > emp.getSalary()) {    minSalary = emp.getSalary();}But I realized I had no idea what to do. Can I get some help with this?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
