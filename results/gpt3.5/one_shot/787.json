This will automatically add a line break after each string. Additionally, you can use the FileWriter constructor with the \"append\" parameter set to true, so that the new data is appended to the existing file instead of overwriting it."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: How do I work with adding things to files?: :So, I'm back again with yet another problem. ^_^This time, I'm working with a file management system in which I add the user's username and password when they enter it in the login screen window (not shown here. I want to write to a text file that stores the data on two seperate lines, but I don't know how to work it.    File termsOfAgreement = new File(gamePath + \"/terms.txt\");    try {        termsOfAgreement.createNewFile();    } catch (IOException exc) {        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, \"Cannot create files! :(\",\"Alas, something went wrong!\", JOptionPane.ERROR_MESSAGE);        System.exit(0);    }    String pathway = termsOfAgreement.getPath();    try {        this.writeToFile(pathway, \"username\", \"passcode\");    } catch (IOException exc) {        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, \"Cannot work with files! :(\",\"Alas, something went wrong!\", JOptionPane.ERROR_MESSAGE);        System.exit(0);    }}public void writeToFile(String filePath, String username, String passcode) throws IOException {    FileWriter filewriter = new FileWriter(filePath);    BufferedWriter bufferedwriter = new BufferedWriter(filewriter);    String[] credentials = {username, passcode};    String writtenStuffs = \"\";    for (String credit : credentials) {        writtenStuffs += credit + \"\\n\";    }    bufferedwriter.write(writtenStuffs);    bufferedwriter.close(); }}I made an array, but it didn't seem to help. I'm turning to Stack Overflow for help.Thanks in advance,:)\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
