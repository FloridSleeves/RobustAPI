Then, in your ServerListPingEvent, you can set the player count to the virtual count using the setOnlinePlayers(int onlinePlayers) method. Here's an example:\n\nint virtualPlayerCount = 100; // Set your desired virtual player count\n\n@EventHandler\npublic void onServerListPing(ServerListPingEvent event) {\n    event.setMaxPlayers(1000); // Set your desired virtual max player count\n    event.setOnlinePlayers(virtualPlayerCount); // Set the virtual player count\n}\n\nTo get the players via a query in your plugin, you can use the Bukkit.getServer().getOnlinePlayers() method to get a list of online players. Here's an example:\n\nList<Player> onlinePlayers = new ArrayList<>(Bukkit.getServer().getOnlinePlayers());\nint actualPlayerCount = onlinePlayers.size(); // Get the actual player count\n\nNote that the actual player count will be the real number of players currently online, while the virtual player count will be the number you set in the ServerListPingEvent."

I Thing to set a virtual number for the max Player Count I can use the Method setMaxPlayers(int mxPlayers) from the ServerListPing Event. But what about the online Players? And does it also work if I try to get the Players via a query in a plugin?Thank you for your help and sorry for my bad English ;)\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
