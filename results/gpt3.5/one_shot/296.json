Here's a possible approach:\n\n1. Create a shared array to store the sorted names.\n2. Create a counter variable to keep track of the number of threads that have finished sorting.\n3. In each thread, sort its assigned portion of the array.\n4. After sorting, synchronize on the shared array and merge the sorted portion into it.\n5. Increment the counter variable and check if all threads have finished sorting.\n6. If not all threads have finished, call wait() on the shared array to wait for other threads to finish.\n7. If all threads have finished, call notify() on the shared array to wake up any waiting threads.\n8. Repeat steps 4-7 until all threads have merged their sorted portions into the shared array.\n\nHere's an example code snippet to illustrate the idea:\n\n```java\npublic class SortThread extends Thread {\n    private String[] names;\n    private String[] sortedNames;\n    private String[] sharedArray;\n    private int startIndex;\n    private int endIndex;\n    private Object lock;\n    private int counter;\n\n    public SortThread(String[] names, String[] sharedArray, int startIndex, int endIndex, Object lock, int counter) {\n        this.names = names;\n        this.sharedArray = sharedArray;\n        this.startIndex = startIndex;\n        this.endIndex = endIndex;\n        this.lock = lock;\n        this.counter = counter;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void run() {\n        // Sort the assigned portion of the array\n        sortedNames = Arrays.copyOfRange(names, startIndex, endIndex);\n        Arrays.sort(sortedNames);\n\n        // Synchronize on the shared array and merge the sorted portion\n        synchronized (lock) {\n            mergeSortedNames();\n            counter++;\n\n            // Check if all threads have finished sorting\n            if (counter < sharedArray.length) {\n                try {\n                    // Wait for other threads to finish\n                    lock.wait();\n                } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n                    e.printStackTrace();\n                }\n            } else {\n                // Notify all waiting threads\n                lock.notifyAll();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    private void mergeSortedNames() {\n        // Merge the sorted portion into the shared array\n        System.arraycopy(sortedNames, 0, sharedArray, startIndex, sortedNames.length);\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Read names from file and store in an array\n\n        // Split the array into the desired number of threads\n\n        // Create a shared array to store the sorted names\n        String[] sortedNames = new String[names.length];\n\n        // Create an object for synchronization\n        Object lock = new Object();\n\n        // Create and start the threads\n        int counter = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i < numThreads; i++) {\n            int startIndex = i * portionSize;\n            int endIndex = (i == numThreads - 1) ? names.length : (i + 1) * portionSize;\n            SortThread thread = new SortThread(names, sortedNames, startIndex, endIndex, lock, counter);\n            thread.start();\n        }\n\n        // Wait for all threads to finish\n        synchronized (lock) {\n            try {\n                lock.wait();\n            } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n                e.printStackTrace();\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Merge the sorted portions into one array\n\n        // Print the sorted array\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, each thread sorts its assigned portion of the array and merges it into the shared array. The threads synchronize on the shared array using a lock object. The counter variable keeps track of the number of threads that have finished sorting. When a thread finishes sorting, it increments the counter and checks if all threads have finished. If not, it calls wait() on the lock object to wait for other threads. If all threads have finished, it calls notify() on the lock object to wake up any waiting threads. This process repeats until all threads have merged their sorted portions into the shared array."

My program then takes the array, splits into the amount of threads passed as an argument in the terminal, and gives each thread a piece of the array to sort, then stores all the threads in an array. Now, what I need some help with is this:I now want to take threads, as soon as they are done (Ie. if two are done before the others, they start to merge then wait for more). Think of it like braiding. I know how to write the sorting code for the merging, but what I hope you can help me with is this: How do I manage the threads? I know what wait() and notify() does, but I can't seem to be able to wrap my ead around what exactly I would need to do to make them merge into one array. Should I:Create a method inside the thread-class that merges the arrays?Create a new thread for every other thread that is done, pass the two sorted word-arrays as a parameter, and let that thread do the sorting?Something else I haven't thought of. I hope this was clear enough, and of good enough quality as the questions should be.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
