Here is an example:\n\nimport java.util.logging.*;\n\npublic class CustomLogger {\n    private static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(\"CustomLogger\");\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Create a custom log level\n        Level customLevel = new Level(\"CUSTOM\", 1000) {};\n\n        // Create a custom log handler\n        Handler customHandler = new FileHandler(\"custom.log\");\n\n        // Set the log level and handler for the custom logger\n        logger.setLevel(customLevel);\n        logger.addHandler(customHandler);\n\n        // Log messages with the custom level\n        logger.log(customLevel, \"Custom log message 1\");\n        logger.log(customLevel, \"Custom log message 2\");\n        logger.log(customLevel, \"Custom log message 3\");\n    }\n}\n\nThis code creates a custom logger named \"CustomLogger\" and sets a custom log level with a value of 1000. It also creates a custom log handler that writes log messages to a file named \"custom.log\". The logger is then configured with the custom level and handler. Finally, three log messages are logged using the custom level.\n\n<<<explanation>>>: This code demonstrates how to create a custom logger with a custom log level and log handler. You can modify the log level value and log messages as needed for your specific requirements. The log messages will be written to the specified log file."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: How to specify your own logging messages: :At work, I was asked to find a way of creating a customised logging level system that would output to a .log file. I found a way that works really well, so I thought I'd share. Please see my answer\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
