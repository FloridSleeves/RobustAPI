Here is an example of how to establish an SSH connection using JSch:\n\nimport com.jcraft.jsch.*;\n\npublic class SSHExample {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String host = \"hostname\";\n        String username = \"username\";\n        String password = \"password\";\n\n        try {\n            JSch jsch = new JSch();\n            Session session = jsch.getSession(username, host, 22);\n            session.setPassword(password);\n            session.setConfig(\"StrictHostKeyChecking\", \"no\");\n            session.connect();\n\n            Channel channel = session.openChannel(\"shell\");\n            channel.connect();\n\n            // Now you can send and receive data through the channel\n\n            channel.disconnect();\n            session.disconnect();\n        } catch (JSchException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: JSch is a popular SSH library for Java that provides a simple API for establishing SSH connections. In the example code, we create an instance of JSch and then create a session using the hostname, username, and password. We set the \"StrictHostKeyChecking\" configuration to \"no\" to disable host key checking. Then we connect the session and open a shell channel. Finally, we can send and receive data through the channel. Remember to handle any exceptions that may occur during the SSH connection process."

The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: SSH library for Java: :Closed. This question does not meet Stack Overflow guidelines.
