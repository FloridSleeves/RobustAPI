                "content": "<<<api>>>: List.get\n<<<code>>>: The issue seems to be with the logic in the Animation class. The currentFrame is incremented every time the work() method is called, but it is not reset to 0 when it reaches the end of the frames array. This causes the animation to stop after the first frame.\n\nTo fix this, you can add a check in the work() method to reset the currentFrame to 0 when it reaches the end of the frames array:\n\npublic void work() {\n    long elapsed = (System.nanoTime() - startTime) / 1000000;\n    if (elapsed > delay) {\n        currentFrame++;\n        startTime = System.nanoTime();\n    }\n    if (currentFrame == frames.length) {\n        currentFrame = 0;\n        playedOnce = true;\n    }\n}\n\nThis will ensure that the animation continues looping through all the frames in the frames array."

If the player loses his health the explosion should be triggered. I made 3 Classes. Animation Class, an Explosion Class and GameActivity Class. I tried to only post the relevant pieces.I searched the internet but I could not find a solution to my problem. So I am asking you if you maybe see my mistake and could help me. If more code is needed I will edit it of course. Maybe I am just overlooking something. Animation Class{public void setFrames(Bitmap[] frames){this.frames = frames;currentFrame = 0;startTime = System.nanoTime();}public void setDelay(long d){delay = d;}public void setFrame(int i){currentFrame= i;}public void work(){long elapsed = (System.nanoTime()-startTime)/1000000;if(elapsed>delay){currentFrame++;startTime = System.nanoTime();}if(currentFrame == frames.length){currentFrame = 0;playedOnce = true; }}public Bitmap getImage(){return frames[currentFrame];}public int getFrame(){return currentFrame;}public boolean playedOnce(){return playedOnce; }}This is the relevant part of the Explosion Class:Bitmap[] image = new Bitmap[numFrames];//Bitmap has 4 * 4 framesfor (int i = 0; i < image.length; i++) {if (i % 4 == 0 && i > 0) row++;image[i] = Bitmap.createBitmap(spritesheet, (i - (4 * row)) * width,  row * height, width*4, height*4);}animation.setFrames(image);animation.setDelay(10);}public void animating() {if (!animation.playedOnce()) {animation.work(); }}If the player loses all his health I call the explosion in GameActivityif (player.getHealth() < 0) {// player bitmap disappearsdissapear = true;//game endsgameEnded=true;explosion = new Explosion(BitmapFactory.decodeResource(getResources(),   R.drawable.images),player.getX(),player.getY()-10,9,9,25);explosion.animating();\nPlease using this api: List.get.\nAnswer:"
