In this case, the key size is set to 4096 bits, which means the maximum allowed size for the data is 501 bytes. To solve this problem without increasing the key size, you can split the data into smaller chunks and encrypt each chunk separately. Then, you can concatenate the encrypted chunks to obtain the final encrypted data. On the decryption side, you can decrypt each chunk separately and concatenate the decrypted chunks to obtain the original data."
