You should create the PrintWriter outside the loop and use the \"append\" mode to write to the file. This way, each line will be appended to the file instead of overwriting it."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: How do you read/write and combine the output of multiple .text files and create a single .txt file?: :This question already has answers here:                                                            How to use PrintWriter and File classes in Java?
