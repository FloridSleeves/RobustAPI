The PagerAdapter will be responsible for providing the views for each item in the list. You can load all the items into the PagerAdapter at once, and then the user can click through them using the next button.\n\nHere is an example of how you can implement this:\n\n1. Create a layout file for the widget, which includes a ViewPager and a next button.\n2. Create a PagerAdapter class that extends FragmentPagerAdapter or FragmentStatePagerAdapter.\n3. Override the getItem() method in the PagerAdapter to return a Fragment for each item in the list.\n4. In the Fragment, display the item's title and info.\n5. In the activity or fragment that hosts the widget, create an instance of the PagerAdapter and set it as the adapter for the ViewPager.\n6. Set an OnClickListener on the next button to increment the current item index and call viewPager.setCurrentItem() to update the displayed item.\n\nBy using a ViewPager, you can load all the items at once and allow the user to navigate through them using the next button. This approach should work on all versions of Android, including those older than 3.0.\n\nFor more details and examples, you can refer to the official Android documentation on ViewPager and PagerAdapter."
