In this example, the format is set to include the date, time, logger name, log level, and log message, all separated by spaces. The %n at the end adds a line break."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: How do I get java logging output to appear on a single line?: :At the moment a default entry looks something like this:Oct 12, 2008 9:45:18 AM myClassInfoHereINFO: MyLogMessageHereHow do I get it to do this?Oct 12, 2008 9:45:18 AM myClassInfoHere - INFO: MyLogMessageHereClarification I'm using java.util.logging\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
