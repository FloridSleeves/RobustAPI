First, create a PrintWriter object with the file name as the parameter. Then, iterate over the keys of the Hashtable and use the write() method to write each key-value pair to the file. Finally, close the PrintWriter to ensure that all the data is written to the file."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: How to write a hashtable<string, string > in to text file,java?: :I have hastablehtmlcontent  is html string of urlstring .I want to write hastable into a .text file .Can anyone suggest a solution?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
