In Java, you need to escape backslashes in file paths, so you should use \"D:\\\\test.bmp\" instead of \"D:\\test.bmp\". Additionally, you need to get the Image object from the ImageIcon and then use the drawImage() method to paint it on the applet window."

The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: How can I display a bitmap image in a Java applet?: :I am having a hard time figuring out how to show an Image (or ImageIcon) in a Java applet. The following is my code.  The picture (test.bmp) does exist and is on the D drive but when I run this I get the applet window with nothing in it.  Can somebody tell me what I am missing to make the ImageIcon show?public class Form1 extends JApplet {    ImageIcon i;    public void init(){        i = new ImageIcon(\"D:\\test.bmp\");    }    public void paint(Graphics g){        i.paintIcon(this, g, 0, 0);    }}Thanks, Steve.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
