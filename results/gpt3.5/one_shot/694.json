That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: output as UTF-8 encoding in java: :I am having problem with the output file from a program using eclipse .i set my eclipse to UTF-8 and with  System.getProperty(\"file.encoding\") i get UTF-8.i ran my prog via eclipse run-option and the output (a text file) is encoded in UTF-8.but when i compressed the source code into a jar file,the output file shows error in some of the alphabet like \u00c3.what is with this diff when ruuning the prog in eclipse and frm jar file?and do i have to specify the output to be encoded in utf-8 in my source code?pls help.help from @dacwe indeed produced the desired output.but may i know how can i run my executable .jar file outside command line?how can the -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 @dacwe :i tried changing my source code into  BufferedWriter bout  = new java.io.BufferedWriter(new java.io.OutputStreamWriter(                new java.io.FileOutputStream(filename), \"UTF-8\"));but the output still is not encoded correctly.anything i miss here?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
