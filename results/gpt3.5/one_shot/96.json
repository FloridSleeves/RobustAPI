Create a subclass of DataOutputStream and override the write(byte[] b, int off, int len) method.\n2. Inside the overridden method, call the super.write(b, off, len) to write the bytes to the output stream.\n3. Increment a counter variable by len to keep track of the number of bytes written.\n4. Provide a getter method to retrieve the value of the counter variable.\n\nHere is an example implementation:\n\npublic class CountingDataOutputStream extends DataOutputStream {\n    private int bytesWritten;\n\n    public CountingDataOutputStream(OutputStream out) {\n        super(out);\n        bytesWritten = 0;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void write(byte[] b, int off, int len) throws IOException {\n        super.write(b, off, len);\n        bytesWritten += len;\n    }\n\n    public int getBytesWritten() {\n        return bytesWritten;\n    }\n}\n\nYou can then use this CountingDataOutputStream to write the bytes and get the number of bytes written:\n\nCountingDataOutputStream countingOutputStream = new CountingDataOutputStream(client.getOutputStream());\ncountingOutputStream.write(bytes);\nint bytesWritten = countingOutputStream.getBytesWritten();\n\n<<<explanation>>>: This approach allows you to keep track of the number of bytes written by the DataOutputStream.

The server will send bytes to the client by calling DataOutputStream's write(bytes[] b), the DataOutputStream is wrapped around client.getOutputStream directly(no Buffer here).   This is a file download functionality And I'm going to support resume, I didn't use any HTTP here, I've implemented my own simple protocol.  I've seen these questions on SO :1-question1.2-C# question.3-FileChannel question.   The first doesn't answer my question, I can't wrap DataOutputStream around ByteArrayOutputStream because the latter can't be wrapped around client.getOutputStream and I don't know how to implement my own write(int i) method(And don't want to use JNI).   the second is C# not java(and it's calling WIN API anyway, I'm a linux user by the way :) ).   The third is talking about FileChannels and HTTP, As I said I'm not using HTTP and I'm using java Socket's API.  So how to get how many bytes were actually written ?PS (EDIT)By resume support I mean I'll give the client the ability to stop download at specific byte and then after a while(minutes,hours,days,whatever) he/she can resume download from where it has left.   \nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:"
