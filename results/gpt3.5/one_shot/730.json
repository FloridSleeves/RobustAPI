To fix this, you should create the PrintWriter object outside the loop and close it after the loop is finished. Additionally, you can use FileWriter to overwrite the file instead of appending to it."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Results printing to console but not to the file: :I'm trying to print to a .csv like so:(A and B are ArrayLists of type String)for(int i = 0; i < A.size(); i++) {    PrintWriter output = new PrintWriter(csvFile);    System.out.println(A.get(i)+\", \"+ B.get(i));    output.println(A.get(i)+\", \"+ B.get(i));}I'm getting the desired results to the console, however when I try to overwrite the file I am reading from, it is completely blank.  Any ideas?  I do need to overwrite the file as I don't want the original data preserved.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
