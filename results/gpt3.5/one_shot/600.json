The data parameter can be used to pass any additional data back to the calling activity.\nIn your MainActivity class, override the onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data) method. In this method, you can check the requestCode to make sure it matches the one you used when starting the second activity. Then you can handle the result based on the resultCode and data.\n<<<explanation>>>: By using startActivityForResult instead of startActivity, you can receive the result in the onActivityResult method of the calling activity.
