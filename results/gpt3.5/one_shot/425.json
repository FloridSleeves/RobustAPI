This means that the index of the next element to be compared also decreases by 1. By using a while loop and not incrementing j when a duplicate is found, you ensure that the next element to be compared is the same index as the one that was just removed."

Try to just use the value of the foreach inside the loop.\nQuestion: Removing duplicates in ArrayList w/o Hashset: :I am able to remove most of the duplicates except for the ones that are right next to each other. I have no idea what I am doing wrong. Right now I have nested for loops comparing an int to the rest in the ArrayList. except how I either setup or increment I am skipping the duplicate next to where I start the first for loop over again. I have found it useful to reset my i=0 after I remove my index j. It still won't remove the duplicate if they are right next to each other.for(int i=0;i<original.size();i++){    for(int j=i+1;j<original.size();j++){        if(original.get(i)==original.get(j)){            original.remove(j);           }    }}EDIT: I found my solution, when I changed my second for loop to a while loop, then incremented each time, but when I found a duplicate I removed 1 from j. That way I would be starting over.Thank you all. \nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
