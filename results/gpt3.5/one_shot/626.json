However, there is a typo in your code. Instead of \"asdmilk\", it should be \"Milk\". Here is the corrected code:\n\npublic abstract class Cow {\n    private static String name;\n    private static String code;\n\n    public static String getName() {\n        return name;\n    }\n\n    public static void setName(String name) {\n        Cow.name = name;\n    }\n\n    public static String getCode() {\n        return code;\n    }\n\n    public static void setCode(String code) {\n        Cow.code = code;\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Milk extends Cow {\n    static {\n        Milk.setName(\"Milk\");\n        Milk.setCode(\"KDDFA\");\n    }\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The issue with your code is that you are trying to set the static attributes in the Milk class using the abstract class's setters. However, static attributes are not inherited by subclasses, so you need to set them directly in the Milk class using the class name. Additionally, make sure to use the correct value for the name attribute."

Can you help me with this?\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Map.get\n<<<code>>>: import java.util.HashMap;import java.util.Map;Map<String, Integer> freq = new HashMap<String, Integer>();Integer count = freq.get(word);if (count == null) {freq.put(word, 1);}else {freq.put(word, count + 1);}\n<<<explanation>>>: If you look at the API for Map, get operations usually return null when the map does not contain the requested element. Note that this will make a solution.\nQuestion: Java static attributes in an abstract class: :I want to set the name and the code static attributes in the milk class.Why doesn't this work?I can't even override the setters/getters of the name and the code.    public abstract class Cow {        private static String name;        private static String code;    ...     public static String getName() {            return name;        }        public static void setName(String name) {            Cow.name = name;        }        public static String getCode() {            return code;        }        public static void setCode(String code) {            Cow.code = code;        }    ...    }public class Milk extends Cow{...    static {            Milk.setName(\"asdmilk\");        Milk.setCode(\"KDDFA\");        }..}\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:"
