Try to just use the value of the foreach inside the loop.\nQuestion: Iterator retrieve first value and place it back on the same iterator: :I have the following scenario: I have an existing iterator Iterator<String> it and I iterate over its head (say first k elements, which are flagged elements, i.e. they start with '*' ). The only way to know that the flagged elements are over, is by noticing that the (k+1)th element is not flagged. The problem is that if I do that, the iterator it will not provide me the first value anymore on the next call to next().I want to pass this iterator to a method as it's only argument and I would like to avoid changing its signarture and it implementation. I know I could do this:    public void methodAcceptingIterator(Iterator<String> it) //current signature   //change it to   public void methodAcceptingIterator(String firstElement, Iterator<String> it)But this looks like a workarround/hack decreasing the elegance and generality of the code, so I don't want to this. Any ideas how I could solve this problem ?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
