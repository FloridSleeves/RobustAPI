Here is an example of how to implement this feature:\n\n1. On the sending device (App A):\n   - Create a Socket object and connect it to the IP address and port of the receiving device (App B).\n   - Create an OutputStream object from the Socket and wrap it with a DataOutputStream.\n   - Use the DataOutputStream to write the data to be sent.\n\n2. On the receiving device (App B):\n   - Create a ServerSocket object and bind it to a port.\n   - Create a Socket object and accept the incoming connection from the sending device.\n   - Create an InputStream object from the Socket and wrap it with a DataInputStream.\n   - Use the DataInputStream to read the received data.\n\nHere is an example code snippet for the sending device (App A):\n\nval ipAddress = \"192.168.0.100\" // IP address of the receiving device\nval port = 1234 // Port number to connect\n\nval socket = Socket(ipAddress, port)\nval outputStream = socket.getOutputStream()\nval dataOutputStream = DataOutputStream(outputStream)\n\nval dataToSend = \"Hello, App B!\"\ndataOutputStream.writeUTF(dataToSend)\n\ndataOutputStream.close()\noutputStream.close()\nsocket.close()\n\nAnd here is an example code snippet for the receiving device (App B):\n\nval port = 1234 // Port number to bind\n\nval serverSocket = ServerSocket(port)\nval socket = serverSocket.accept()\nval inputStream = socket.getInputStream()\nval dataInputStream = DataInputStream(inputStream)\n\nval receivedData = dataInputStream.readUTF()\nLog.d(\"App B\", \"Received data: $receivedData\")\n\ndataInputStream.close()\ninputStream.close()\nsocket.close()\nserverSocket.close()\n\nMake sure to handle the network operations on separate threads to avoid blocking the main thread."
