We iterate through the array and update the frequency count in the map. Then, we iterate through the values of the map and count the number of values that are equal to 2, which represents the unique pairs. The getOrDefault() method is used to handle the case when a number is not yet present in the map. This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array."

May be not so good if n is quite big I guess...Well, 2 questions:am I understanding good how to \"measure\" the efficiency of the code?there's a better way to count the number of unique pairs in a given array?EDIT:Damn I've just posted and I'm already swamped by answers! Thanks! I'll study each one with care, for the time being I say I don't get those involving HashMap: out of my knowledge yet (hence thanks again for the insight:o) )\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:"
