Here's an example of how you can modify your code to handle compressed requests:\n\nimport java.util.zip.GZIPInputStream;\n\n// ...\n\n// Get the input stream from the request\nInputStream is = request.getInputStream();\n\n// Check if the request is compressed\nString contentEncoding = request.getHeader(\"Content-Encoding\");\nif (contentEncoding != null && contentEncoding.equalsIgnoreCase(\"gzip\")) {\n    // If the request is compressed, wrap the input stream with GZIPInputStream\n    is = new GZIPInputStream(is);\n}\n\n// Now you can read from the input stream as usual\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\nint bytesRead;\nwhile ((bytesRead = is.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n    // Process the data\n    // ...\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: To handle compressed requests, you can check the \"Content-Encoding\" header of the request. If it is set to \"gzip\", you can wrap the input stream with GZIPInputStream to decompress the data. Then, you can read from the input stream as usual. This allows you to keep the Content-Type as \"application/json\" while still compressing the request data."

The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: HTTP request compression: :General Use-CaseImagine a client that is uploading large amounts of JSON. The Content-Type should remain application/json because that describes the actual data. Accept-Encoding and Transfer-Encoding seem to be for telling the server how it should format the response. It appears that responses use the Content-Encoding header explicitly for this purpose, but it is not a valid request header.Is there something I am missing? Has anyone found an elegant solution?Specific Use-CaseMy use-case is that I have a mobile app that is generating large amounts of JSON (and some binary data in some cases but to a lesser extent) and compressing the requests saves a large amount of bandwidth. I am using Tomcat as my Servlet container. I am using Spring for its MVC annotations primarily just to abstract away some of the JEE stuff into a much cleaner, annotation-based interface. I also use Jackson for auto (de)serialization.I also use nginx, but I am not sure if thats where I want the decompression to take place. The nginx nodes simply balance the requests which are then distributed through the data center. It would be just as nice to keep it compressed until it actually got to the node that was going to process it.Thanks in advance,JohnEDIT:The discussion between myself and @DaSourcerer was really helpful for those that are curious about the state of things at the time of writing this.I ended up implementing a solution of my own. Note that this specifies the branch \"ohmage-3.0\", but it will soon be merged into the master branch. You might want to check there to see if I have made any updates/fixes.https://github.com/ohmage/server/blob/ohmage-3.0/src/org/ohmage/servlet/filter/DecompressionFilter.java\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
