If multiple threads are accessing or modifying the same array concurrently, it can lead to data corruption or inconsistent results. To ensure thread safety, you need to synchronize the access to arrays using synchronization mechanisms like locks or using thread-safe data structures like CopyOnWriteArrayList."
