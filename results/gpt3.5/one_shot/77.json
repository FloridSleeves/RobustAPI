Open a FileOutputStream to the file you want to write to.\n2. Create a DataOutputStream using the FileOutputStream.\n3. Iterate over your byte arrays and write each array to the DataOutputStream using the write method.\n4. After writing each array, write a separator (e.g., a newline character) to the DataOutputStream.\n5. Close the DataOutputStream and FileOutputStream.\n\nHere's an example code snippet:\n\n```java\nFileOutputStream fileOutputStream = new FileOutputStream(\"your_file_path\");\nDataOutputStream dataOutputStream = new DataOutputStream(fileOutputStream);\n\nfor (byte[] byteArray : yourByteArrays) {\n    dataOutputStream.write(byteArray);\n    dataOutputStream.writeBytes(System.lineSeparator()); // Write a separator (e.g., newline)\n}\n\ndataOutputStream.close();\nfileOutputStream.close();\n```\n\nTo read the byte arrays from the file, you can use a similar approach:\n\n1. Open a FileInputStream to the file you want to read from.\n2. Create a DataInputStream using the FileInputStream.\n3. Read the byte arrays from the DataInputStream using the read method.\n4. Split the read data using the separator you used while writing.\n5. Process each byte array as needed.\n6. Close the DataInputStream and FileInputStream.\n\nHere's an example code snippet:\n\n```java\nFileInputStream fileInputStream = new FileInputStream(\"your_file_path\");\nDataInputStream dataInputStream = new DataInputStream(fileInputStream);\n\nStringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder();\nString line;\nwhile ((line = dataInputStream.readLine()) != null) {\n    stringBuilder.append(line);\n    stringBuilder.append(System.lineSeparator()); // Add the separator back\n}\n\nString[] byteArrayStrings = stringBuilder.toString().split(System.lineSeparator());\n\nfor (String byteArrayString : byteArrayStrings) {\n    byte[] byteArray = byteArrayString.getBytes();\n    // Process the byte array as needed\n}\n\ndataInputStream.close();\nfileInputStream.close();\n```\n\nNote: This approach assumes that the byte arrays are in text format and can be converted to strings using the `getBytes` method. If your byte arrays contain binary data, you may need to use a different approach for reading and writing."

I can't do it in one time so I can't put my arrays in a container. Also the size of my arrays is variable.Secondly, the file is very huge, so I have to split it, in order to read it array by array.How can I do that ? I tried to write line by line my byte arrays  but I haven't been able. How can I put a separator between my arrays and after split it over this separator ?EDIT : I tried this :ByteArrayOutputStream bos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();ObjectOutput out = new ObjectOutputStream(bos);out.writeObject(byteArray);But, I execute this code several times, so the ObjectOutputStream adds each time a new header which corrupt the file.I also try : out.write(byteArray);but I couldn't separate my arrays. So I tried to append a '\\n', which didn't work. After I was looking for library like FileUtils in order to write byte[] line by line but I didn't find.\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:"
