That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: print value on netbeans log file: :I tried with different ways to print value on Log File of Netbenas6.9.1 . I am using Tomcat6.0 . Also checked server log ..but values r not getting printed on any log.Can any1 tell me how to print values using System.out.println() / java.util.Logger on console?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
