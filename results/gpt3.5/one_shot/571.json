If the iterator has a next element, return it. If not, reset the iterator to the beginning of the list and return the next element. This way, the list will be cycled through each time pickWidget() is called."

Try to just use the value of the foreach inside the loop.\nQuestion: Using Guava Iterables.cycle as a circular list impl: :I have a List<Widget> and am looking for the most efficient/elegant solution to loop over it, again and again (kind of like a round robin algorithm):// Returns a list of 20 widgets, with an id of 1 - 20 respectively.List<Widget> widgets = getWidgets();Widget widget = pickWidget(); // Returns the 1st widget with id = 1.widget = pickWidget(); // Returns the 2nd widget with id = 2.widget = pickWidget(); // Return the 3rd widget with id = 3.// ..etc.widget = pickWidget(); // Returns the 19th widget with id = 19.widget = pickWidget(); // Returns the 20th widget with id = 20.widget = pickWidget(); // Returns the 1st widget with id = 1 (it cycle back).That's the usage, for the implementation the best I've been able to find is Guava's Iterables.cycle(...):Widget pickWidget() {    for(Widget w : Iterables.cycle(widgets)) {        return w;    }}The problem is that cycle doesn't leave a marker inside widgets so that it can \"remember\" where it let off the last time pickWidget() was called.Any ideas here? Apache's CircularFifoQueue seems close but no cigar, as I don't want anything popped off the queue, I just want it to cycle over the same list time and time again as it is called.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
