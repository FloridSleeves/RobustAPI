Checked out other answers but nothing seems to be helpful. Any ideas?\nPlease using this api: File.createNewFile.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: File.createNewFile\n<<<code>>>: File file = new File(\"foo/bar.txt\")\ntry{\n    file.getParentFile().mkdirs();\n    file.createNewFile();\n} except {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");}\n<<<explanation>>>: It's likely that you're trying to create the file in a directory that does not exist. Use mkdirs() to create any missing parent directories first.\nQuestion: Error creating a file: :I'm trying to create a file and append some information. First thing I do is creating the folders, then I create the files.try {        if (!new File(\"Results\\\\\" + p.getName()).exists()) {            new File(\"Results\\\\\" + p.getName()).mkdir();        }    } catch (Exception e) {        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, \"Error creating the directory\");    }try {    PrintWriter  writer = new PrintWriter (\"Results\\\\\" + p.getName() + \"\\\\\" + simulation.getNameSim(), \"utf-8\");     //After this instruction jumps to exception    //Code    } catch (Exception e) {    }The variables p.getName and simulation.getName have the information. The debug says there are no erros creating the directory but after the print the program throws an exception.Any ideas? I'm creating the files inside a java's program directory because I need to send the program to another persons and I guess its not about permissions.\nPlease using this api: File.createNewFile.\nAnswer:"
