However, the issue you are facing is most likely due to the file being written in C# using BinaryWriter.Write(). The BinaryWriter class in C# writes data in a specific binary format that is not compatible with the read methods in Java's DataInputStream class. To properly read the data written by C# in Java, you will need to use a compatible binary format for writing and reading the data. One option is to use a library like Protocol Buffers or JSON to serialize and deserialize the data in a platform-independent way. Another option is to manually define a binary format that is compatible with both C# and Java and use it for reading and writing the data."

The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: reading c# binary files in java: :I have a program in C# .net which writes 1 integer and 3 strings to a file, using BinaryWriter.Write(). Now I am programming in Java (for Android, and I'm new in Java), and I have to access the data which were previously written to a file using C#. I tried using DataInputStream.readInt() and DataInputStream.readUTF(), but I can't get proper results. I usually get a UTFDataFormatException: java.io.UTFDataFormatException: malformed input around byte 21or the String and int I get is wrong...FileInputStream fs = new FileInputStream(strFilePath);DataInputStream ds = new DataInputStream(fs);int i;String str1,str2,str3;i=ds.readInt();str1=ds.readUTF();str2=ds.readUTF();str3=ds.readUTF();ds.close();What is the proper way of doing this?   \nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
