In this case, you can execute the \"mkfifo\" command to create a named pipe. The \"pipeName\" parameter should be replaced with the desired name for the named pipe. The process.waitFor() method is used to wait for the command to complete before continuing with the Java code."

Thus I would like to know how to create a named pipe in Windows from Java. In Linux I can use mkfifo (called using Runtime.exec() ), but how should I do this on Windows?\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:"
