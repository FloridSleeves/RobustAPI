Instead, you can use a fixed buffer size, such as 8192 bytes, and read from the input stream in chunks until there is no more data to read. This will ensure that all the data is transferred correctly."

The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Files don't transfer completely: :I'm trying to send a file from client to the server, but only ~8kb of lager files(~100kb) transferred. And pngs for example are not completely viewable.I really don't know why it stops earlier.Sending small testfiles(~1 kb) works great.The server part:                    ServerSocket fileSocket = new ServerSocket(p);                    boolean rdy = false;                    while (!rdy) {                        Socket client = fileSocket.accept();                        String fileName = \"C:/\" + args[2];                        String cmd = fileName + \"\\n\";                        OutputStreamWriter sWriter = new OutputStreamWriter(client.getOutputStream());                        sWriter.write(cmd, 0, cmd.length());                        sWriter.flush();                        InputStream inStream = client.getInputStream();                        FileOutputStream fileStream = new FileOutputStream(fileName);                        byte[] buffer = new byte[client.getReceiveBufferSize()];                        int bytesRead = 0;                        while ((bytesRead = inStream.read(buffer)) > 0) {                            fileStream.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);                        }                        fileStream.flush();                        ta.append(\"File transfered\");                        inStream.close();                        fileStream.close();                        rdy = true;                    }                    fileSocket.close();                    return;The client part:Socket client = new Socket(ip, port);        OutputStream outStream = client.getOutputStream();        FileInputStream fileStream = new FileInputStream(fileName);        byte[] buffer = new byte[(int) fileStream.getChannel().size()];        int bytesRead = 0;        System.out.println(\"Sending file: \" + fileName);        while ((bytesRead = fileStream.read(buffer)) > 0) {            outStream.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);        }        outStream.close();        fileStream.close();        client.close();        return;\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
