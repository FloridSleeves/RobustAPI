Instead, you can use FileOutputStream and OutputStreamWriter to write the string to a file. The code provided opens a file output stream using the specified filename and writes the text to the file using a PrintWriter. It then flushes and closes the writer, and sets the appropriate message on the msg TextView."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Can we use PrintWriter Class for saving a string in a file in an Android App? If yes, then how?: :If we can use PrintWriter Class in making an Android App, then what is the mistake in the following code? My app stops working on pressing the button 'save'public void save(View view)    {        text=data.getText().toString();        PrintWriter writer=null;        try {            writer=new PrintWriter(filename);        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {            msg.setText(\"FileNotFoundException\");            }        writer.print(text);        writer.flush();        writer.close();        msg.setText(\"Data Saved Successfully\");    }}\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
