Inside the ActionListener, it gets the table model of the JTable and loops through each cell in the table to get the values. You can then save the values to your desired location (e.g. database, file) inside the loop."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: How to save changes made to jTable: :My question is , how to save changes made to jTable?I want to save changes made to jTable by adding save button in my program, but I don't know the source code of save button.Please Help , can anybody send me the source code of save button.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
