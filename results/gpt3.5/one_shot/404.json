However, you can achieve similar functionality by using the ListIterator interface, which extends the Iterator interface and provides additional methods for bidirectional traversal and element access. You can use the next() and previous() methods to move the pointer without returning an element.\n<<<explanation>>>: The ListIterator interface provides more flexibility compared to the Iterator interface, allowing you to move the pointer in both forward and backward directions. You can use the next() method to move the pointer to the next element without returning it, and the previous() method to move the pointer to the previous element without returning it."

Try to just use the value of the foreach inside the loop.\nQuestion: Is there a conventional iterator interface in Java which separates traversal from element access?: :For my application, element access is expensive, so java.util.Iterator is no use.  I want something more like C++ iterators, where I can move the pointer around without returning an element.  Is there something in the standard library like this, or has some de facto standard interface evolved through custom?  (If not, please don't waste your time posting code snippets - I'm quite able to think up reasonable names which will do the job).  \nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
