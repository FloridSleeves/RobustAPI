In this example, we create a mapping where \"music\" is associated with 0 and \"film\" is associated with 1. Then, we can use the Map.get method to retrieve the corresponding int value for the given string. Finally, we can use the retrieved int values to access the desired element in the matrix."

Can you help me with this?\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Map.get\n<<<code>>>: import java.util.HashMap;import java.util.Map;Map<String, Integer> freq = new HashMap<String, Integer>();Integer count = freq.get(word);if (count == null) {freq.put(word, 1);}else {freq.put(word, count + 1);}\n<<<explanation>>>: If you look at the API for Map, get operations usually return null when the map does not contain the requested element. Note that this will make a solution.\nQuestion: Is it possible to link a string to an int?: :I want to be able to call on a certain int with the use of strings. So for instancefinal int music = 0;final int film = 1;int[][] matrix = new int[2][2];say I have a String m containing \"music\"and a String f containing \"film\"is there any way I could get this to work:matrix[m][f] = 1;\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:"
