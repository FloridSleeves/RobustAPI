It checks if the line starts with \"#\" to ignore commented lines. It then splits the line by \"=\" to get the key and value. If the line has exactly two parts, it trims the key and value and adds them to the properties map. Finally, it returns the map of properties."

The number of lines is not known in advance. The BufferedReader.readLine() method reads a line but after the last line it waits for input from the console.

It is a save game file but I can't use java.util.Properties for this (it is under the specification). I have to read the entire file and ignore commented lines and the keys that are not relevant in some classes. These properties are unique but they may be sorted in any order. My file current file looks like this:# BioplayerOrigin=NewlandsplayerClass=Warlock# ArmorplayerHelmet=emptyplayerUpperArmor=armor900playerBottomArmor=armor457playerBoots=boot109etcThese properties are going to be written and placed according to the player's progress and the filereader would have to reach the end of file and get only the matched keys. I've tried different approaches but so far nothing came close to the results that I would had using java.util.Properties. Any idea?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:"
