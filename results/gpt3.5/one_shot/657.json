We then create a HashMap called wordCount to store the word frequencies. We iterate over each word in the ArrayList and use the get method of the Map to retrieve the current count for that word. If the count is null (meaning the word is not yet in the Map), we add it with a count of 1. If the count is not null, we increment it by 1. Finally, we iterate over the entries of the wordCount Map and print out the word and its corresponding count."
