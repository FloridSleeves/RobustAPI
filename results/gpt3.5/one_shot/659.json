That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Message from server to client in Alert window: :I have this    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {    char[] charArray = reverse(request.getParameter(\"field\").toCharArray());    PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();}public char[] reverse(char[] array){    int id = 0;    char[] newArr = new char[array.length];    for(int i=array.length-1; i >= 0; i--){        newArr[id] = array[i];        id++;    }    return newArr;      }How can i hand off charArray to the main WebPage in AlertWindow?Please, help.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
