However, inside the `createDesign` method, you are assigning a new `RelativeLayout` to the `rel2MainActivity` parameter, which does not update the value of `relMainActivity` in the `MainActivity` class. To fix this, you need to assign the new `RelativeLayout` to `relMainActivity` directly in the `MainActivity` class."

I am confused how does it work? why doesn't it give error just like we get in java code? and most importantly, how does environment decide to which component it needs to invoke? I understand the process of id generation is automated, which gets added to R.java For instance, if we have same IDs, say \"image1\" in two XMLs, say \"layout1\" & \"layout2\". but in R.java it won't have 2 IDs. that means at a time it will reference only 1 component. In case we have to use 2 XMLs in an Activity, one as activity.setcontentview(layout1) and another as a PopupWindow.setContentView(layout2). What will happen in such case?\nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Activity.setContentView\n<<<code>>>: @Override\npublic void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n    Button myButton = (Button) findViewById(R.id.my_button);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You can findViewById of the current view hierarchy set to the activity. You cannot have same id for the view's in the same view tree. (must be unique).\nQuestion: create layout in code and get nullPointerException: :I create my layout in pure code.It worked and I decided to create another class to reuse my layout.I add a new class (Designer.java) to reuse my footer and header for other activities.I pass a context as parameter for other activities.rel2MainActivity has 3 childrenrelMainActivity is nullI don't understand what's wrong. I must have missed somethingMainActivity.javaRelativeLayout relMainActivity ;@Overrideprotected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {    // ...
