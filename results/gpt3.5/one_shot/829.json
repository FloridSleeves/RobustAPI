To copy the text line by line, you can split the string into an array of lines using the line separator, and then use PrintWriter.println to write each line separately."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Console output into text file: :code to convert HTML file to .txt file. code for reference..public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"D:/ticket.htm\"));    String line;    while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {        sb.append(line).append(System.getProperty(\"line.separator\"));    }    String nohtml = sb.toString().replaceAll(\"\\\\<.*?>\", \"\");    String nospace = nohtml.replaceAll(            \"^\\\\s+|\\\\s+$|\\\\s*(\\n)\\\\s*|(\\\\s)\\\\s*\", \"$1$2\");    String new1 = nospace.replace(\"\\t\", \" \");    System.out.println(new1);    PrintWriter outs = new PrintWriter(\"D:/text123.txt\");    outs.write(new1);    outs.println(new1);    outs.close();}new1 contains text(HTML output) which I am able to print line by line in the eclipse console,but when am trying to copy that text into text file (text123.txt), the text is copied in the same line. I need to same console output to be copied in the text file i.e line by line.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
