By passing the bytesRead value as the length parameter when creating the ByteArrayInputStream, you ensure that only the actual data read from the stream is used. This way, you can be sure that you are reading the body data (if any) starting from the correct position in the inputstream."

The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Safely reading http request headers in java: :I'm building my own HTTP webserver in java and would like to implement some security measures while reading the http request header from a socket inputstream.I'm trying to prevent scenario's where someone sending extremely long single line headers or absurd amounts of header lines would cause memory overflows or other things you wouldn't want.I'm currently trying to do this by reading 8kb of data into a byte array and parse all the headers within the buffer I just created.But as far as I know this means your inputstream's current offset is always already 8kb from it's starting point, even if you had only 100bytes of header.the code I have so far:InputStream stream = socket.getInputStream();HashMap<String, String> headers = new HashMap<String, String>();byte [] buffer = new byte[8*1024];stream.read( buffer , 0 , 8*1024);ByteArrayInputStream bytestream = new ByteArrayInputStream( buffer );InputStreamReader streamReader = new InputStreamReader( bytestream );BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader( streamReader );String requestline = reader.readLine();for ( ;; ){    String line = reader.readLine();    if ( line.equals( \"\" ) )        break;    String[] header = line.split( \":\" , 2 );    headers.put( header[0] , header[1] ); //TODO: check for bad header}//if contentlength > 0//      read bodySo my question is, how can I be sure that I'm reading the body data (if any) starting from the correct position in the inputstream?I don't exactly use streams a lot so I don't really have a feel for them and google hasn't been helpful so far\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
