Here is the corrected code:\n- The line \"super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\" was commented out, but it should be uncommented as it is necessary to call the superclass's onCreate method.\n- The line \"playB() throws IOException {\" is not valid syntax. Instead, you should define the method without the \"throws IOException\" part.\n- The line \"URI uri = URI.parse(\"android://com.max.bead/\" + resId);\" should be changed to \"Uri uri = Uri.parse(\"android.resource://com.max.bead/\" + resId);\". The correct syntax for creating a Uri object is \"Uri.parse()\".\n- The line \"mediaPlayer.play();\" should be changed to \"mediaPlayer.start();\". The correct method to start playing the media is \"start()\".\n\nAs for learning resources, here are a few recommendations:\n- Oracle's Java Tutorials: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/\n- Codecademy's Java Course: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java\n- Udemy's Java Programming Masterclass for Software Developers: https://www.udemy.com/course/java-the-complete-java-developer-course/"

I am confused how does it work? why doesn't it give error just like we get in java code? and most importantly, how does environment decide to which component it needs to invoke? I understand the process of id generation is automated, which gets added to R.java For instance, if we have same IDs, say \"image1\" in two XMLs, say \"layout1\" & \"layout2\". but in R.java it won't have 2 IDs. that means at a time it will reference only 1 component. In case we have to use 2 XMLs in an Activity, one as activity.setcontentview(layout1) and another as a PopupWindow.setContentView(layout2). What will happen in such case?\nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Activity.setContentView\n<<<code>>>: @Override\npublic void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n    Button myButton = (Button) findViewById(R.id.my_button);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You can findViewById of the current view hierarchy set to the activity. You cannot have same id for the view's in the same view tree. (must be unique).\nQuestion: Getting weird errors while using media player: :I'm new to Java and my friend helped me to write this code.  I'm getting errors on because I think I'm using the wrong syntax.  I've added comments to the code, where I'm having problems. I'm not even sure if I should be putting this code inside or outside of oncreate. Can anyone please point me to the directions for a good Java learning resource also.@TargetApi(Build.VERSION_CODES.HONEYCOMB)public class MainActivity extends ActionBarActivity {public MediaPlayer mediaPlayer;@Overrideprotected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {    /*super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);*/    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);    getActionBar().hide();    mediaPlayer = new MediaPlayer();  //getting an error on this line for invalid syntax.     //not sure what to put here        playB() throws IOException {            playSound(R.raw.b)        }     //not sure what to put here         playSound(int resId) throws IOException {             URI uri = URI.parse(\"android://com.max.bead/\" + resId);             if(mediaPlayer.isPlaying())             {                 mediaPlayer.stop();             }             else             {                 mediaPlayer.setDataSource(getApplicationContext(), uri);                 mediaPlayer.prepare();                 mediaPlayer.play();             }         }}\nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer:"
