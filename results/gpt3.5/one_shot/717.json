This typically happens when the servlet container determines that the response is complete and ready to be sent back to the client. The response is flushed when the server sends any buffered data in the response body to the client. This can happen automatically when the response is committed, or it can be manually triggered by calling the flush() method on the PrintWriter object.\n<<<explanation>>>: The println() method of PrintWriter writes a string to the output stream and appends a newline character. This can be used to write multiple lines of text to the response body. However, it does not directly affect the commit or flush behavior of the response."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: when is servlet response committed or flushed?: :According to javadoc:in-request.getRequestDispatcher(\"/Test\").forward(request,response);forward should be called before the response has been committed to the  client (before response body output has been flushed).Uncommitted output in the response buffer is automatically cleared before the forward.I am getting confused when this response is committed or been flushed?is this writing in println of printwriter.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
