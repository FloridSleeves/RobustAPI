Then, create a PrintWriter object to write the text to the file using the println method. Finally, close the PrintWriter to ensure that the changes are saved to the file."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: How to append text to an existing file in Java?: :I need to append text repeatedly to an existing file in Java. How do I do that?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
