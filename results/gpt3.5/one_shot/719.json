Here's an example:\n\nIn your GameSettingsServlet.java, after creating the Engine object, you can redirect to the BoardGame.html page with the boardSize parameter included in the URL:\n\nresponse.sendRedirect(\"BoardGame.html?boardSize=\" + boardSize);\n\nThen, in your BoardGame.html, you can retrieve the boardSize parameter using JavaScript:\n\nvar boardSize = parseInt(getParameterByName(\"boardSize\"));\n\nfunction getParameterByName(name) {\n    name = name.replace(/[\\[\\]]/g, \"\\\\$&\");\n    var regex = new RegExp(\"[?&]\" + name + \"(=([^&#]*)|&|#|$)\"),\n        results = regex.exec(window.location.href);\n    if (!results) return null;\n    if (!results[2]) return '';\n    return decodeURIComponent(results[2].replace(/\\+/g, \" \"));\n}\n\nNow, you can use the boardSize variable in your JavaScript code to create the board with the appropriate number of rows and columns.\n\nNote: The getParameterByName function is a helper function to retrieve query parameters from the URL. You can include it in your BoardGame.html file."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: How to pass parameters from servlet to JavaScript: :I am working on a board game with dynamic board size of 5x5,...,8x8This should be a game that runs on a web.  I am working with NetBeans and tomcat as the server for testing. I have the GameSettings.html which the user choose the board size and press submit.  The data is being sent to servlet named: GameSettingsServlet.java  There I pull out the boardSize and parse it to an integer:  @Overrideprotected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)        throws ServletException, IOException {   createEngine(request);   processRequest(request, response);}private void createEngine(HttpServletRequest request){    int boardSize = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter(\"boardSize\"));    int numberOfPlayers = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter(\"numberOfPlayers\"));    m_Engine = new Engine(boardSize, numberOfPlayers );}I want to create the board with javaScript so I need to send the boardSize parameter to the   javaScript (which should run on BoardGame.html)  in order to know how much rows and columns to create.How can I pass the boardSize to the javaScript or HTML ?I searched on the web but I found only about JSP and I need it on HTML.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
