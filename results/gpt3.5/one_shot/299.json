Here's an example code snippet:\n\npublic List<List<Object>> getAllCombinations(List<List<Object>> lists) {\n    List<List<Object>> result = new ArrayList<>();\n    getAllCombinationsHelper(lists, 0, new ArrayList<>(), result);\n    return result;\n}\n\nprivate void getAllCombinationsHelper(List<List<Object>> lists, int index, List<Object> current, List<List<Object>> result) {\n    if (index == lists.size()) {\n        result.add(new ArrayList<>(current));\n        return;\n    }\n    \n    List<Object> list = lists.get(index);\n    for (Object obj : list) {\n        current.add(obj);\n        getAllCombinationsHelper(lists, index + 1, current, result);\n        current.remove(current.size() - 1);\n    }\n}\n\n// Usage\nList<List<Object>> lists = new ArrayList<>();\nlists.add(Arrays.asList(1, 2));\nlists.add(Arrays.asList(10, 20, 30));\nlists.add(Arrays.asList(100));\n\nList<List<Object>> combinations = getAllCombinations(lists);\nSystem.out.println(combinations);\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The getAllCombinations method takes a list of lists as input and returns a list of all possible combinations. It uses a helper method, getAllCombinationsHelper, which uses recursion to generate all combinations. The base case is when the index reaches the size of the input list, at which point the current combination is added to the result list. In each recursive call, the method iterates over the elements of the current list and adds them to the current combination, then makes a recursive call with the next index. After the recursive call, the last element is removed from the current combination to backtrack and try the next element. Finally, you can call the getAllCombinations method with your input list and print the result."

If you think of the Object objects as integers, you could see it like this :{{1,2},{10,20,30},{100}}I need to get all possible lists containing exactly one element of each list, that is, come up with this :{{1,10,100},{1,20,100},{1,30,100},{2,10,100},{2,20,100},{2,30,100}}Of course you don't know at compiling time how much items the lists will contain, so you cannot rely on an overlapping of for loops...How would you come up with this? Time constraints are not relevant to my problem because the lists will likely contain few elements.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
