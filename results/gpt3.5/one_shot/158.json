The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Ways to proxy an InputStream: :I am using Android-Universal-Image-Loader to load images from remote server over HTTPS on my Android application. To have access to images the client should provide a valid token and sometimes server can return \"expired crsf token\" error. In order to handle this behavior a custom ImageDownloader should be defined. Below is the base implementation of method that should be overrrided in my implementation.protected InputStream getStreamFromNetwork(String imageUri, Object extra) throws IOException {    HttpURLConnection conn = createConnection(imageUri, extra);    int redirectCount = 0;    while (conn.getResponseCode() / 100 == 3 && redirectCount < MAX_REDIRECT_COUNT) {         conn = createConnection(conn.getHeaderField(\"Location\"), extra);         redirectCount++;    }    InputStream imageStream;    try {         imageStream = conn.getInputStream();    } catch (IOException e) {         // Read all data to allow reuse connection (http://bit.ly/1ad35PY)         IoUtils.readAndCloseStream(conn.getErrorStream());         throw e;    }    if (!shouldBeProcessed(conn)) {         IoUtils.closeSilently(imageStream);         throw new IOException(\"Image request failed with response code \" + conn.getResponseCode());    }    return new ContentLengthInputStream(new BufferedInputStream(imageStream, BUFFER_SIZE), conn.getContentLength());}I want to rewrite it to handle invalid token errors. For example, if the server returns such error it should be recognized, token should be regenerated and request repeated. The only solution I come up with is like this (shortened code):imageStream = conn.getInputStream();byte[] body = org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils.toByteArray(imageStream);if (body.length < 300  // high probability to contain err message             && isInvalidToken(body)) {              // handle error}return new ByteArrayInputStream(body);Is is safe to use such kind of solution, considering I use it only for thumbnails of max 80kb size? Are there any other solutions?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
