You can then submit tasks to the thread pool using the executor's submit() method. After submitting all the tasks, you can call the executor's shutdown() method to gracefully shut down the thread pool. This will allow any running tasks to complete, but prevent new tasks from being submitted."

As you can see an empty field is still correctly surrounded by tabs. Data is collected using a loop :\n\n while ((strLine = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(strLine, \"\t\");\n    String test = st.nextToken();\n    ...\n    }\nYet Java ignores this \"empty string\" and skips the field.\n\nIs there a way to circumvent this behaviour and force java to read in empty fields anyway?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: public class TestStringTokenStrict {\n\n/**\n * Strict implementation of StringTokenizer\n * \n * @param str\n * @param delim\n * @param strict\n *            true = include NULL Token\n * @return\n */\nstatic StringTokenizer getStringTokenizerStrict(String str, String delim, boolean strict) {\n    StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(str, delim, strict);\n    StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();\n\n    while (st.hasMoreTokens()) {\n        String s = st.nextToken();\n        if (s.equals(delim)) {\n            sb.append(\" \").append(delim);\n        } else {\n            sb.append(s).append(delim);\n            if (st.hasMoreTokens())\n                st.nextToken();\n        }\n    }\n    return (new StringTokenizer(sb.toString(), delim));\n}\n\nstatic void altStringTokenizer(StringTokenizer st) {\n    while (st.hasMoreTokens()) {\n        String type = st.nextToken();\n        String one = st.nextToken();\n        String two = st.nextToken();\n        String three = st.nextToken();\n        String four = st.nextToken();\n        String five = st.nextToken();\n\n        System.out.println(\n                \"[\" + type + \"] [\" + one + \"] [\" + two + \"] [\" + three + \"] [\" + four + \"] [\" + five + \"]\");\n    }\n}\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    String input = \"Record|One||Three||Five\";\n    altStringTokenizer(getStringTokenizerStrict(input, \"|\", true));\n}}\n<<<explanation>>>: The object your method decompressGZIP() needs is a byte[].\n\nSo the basic, technical answer to the question you have asked is:\nQuestion: java thread pool keep running: :This is more a generic question than a specific one. I'm trying to have a multi threaded environment that stays active so that I can just submit tasks and run them. I want to do this without the hassle of executing in a web server or application server. The idea was to use a java thread pool for this, but the issue here is that the pool stays open just until my main method finishes, after which obviously it closes and the program finishes. How can I prevent this from happening? I'm sure there are several options, some more naive than others (while true loops come to mind). Any ideas? Thanks. \nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
