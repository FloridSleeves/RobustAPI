The code above demonstrates how to do this. It reads each line from the original file using the BufferedReader's readLine() method, writes the line to the new file using the PrintWriter's write() method, and adds a line separator using System.lineSeparator(). Finally, it closes both the reader and writer to release system resources."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Taking data from one text file and moving it to a new text file: :I have a file that has data inside of it. In my main method I read in the file and closed the file. I call another method that created a new file inside of the same folder of the original file. So now I have two files, the original file and the file that is being made from the method that I call. I need another method that takes the data from the original file and writes it to the new file that is created. How do I do that?import java.io.*;import java.util.Scanner;import java.util.*;import java.lang.*;public class alice {    public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException {        String filename = (\"/Users/DAndre/Desktop/Alice/wonder1.txt\");        File textFile = new File(filename);        Scanner in = new Scanner(textFile);        in.close();        newFile();    }    public static void newFile() {        final Formatter x;        try {            x = new Formatter(\"/Users/DAndre/Desktop/Alice/new1.text\");            System.out.println(\"you created a new file\");        } catch (Exception e) {            System.out.println(\"Did not work\");        }    }    private static void newData() {    }}\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
