Instead, you can create a ByteArrayOutputStream and read the decrypted data into it using a buffer. Then, you can convert the ByteArrayOutputStream to a byte array to get the plain text."

The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Decrypting a CipherInputStream results in an empty stream: :I seem to be have an issue with JCE. I create an CipherInputStream using an encrypting JCE cipher which I then use to create another CipherInputStream using a different decrypting JCE cipher.When I try to read then second stream all I get is empty data. I found no documentation forbidding the above behavior. Does anyone know what the problem is?This is the code which I am running, at the end plainText is empty (the same issue persists regardless of what SecurityProvider I use).InputStream payload = new ByteArrayInputStream(payloadArray);Cipher encryptCipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES\", \"SunJCE\");encryptCipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key, IV);InputStream encryptStream = new CipherInputStream(payload, encryptCipher);Cipher decryptCipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES\", \"SunJCE\");decryptCipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, key, IV);InputStream decryptStream = new CipherInputStream(encryptStream, decryptCipher);byte[] plainText = IOUtisl.toByteArray(decryptStream);Thanks!\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
