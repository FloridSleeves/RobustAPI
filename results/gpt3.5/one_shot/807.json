However, the write() method of PrintWriter expects a character as input, not a byte. To add the BOM, you can use the Unicode escape sequence '\\ufeff' as a character literal. This will write the BOM character to the output stream."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: How to add a UTF-8 BOM in Java?: :I have a Java stored procedure which fetches record from the table using Resultset object and creates a CS Vfile.BLOB retBLOB = BLOB.createTemporary(conn, true, BLOB.DURATION_SESSION);retBLOB.open(BLOB.MODE_READWRITE);OutputStream bOut = retBLOB.setBinaryStream(0L);ZipOutputStream zipOut = new ZipOutputStream(bOut);PrintStream out = new PrintStream(zipOut,false,\"UTF-8\");out.write('\\ufeff');out.flush();zipOut.putNextEntry(new ZipEntry(\"filename.csv\"));while (rs.next()){    out.print(\"\\\"\" + rs.getString(i) + \"\\\"\");    out.print(\",\");}out.flush();zipOut.closeEntry();zipOut.close();retBLOB.close();return retBLOB;But the generated CSV file doesn't show the correct German character. Oracle database also has a NLS_CHARACTERSET value of UTF8.Please suggest.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
