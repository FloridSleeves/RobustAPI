That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: PrintWriter to append data if file exist: :I have a savegame file called mysave.sav and I want to add data to this file if the file already exists. If the file doesn't exists, I want to create the file and then add the data.Adding data works fine. But appending data overwrites existing data. I followed the instructions of axtavt here (PrintWriter append method not appending).     String savestr = \"mysave.sav\";     File f = new File(savestr);    PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(savestr);    if ( f.exists() && !f.isDirectory() ) {        out = new PrintWriter(new FileOutputStream(new File(savestr), true));        out.append(mapstring);        out.close();    }    else {        out.println(mapstring);        out.close();    }where mapstring is the string I want to append. Can you help me? Thank you!\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
