Here's an example:\n\nTo read bits from a file:\nFileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(\"input.txt\");\nBitInputStream bis = new BitInputStream(fis);\n\nint bit;\nwhile ((bit = bis.readBit()) != -1) {\n    // Process the bit\n}\n\nbis.close();\nfis.close();\n\nTo write bits to a file:\nFileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(\"output.txt\");\nBitOutputStream bos = new BitOutputStream(fos);\n\nint bit;\nwhile (/* condition */) {\n    // Get the bit to write\n    // Write the bit using bos.writeBit(bit);\n}\n\nbos.close();\nfos.close();\n\nYou will need to implement the BitInputStream and BitOutputStream classes yourself, which handle reading and writing individual bits from/to a stream. There are several examples available online that can help you with this implementation."

The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: How can I read/write bits from/to a file in Java?: :I need to read file stream as bits and then I should be able to write bits to file again. Are there any classes for this purpose?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
