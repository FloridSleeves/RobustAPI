Then, while reading each line from the input file, you can write the line to the appropriate output file based on the count. The count is used to determine which output file to write to by using the modulo operator (%). Finally, make sure to close all the file resources after you are done."

The last 6 bytes in my files contain crucial information when writing the files back. I need to write my original files, and then append the last 6 bytes elsewhere. Any guidance? Thanks\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: RandomAccessFile.read\n<<<code>>>: RandomAccessFile randomAccessFile = new RandomAccessFile(your_file, \"r\");randomAccessFile.seek(your_file.length() - n);try{randomAccessFile.read(byteArray, 0, n);} catch(IOException e) {e.printStackTrace();} \n<<<explanation>>>: You have to do it by using RandomAccessFile. Instances of this class support both reading and writing to a random access file. A random access file behaves like a large array of bytes stored in the file system. \nQuestion: Read file and split into multiple files: :I have a file which I would like to read in Java and split this file into n (user input) output files. Here is how I read the file:int n = 4;BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"file.csv\"));try {    String line = br.readLine();    while (line != null) {        line = br.readLine();    }} finally {    br.close();}How do I split the file - file.csv into n files?Note - Since the number of entries in the file are of the order of 100k, I can't store the file content into an array and then split it and save into multiple files.\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:"
