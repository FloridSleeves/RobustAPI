Can you help me with this?\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Map.get\n<<<code>>>: import java.util.HashMap;import java.util.Map;Map<String, Integer> freq = new HashMap<String, Integer>();Integer count = freq.get(word);if (count == null) {freq.put(word, 1);}else {freq.put(word, count + 1);}\n<<<explanation>>>: If you look at the API for Map, get operations usually return null when the map does not contain the requested element. Note that this will make a solution.\nQuestion: Hashmap Syntax error on tokens in java: :                                This question is unlikely to help any future visitors; it is only relevant to a small geographic area, a specific moment in time,  or an extraordinarily narrow situation that is not generally applicable to the worldwide audience of the internet.
