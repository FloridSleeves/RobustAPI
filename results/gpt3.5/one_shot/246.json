This will give you the dimensions of the image without actually loading the full image into memory. Then, you can calculate the desired sample size based on the desired width and height of the image. Finally, you can decode the stream again with the calculated sample size to load the image into a Bitmap. This way, you avoid the unnecessary sleep and improve the efficiency of loading the image."

The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: How to load image from url: :I am writing a little picture frame app for android that is using opengl for part of the UI.  This portion needs to get images from flickr and load them into a texture.  The code I have below is functional most of the time, but it has a Thread.sleep() kludge in between getting the input stream from the connection and the bitmap factory decoding the stream:            URL url = new URL(\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4132/5168797476_7a85deb2be_b.jpg\");            URLConnection con = url.openConnection();            InputStream is = con.getInputStream();            Thread.sleep(250); //What am I actually waiting for?            sourceBitmap = BitmapFactory.decodeStream(is);How do I get around using the sleep() method in favor of something that makes logical sense?I am testing on a samsung galaxy tab not in the emulator\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
