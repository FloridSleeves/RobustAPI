Ads are typically added to a layout, such as a RelativeLayout or LinearLayout. You can create a layout that contains both the canvas and the ad view, and then set that layout as the content view of your activity using setContentView. Here's an example:\n\n@Override\npublic void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n\n    // Get a reference to the canvas view\n    CanvasView canvasView = (CanvasView) findViewById(R.id.canvas_view);\n\n    // Get a reference to the ad view\n    AdView adView = (AdView) findViewById(R.id.ad_view);\n\n    // Add the canvas view and ad view to a layout\n    RelativeLayout layout = (RelativeLayout) findViewById(R.id.main_layout);\n    layout.addView(canvasView);\n    layout.addView(adView);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: In this example, the activity_main layout file contains a RelativeLayout with id \"main_layout\". Inside this layout, there are two views: a CanvasView with id \"canvas_view\" and an AdView with id \"ad_view\". The canvas view and ad view are added to the layout programmatically using the addView method. Finally, the layout is set as the content view of the activity using setContentView."

I am confused how does it work? why doesn't it give error just like we get in java code? and most importantly, how does environment decide to which component it needs to invoke? I understand the process of id generation is automated, which gets added to R.java For instance, if we have same IDs, say \"image1\" in two XMLs, say \"layout1\" & \"layout2\". but in R.java it won't have 2 IDs. that means at a time it will reference only 1 component. In case we have to use 2 XMLs in an Activity, one as activity.setcontentview(layout1) and another as a PopupWindow.setContentView(layout2). What will happen in such case?\nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Activity.setContentView\n<<<code>>>: @Override\npublic void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n    Button myButton = (Button) findViewById(R.id.my_button);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You can findViewById of the current view hierarchy set to the activity. You cannot have same id for the view's in the same view tree. (must be unique).\nQuestion: Displaying Ads on a custom canvas: :I am developing an android application in which I'd like to incorporate ads. The thing is, I'm not really sure how to add ads on a custom canvas. The canvas is not a part of any layout and is the only object drawn to the screen programmaticallysetContentView(canvas);Thanks.\nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer:"
