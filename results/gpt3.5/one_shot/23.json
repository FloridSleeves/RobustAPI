Then, we create a new matrix of EditText views with the given size. We get the parent layout (e.g., LinearLayout) from the XML layout file using its id (parent_layout). We then iterate over the rows and columns of the matrix, creating a new EditText view for each element and adding it to the parent layout. Finally, we add the row layout to the parent layout. The user can now enter values inside the matrix."

I am confused how does it work? why doesn't it give error just like we get in java code? and most importantly, how does environment decide to which component it needs to invoke? I understand the process of id generation is automated, which gets added to R.java For instance, if we have same IDs, say \"image1\" in two XMLs, say \"layout1\" & \"layout2\". but in R.java it won't have 2 IDs. that means at a time it will reference only 1 component. In case we have to use 2 XMLs in an Activity, one as activity.setcontentview(layout1) and another as a PopupWindow.setContentView(layout2). What will happen in such case?\nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Activity.setContentView\n<<<code>>>: @Override\npublic void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n    Button myButton = (Button) findViewById(R.id.my_button);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You can findViewById of the current view hierarchy set to the activity. You cannot have same id for the view's in the same view tree. (must be unique).\nQuestion: How would you draw a matrix in Android Development?: :The size of the matrix would be input by the user with variables h, w.Given this how would I create a matrix of that size on the screen allowing the user to enter in values inside the matrix.\nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer:"
