You can use a buffer to read the response in chunks and append it to a StringBuilder. Whenever a newline character is encountered, it means a complete line has been received, so you can add it to the result list. Finally, if there is any remaining content in the StringBuilder, add it to the result list as well."

The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: JSch shell returns into StringArray: :I am trying to relearn Java after 10 years of not touching it.  I want to create a library using JSch from some other apps I am looking to write.  I have the connections ironed out but I am using stdin and stdout right now.I am looking to have a method that accepts a single command in a String and returns an ArrayList with the results.Any assistance would be great!//This vars are in the class.private JSch _jsch;private Session _session;private Channel _channel;Here is my connection methodpublic boolean Connect () throws JSchException{    try {        _jsch = new JSch();        _session = _jsch.getSession(_user, _hostname, _port);              _session.setPassword(_password);        _session.setConfig(\"StrictHostKeyChecking\", \"no\");          _channel = _session.openChannel(\"shell\");        //((ChannelShell)_channel).setPtyType(\"vt100\");        _channel.setInputStream(bais);        _channel.setOutputStream(baos);        _channel.connect(3000);                         }//try to connect    catch (JSchException ex)    {        throw ex;    }    return true;}The goal is once I open the connection I can send this method a command and return the results in an array.  Act based on the results and send more commands.  I don't want to close the connection each time as they will build on the commands that come before it. I am not sure how to work with the Inputs and Output Streams enough to get the results I am looking for.  If you can assist with filling out the following method, I would be grateful.public List<String> ExecuteCommand (String command) {    //run command to existing connection    //Get returned lines to Array List and return the list}Thanks \nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
