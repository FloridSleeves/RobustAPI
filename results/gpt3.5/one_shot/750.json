The `println` method adds a line break after each string, which ensures that each input is written on a new line in the file."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: java programming, writing to text files: :how do i make this code write to the text file height.txt? it creates it but it doesnt write to it.and it also compiles and says data is written to the file but there isnt any data when i open the file why is that?import java.io.*;import java.util.Scanner;import java.io.PrintWriter;import java.io.FileWriter;public class readinguserinput {    public static String gender;    public static int motherHeight;    public static int fatherHeight;    static Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);    public static void main(String[] args)  {        try        {            FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(\"height.txt\");            PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(fw);        System.out.println (\"Enter gender\");        gender = keyboard.next();        System.out.println (\"Enter Mother Height\");        motherHeight = keyboard.nextInt();        keyboard.nextLine();        while (motherHeight < 0)        {            System.out.println (\"Enter Mother Height\");            motherHeight = keyboard.nextInt();        }        System.out.println (\"Enter father Height\");        fatherHeight = keyboard.nextInt();        while (fatherHeight < 0)        {       System.out.println (\"Enter Father Height\");            fatherHeight = keyboard.nextInt();        }        pw.close();        }catch (IOException e){            System.out.println(\"file not found\");        }        System.out.println(\"data written to the file\");}}\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
