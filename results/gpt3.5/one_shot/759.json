Here's an example:\n\nCountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(1);\n\nexecutorService.scheduleAtFixedRate(new Runnable() {\n    @Override\n    public void run() {\n        File file = new File(fileName);\n        if (file.exists()) {\n            Log.debug(\"creating new file\");\n            openFileWriter(file);\n            latch.countDown(); // Signal that the file has been created\n        }\n    }\n}, fileIntervalInSeconds, fileIntervalInSeconds, TimeUnit.SECONDS);\n\nlatch.await(); // Wait for the file to be created\n\n// Start writing to the file\n\n<<<explanation>>>: In this code, we create a CountDownLatch with an initial count of 1. Inside the scheduled task, after creating the file, we call latch.countDown() to signal that the file has been created. Then, we call latch.await() to wait for the file to be created before starting to write. This ensures that the writer is not used before it is closed and the file is created."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Java: creating file every number of seconds: :I'm using ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor to create a file every fileIntervalInSeconds seconds:executorService = new ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor(1);        executorService.scheduleAtFixedRate(new Runnable()        {            @Override            public void run()            {                    File file = new File(fileName);                    if (file.exists())                    {                        Log.debug(\"creating new file\");                        openFileWriter(file);                    }            }        }, fileIntervalInSeconds, fileIntervalInSeconds, TimeUnit.SECONDS);    }private void openFileWriter() throws FileSystemNotificationException{        // 1 - close exist writer        writer.close();        // 2 - rename to backup file name          ...        // 3 - create new file              FileWriter writerFile = new FileWriter(fileName, true);        writer = new PrintWriter(writerFile);}And i'm writing alert Messages to the file all the time:private synchronized void writeLine(String line) throws InterruptedException{    writer.println(line);}My problem is:how can i ensure that i'm using writer when it is not closed? (writer.close())How can i wait to the ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor to finish creating the file before start writing\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
