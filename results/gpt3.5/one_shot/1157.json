In Java, the split() method uses regular expressions as the delimiter. The character \"\u00a7\" has a special meaning in regular expressions, so it needs to be escaped using \"\\\\\". \n\nTo fix the issue, you can modify your code as follows:\n\nString input = \"Look like this\u00a70\u00a725\";\nString[] data = input.split(\"\\\\\u00a7\");\n\nThis will correctly split the input string into a 3-long String array with the values \"Look like this\", \"0\", and \"25\"."

As you can see an empty field is still correctly surrounded by tabs. Data is collected using a loop :\n\n while ((strLine = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(strLine, \"\t\");\n    String test = st.nextToken();\n    ...\n    }\nYet Java ignores this \"empty string\" and skips the field.\n\nIs there a way to circumvent this behaviour and force java to read in empty fields anyway?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: public class TestStringTokenStrict {\n\n/**\n * Strict implementation of StringTokenizer\n * \n * @param str\n * @param delim\n * @param strict\n *            true = include NULL Token\n * @return\n */\nstatic StringTokenizer getStringTokenizerStrict(String str, String delim, boolean strict) {\n    StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(str, delim, strict);\n    StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();\n\n    while (st.hasMoreTokens()) {\n        String s = st.nextToken();\n        if (s.equals(delim)) {\n            sb.append(\" \").append(delim);\n        } else {\n            sb.append(s).append(delim);\n            if (st.hasMoreTokens())\n                st.nextToken();\n        }\n    }\n    return (new StringTokenizer(sb.toString(), delim));\n}\n\nstatic void altStringTokenizer(StringTokenizer st) {\n    while (st.hasMoreTokens()) {\n        String type = st.nextToken();\n        String one = st.nextToken();\n        String two = st.nextToken();\n        String three = st.nextToken();\n        String four = st.nextToken();\n        String five = st.nextToken();\n\n        System.out.println(\n                \"[\" + type + \"] [\" + one + \"] [\" + two + \"] [\" + three + \"] [\" + four + \"] [\" + five + \"]\");\n    }\n}\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    String input = \"Record|One||Three||Five\";\n    altStringTokenizer(getStringTokenizerStrict(input, \"|\", true));\n}}\n<<<explanation>>>: The object your method decompressGZIP() needs is a byte[].\n\nSo the basic, technical answer to the question you have asked is:\nQuestion: String.split() not behaving in android: :I have a code in Java that is meant to get the server info from a Minecraft server. This returns data split by \u00a7. In eclipse, when run as an application, the code works fine. The issue is when I bring it to Android. I have done some research on this but haven't been able to find a working solution. (Have tried Pattern.quote(\"\u00a7\")) Here is an example of what I'm running:String input = \"Look like this\u00a70\u00a725\";String[] data = input.split(\"\u00a7\");The expected data would be a 3-long String[] with the values \"Look like this\", \"0\", and \"25\". This is what happens in eclipse. In android, I get a 1-long String[] with the value \"Look like this\u00a70\u00a725\". Does anyone know if this is an issue with android or am I doing something wrong?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
