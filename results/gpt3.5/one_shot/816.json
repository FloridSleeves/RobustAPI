Make sure that you are setting the character encoding correctly in both the request and response objects. In the provided code, you are setting the character encoding to \"utf-8\" in the response object, but it seems that it is not taking effect. You can try explicitly setting the character encoding in the PrintWriter object as well using the `resp.setCharacterEncoding(\"utf-8\")` method. Additionally, make sure that the encoding settings in your web.xml file are correct."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Response encoding of Google App Engine (can not change response encoding): :public class FeedUpdaterServlet extends HttpServlet {public void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp)        throws IOException {    PrintWriter out = resp.getWriter();    req.setCharacterEncoding(\"utf-8\");    resp.setLocale(Locale.TAIWAN);    resp.setContentType(\"text/html; charset=utf-8\");    resp.setCharacterEncoding(\"utf-8\");    resp.getWriter().println(\"Hello, world!!@!\");            out.println(\"\u6211\u662f\u4eba\");  //some chinese character    out.println(resp.getCharacterEncoding());    out.flush();    out.close();  }}web xml<locale-encoding-mapping-list>        <locale-encoding-mapping>            <locale>zh_TW</locale>            <encoding>utf-8</encoding>        </locale-encoding-mapping>    </locale-encoding-mapping-list>Output:Hello, world!!@! ???
