In this case, the getSupportActionBar() method is returning null, which means that the activity does not have an action bar. This can happen if you are using a theme that does not include an action bar, or if you have not set the action bar in your activity's layout file. To fix this issue, you can check if the action bar is null before invoking any methods on it."

I am confused how does it work? why doesn't it give error just like we get in java code? and most importantly, how does environment decide to which component it needs to invoke? I understand the process of id generation is automated, which gets added to R.java For instance, if we have same IDs, say \"image1\" in two XMLs, say \"layout1\" & \"layout2\". but in R.java it won't have 2 IDs. that means at a time it will reference only 1 component. In case we have to use 2 XMLs in an Activity, one as activity.setcontentview(layout1) and another as a PopupWindow.setContentView(layout2). What will happen in such case?\nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Activity.setContentView\n<<<code>>>: @Override\npublic void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n    Button myButton = (Button) findViewById(R.id.my_button);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You can findViewById of the current view hierarchy set to the activity. You cannot have same id for the view's in the same view tree. (must be unique).\nQuestion: NullPointerExcetption with AppCompat and ActionBar: :The Activity I have crashes everytime with this error. If I add any code related to getSupportActionBar() it crashes within that. Otherwise it crashes out of thatpublic class DishTag extends ActionBarActivity  implements OnClickListener{ //....    @Override    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {       setContentView(R.layout.dish_tag);       super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);       context=this;       //literally all the code I have       ActionBar a=getSupportActionBar();       a.setTitle(\"SD\");     }}To be noted and I don't know if this makes any difference but I am using a ViewPager on the page.The error is 11-30 22:06:38.212: E/AndroidRuntime(27315): Caused by:java.lang.NullPointerExceptionAttempt  to invoke virtual method 'java.lang.Class java.lang.Object.getClass()' on anull object reference\nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer:"
