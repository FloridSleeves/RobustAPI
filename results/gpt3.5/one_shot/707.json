This creates new local variables instead of assigning values to the instance variables. To fix this, remove the data type declaration in the constructor and simply assign values to the instance variables."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Java create a class to print ArrayList to file: :Here is the code I have.This is my PrintToFile classimport java.util.*;import java.io.*;public class PrintToFile{        File f;        FileWriter fw;        PrintWriter pw;    public void PrintToFile()throws Exception{//remove void from constructor      File f = new File (\"Output.txt\");//dont reinitialize       FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(f, true);//dont reinitialize      PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(fw);//dont reinitialize    }    public void printExp(ArrayList<Expense> expList){        for(int i = 0; i < expList.size(); i++){         pw.println(\"---------------------------------------\");//exception here         pw.println(expList.get(i));      }        pw.close();    }}in my main class here is my call to print my ArrayList    PrintToFile printer = new PrintToFile();    printer.printExp(expList);   I have defined expList as an ArrayList of objects The exception I get is a Exception in thread \"main\" java.lang.NullPointerExceptionoccuring where marked.
