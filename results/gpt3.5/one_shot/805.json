You can iterate over the array of strings and use the println() method to write each string to a new line in the file. Finally, close the PrintWriter to ensure the data is flushed and the file is closed.\n- To read strings from the file, you can use BufferedReader class with FileReader. Use the readLine() method in a loop to read each line from the file and insert it into the array. Finally, close the BufferedReader to release the resources."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Working with files in java: :I have an array of strings.I want to save those strings in a file.The problem is, I need to make a new file called db.txt (only if it doesn't exist),then somehow write strings to it.And then later I want to be able to read strings from that file and insert them to the array.Inserting and using array is not the question, but the question is how do I mess with the files? How do I create a new text file (if not existing already), how do I write to it and how do I read from it? Tried to learn it by myself but I've seen so many ways on the Internet and got confused.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
