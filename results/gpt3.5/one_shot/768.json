That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Android, upload a file in the tomcat server: :I am looking for code that can quickly upload an image from my android application in tomcat server.At the moment I have not found the java code to place in the tomcat server (servlet)\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
