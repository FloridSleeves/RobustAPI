When you read a byte with a value of -1, it is actually interpreted as the integer value 255. So when you add -1 + 1 + 0, you get 255 + 1 + 0, which equals 256. To get the expected result of 0, you can modify your code to read the bytes one by one and add them to a sum variable."

The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: ByteArrayInputStream#read() strange behaviour for negative input bytes: :I faced with this code in test.byte[] bytes = new byte[] { -1, 1, 0x0 }; InputStream in = new ByteArrayInputStream(bytes); System.out.println(in.read() + in.read() + in.read());I expected that this code returns 0 (-1+1+0) but it returns 256.I am very wondered.Who can explain this bahaviour?P.S.Revealed that the first statement returns 255. Why?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
