In the catch block, you can use the e.printStackTrace() method to print the exception stack trace to the PrintWriter object. Finally, remember to close the PrintWriter object to ensure that the data is written to the file."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: How do I write exceptions to a text file? (JAVA): :I am supposed to Use Scanner to read int values from a file \u201cinput.txt\u201d, Read until end of file is reached, Write all program output to a file \u201coutput.txt\u201d, Write all exceptions to a file \u201cerror.txt\u201d, and Output each number read.I understand exceptions for the most part, but I do not understand how to write all exceptions to a text file in Java...\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
