It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: How do i Dump contents of Vector into a new file?: :Here is my program to calculate prime numbers that are before 92. It works like a charm. I want my output to be put into a new file called VectorDump instead of it just being displayed on the regular screen. Where would I start this in my program here? Below is my code and the output of my code is at the bottom of the page.This is the output that I getThe primes before 92 are:2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 2931 37 41 43 47 53 59 61 67 7173 79 83 89import java.util.*;public class PrimeByVector{        public static void main(String[] args)        {                final int NUMBER_PER_LINE = 10;                int count = 0;//              java.util.Vector vector = new java.util.Vector();                Vector vector = new Vector();                System.out.println(\"The primes before 92 are: \\n\");                for (int n = 2; n < 92; n++)                  PrintWriter writer = null;                        try{                                writer = new PrintWriter(\"VectorDump\", \"UTF-8\");                     } catch (Exception e) {                      break;}                        Iterator it = vector.iterator();                      while(it.hasNext())                {                        writer.print(                     it.next() + \" \"                );                }                writer.close();{                        boolean isPrime = true;                        for (int i = 0; i < vector.size(); i++)                        {                                int primeNumber =                                        ((Integer)(vector.elementAt(i))).intValue();                                if (primeNumber > Math.sqrt(n)) break;                                if (n % primeNumber == 0)                                {                                        isPrime = false;                                        break;                                }                        }if (isPrime)                        {                                count ++;                                vector.addElement(new Integer(n));                                if (count % NUMBER_PER_LINE == 0)                                {                                        System.out.println(n);                                }                                else                                        System.out.print(n + \" \");                        }                }        }}PrimeByVector.java:15: error: not a statement                  PrintWriter writer = null;                  ^PrimeByVector.java:15: error: ';' expected                  PrintWriter writer = null;                             ^2 errors\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
