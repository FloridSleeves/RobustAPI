However, the issue you are facing is not related to the usage of Iterator.next but rather with how you are iterating over the dataSnapshot.getChildren(). The forEach loop you are using is causing the iterator to always return the first child's value. To fix this, you can use a traditional for loop with an iterator as shown below:\n\nfor(Iterator<DataSnapshot> it = dataSnapshot.getChildren().iterator(); it.hasNext(); ){\n    names.add(it.next().getValue(String.class));\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: In this code, we iterate over the dataSnapshot.getChildren() using an iterator. The iterator's next() method is called to get each element's value and add it to the names ArrayList. It ensures that each child's value is retrieved correctly rather than only getting the first child's value multiple times."
