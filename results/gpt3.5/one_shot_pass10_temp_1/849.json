One way to determine the uncompressed size is to read the entire GZIPInputStream and count the number of bytes read. In the code example provided, we create a GZIPInputStream from your_inputstream, then read the data in chunks of 1024 bytes and keep track of the total number of bytes read in the uncompressedSize variable. After reading all the data, we can use the uncompressedSize value to know the original (uncompressed) length for the gzip data. Make sure to close the GZIPInputStream after reading."

The last 6 bytes in my files contain crucial information when writing the files back. I need to write my original files, and then append the last 6 bytes elsewhere. Any guidance? Thanks\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: RandomAccessFile.read\n<<<code>>>: RandomAccessFile randomAccessFile = new RandomAccessFile(your_file, \"r\");randomAccessFile.seek(your_file.length() - n);try{randomAccessFile.read(byteArray, 0, n);} catch(IOException e) {e.printStackTrace();} \n<<<explanation>>>: You have to do it by using RandomAccessFile. Instances of this class support both reading and writing to a random access file. A random access file behaves like a large array of bytes stored in the file system. \nQuestion: Gets the uncompressed size of this GZIPInputStream?: :I have a GZIPInputStream that I constructed from another ByteArrayInputStream. I want to know the original (uncompressed) length for the gzip data. Although I can read to the end of the GZIPInputStream, then count the number, it will cost much time and waste CPU. I would like to know the size before read it.Is there a similiar method like ZipEntry.getSize() for GZIPInputStream:public long getSize ()Since: API Level 1  Gets the uncompressed size of this ZipEntry.\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:"
