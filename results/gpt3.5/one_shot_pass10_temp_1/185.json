                "content": "<<<api>>>: ANTLR\n<<<code>>>: You can use ANTLR's lexer modes to handle different syntax requirements or splitting commands into multiple lines. Here's a possible solution:\n\n1. Define your lexer rules for the initial line and command lines separately. For example:\n    INITIAL_LINE: 'X' REQUIREMENT ;\n    COMMAND_LINE: .+ ;\n\n2. Create lexer modes for each type of line. For example:\n    mode InitialLine;\n    mode CommandLine;\n\n3. Set the initial lexer mode to InitialLine. This can be done in your grammar's entry rule. For example:\n    grammar YourGrammar;\n    @members {\n        public void enterInitialLine(YourParser.InitialLineContext ctx) {\n            _input.pushMode(InitialLine);\n        }\n    }\n    initialLine : 'X' REQUIREMENT command* ;\n\n4. In the InitialLine lexer mode, handle the command lines. For example:\n    mode InitialLine;\n    COMMAND_LINE : .+ -> more, pushMode(CommandLine) ;\n\n5. In the CommandLine lexer mode, handle the end of each command line. For example:\n    mode CommandLine;\n    NEWLINE : '\\r'? '\\n' -> more, popMode ;\n\n6. In your parser, handle the different types of lines in separate production rules. For example:\n    requirement : REQUIREMENT ;\n    command : COMMAND_LINE ;\n\n7. Build and run your lexer and parser with the input from System.in.\n\n<<<explanation>>>: By using lexer modes, you can switch between different sets of lexer rules based on the syntax requirements. When encountering an initial line, you push the CommandLine mode to handle subsequent command lines. When reaching a newline, you switch back to the InitialLine mode.\nThis allows you to handle different types of lines separately in your parser, keeping the logic clean and maintainable."

Listener Pattern: Write a custom listener that implements the required logic for your language. For example, you can have a `RequirementListener` that checks the requirement in `enterRequirement` method. Then, create an instance of the listener and add it to a `ParseTreeWalker`. Finally, call `ParseTreeWalker.walk(listener, parseTree)` to traverse the parse tree and interact with the language.\n2. Visitor Pattern: Write a custom visitor that visits the parse tree and performs the required actions. For example, you can have a `RequirementVisitor` that checks the requirement in `visitRequirement` method. Then, create an instance of the visitor and call `parseTree.accept(visitor)` to visit the parse tree and interact with the language.\n\nRegarding handling commands split into multiple lines, you can modify the grammar to handle multi-line commands. You can define a rule for a command that spans multiple lines and ensure that the grammar correctly recognizes and merges the lines into a single command.\n\nReparsing all lines every time may introduce performance issues and running instructions twice. To avoid this, you can maintain a state in your listener/visitor and track the already parsed instructions or store the parsed instructions in a data structure for faster access.\n\nANTLR is a powerful tool for language recognition, and with the right grammar and customized listener/visitor, you can handle interactivity and complex language features."

I know it can be checked in doStuff, but I think logically it is part of the syntax.Or what if a command is split into multiple lines? I can trywhile(readline)  lines.add(line)  try    result = parse(lines)    lines = []    doStuff(result)  catch    nopBut with this I'm also hiding real errors.Or I could reparse all lines everytime, but:it will be slow there are instructions I don't want to run twiceCan this be done with ANTLR, or if not, with something else?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
