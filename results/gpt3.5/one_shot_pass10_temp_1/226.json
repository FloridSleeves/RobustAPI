In this class, you override the read() method to check for the special case of an ampersand (&) followed by the expected character sequence \"amp;\". If the sequence is found, you return the single ampersand character. This approach avoids the need to convert the entire stream into a String and back to a stream, and also avoids the incorrect replacement issue mentioned in the original code."

The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Right way of formatting an input stream: :I have the following issue: my program is passed an InputStream of which I cannot control the contents.  I unmarshal my input stream using the javax library, which rightfully throws exceptions if the InputStream includes the & character not followed by \"amp;\"The workaround I came up with was to create the following class:import java.io.ByteArrayInputStream;import java.io.FilterInputStream;import java.io.InputStream;/** * Provide an input stream where all & characters are properly encoded as &amp; */public class FormattedStream extends FilterInputStream {  public FormattedStream(InputStream src) {    super(new ByteArrayInputStream(StringUtil.toString(src)      .replace(\"&\", \"&amp;\").replace(\"amp;amp;\", \"amp;\").getBytes()));  }}Note: StringUtil is a simple utility I have to turn an input stream into a String.With that class in place, I now invoke the JAXB unmarshaller with:unmarshal(new FormattedStream(inputStream));instead ofunmarshal(inputStream);This approach works but does seem odd for a few reasons:1 - Because of the restriction that super must be the first element in the constructor (restriction which I fail to understand despite what I read about it), I am forced to do all my processing in one line, making the code far from readable.2 - Converting the entire stream into a String and back to a stream seems overkill3 - The code above is slightly incorrect in that a stream containing amp;amp; will be modified to containing amp;I could address 1 by providing a FormatInputStream class with one method:InputStream preProcess(InputStream inputStream)where I would do the same operations I am currently doing in the constructor of my FormattedStream class but it seems odd to have to choose a different interface because of a coding limitation.I could address 2 by keeping my FormattedStream constructor simple:super(src)and overriding the three read methods but that would involve much more coding: overriding the three read methods by replacing the & on the fly is not trivial compared to the one-line of code I currently have where I can leverage the replaceAll String method.As for 3, it seems enough of a corner case that I don't worry about it but maybe I should...Any suggestions on how to solve my issue in a more elegant way?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
