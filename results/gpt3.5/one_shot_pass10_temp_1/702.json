To handle this situation, you can store the initial lastModified value when you first start monitoring the file, and then compare it periodically with the current last modified time to determine if the file has been modified. Remember to handle exceptions in case the file does not exist or if there are any other errors."

To overcome this issue, you can consider using the java.nio.file package which provides the WatchService API for monitoring file changes. Here is an example code snippet:\n\nimport java.nio.file.*;\n\npublic class FileMonitor {\n\n   public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\n\n      // Define the directory and file you want to monitor\n      Path directory = Paths.get(\"path/to/directory\");\n      String fileName = \"filename.txt\";\n\n      // Create a watch service and register the directory\n      WatchService watchService = FileSystems.getDefault().newWatchService();\n      directory.register(watchService, StandardWatchEventKinds.ENTRY_MODIFY);\n\n      // Start an infinite loop to continuously monitor for file changes\n      while (true) {\n         WatchKey key = watchService.take();\n\n         for (WatchEvent<?> event : key.pollEvents()) {\n            // Check if the event is for the desired file\n            if (event.context().toString().equals(fileName)) {\n               System.out.println(\"File changed!\");\n               // React to file changes here\n            }\n         }\n\n         key.reset();\n      }\n   }\n}\n\nThis code uses the WatchService API in Java to monitor a specific file for changes. Whenever a change event occurs, you can react to it accordingly by adding your desired logic. The WatchService API provides more granular control over file monitoring compared to just using the lastModified() method."

However, it does not differentiate between actual modifications and changes in metadata, such as file open and close. Therefore, if you close a file without making any changes, the lastModified() method will still return a different value. This behavior is dependent on the underlying file system.\n\nIf you want to specifically check for changes made to the file content, you could keep track of the file size and compare it periodically with the current file size. If there is a difference, then the file content has been modified.\n\nRegarding the minute accuracy when using the \"dir\" shell script, this is because the \"dir\" command on Windows only provides minute-level accuracy for file modification times. If you need more precise accuracy, you may need to explore other platform-specific options or use a different method altogether."

However, if you are experiencing issues with the accuracy of the lastModified() value changing even when the file is closed without any changes, it may be a system-specific behavior or a bug.

In your case, when you close the file without making any changes, the operating system updates the last modified timestamp for the file. This behavior is expected, as the file was touched by the operating system, even though no actual modification occurred. To solve this, you can consider storing the initial last modified timestamp when you start monitoring the file, and then only react to changes if the last modified timestamp has changed.
