In order to solve this issue, you need to find the specific assertion that is failing and debug it. \nHere are a few steps to help you troubleshoot this error:\n1. Review the test case where the error occurs. Look for any assertions that are being made.\n2. Check the condition being tested in the assertion. Verify if it is correctly evaluating to true or false.\n3. Add print statements or use a debugger to inspect the values of variables involved in the assertion. Make sure they have the expected values.\n4. If you have multiple assertions in the test case, isolate the failing assertion by commenting out the others and rerun the test.\n5.

My professor send us a JUnit test so we can know if our code is working correctly. Now every method has passed the test except the iterator test which fails the test. It appears to be a java.lang.AssertionError and I cant seem to figure out a way of fixing it. If you could see the error and point it out to me would be awesome.
