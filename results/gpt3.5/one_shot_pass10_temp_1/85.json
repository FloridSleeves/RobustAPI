You're replacing the asterisks in the string with an empty string and then parsing it as an integer. However, when the count reaches 10, there are no asterisks left in the string and it becomes empty, causing the NumberFormatException.\n\nTo fix this, you can modify your server-side code as follows:\n```\nwhile (true){\n    in.read(data);\n    clientCount[0] = data[0];\n    clientCount[1] = data[1];\n    clientCount[2] = data[2];\n    clientCount[3] = data[3];\n    clientCount[4] = data[4];\n    clientCountString = new String(clientCount);\n    System.out.println(\"Received Count String: \\\"\" + clientCountString + \"\\\"\");\n    clientCountString = clientCountString.replace(\"*\", \"\");\n    \n    if (!clientCountString.isEmpty()) {\n        clientMessageCount = Integer.parseInt(clientCountString);\n        System.out.println(\"Client Count: \" + clientMessageCount + \", Server Count: \" + messageCounter);\n    } else {\n        System.out.println(\"Empty count string received, skipping parsing.\");\n    }\n    \n    out.write(data);\n    System.out.println(\"***********************************\");\n    messageCounter ++;\n}\n```\nWith this modification, when an empty clientCountString is encountered, the parsing is skipped and an appropriate message is printed.\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The NumberFormatException occurs because you are trying to parse an empty string as an integer.

The issue seems to be related to how the data is being read on the server side.

However, in a TCP connection, the data can be fragmented and may not be received in a single read operation.\n\nTo fix this issue, you should modify the server-side code to read the data in a loop until the entire message is received. Here is an example of how you can modify the server-side code:\n\n```java\nbyte[] data = new byte[35 * 1024];\nSystem.out.println(\"STARTING LOOP\");\nSystem.out.println(\"***********************************\");\nint messageCounter = 0;\nint clientMessageCount = 0;\nString clientCountString = \"\";\nbyte[] clientCount = new byte[5];\nint bytesRead;\n\nwhile ((bytesRead = in.read(data)) != -1) {\n    // Process the received data\n    for (int i = 0; i < bytesRead; i++) {\n        clientCount[i] = data[i];\n    }\n    // Rest of the code...\n}\n```\n\nBy reading the data in a loop and updating the clientCount array correctly, you can ensure that the full message is received before processing it."

The messages I'm sending are 25 kilos with the first 5 bytes containing the count from the client in the form of a string padded with asterisks to maintain a 5 byte length. However after 3 or 4 successful messages the server fails to find the count. Is there something that I am forgetting to consider? My guess is that the server is having trouble keeping up with the client as the number of successful messages varies from 3 - 4 before error.CLIENT SIDE CODE:try{        clientSocket = new Socket(\"192.168.0.15\", SERVER_PORT);           DataInputStream in = new DataInputStream(clientSocket.getInputStream());        DataOutputStream out = new DataOutputStream(clientSocket.getOutputStream());        int messageCounter = 0;        byte [] message1 = new byte[25 * 1024];        byte [] returnMessage1 = new byte[25 * 1024];        byte [] count;        long startTime1 = System.nanoTime();        while (messageCounter < 100000) {            System.out.println(messageCounter);            addCountToMessage(formatCount(messageCounter).getBytes(), message1);            out.write(message1);            in.read(returnMessage1);                 messageCounter ++;            }      }SERVER SIDE CODE: try {      byte [] data = new byte[35 * 1024];      System.out.println(\"STARTING LOOP\");      System.out.println(\"***********************************\");      int messageCounter = 0;      int clientMessageCount = 0;      String clientCountString = \"\";      byte[] clientCount = new byte[5];      while (true){          in.read(data);          clientCount[0] = data[0];          clientCount[1] = data[1];          clientCount[2] = data[2];          clientCount[3] = data[3];          clientCount[4] = data[4];          clientCountString = new String(clientCount);          System.out.println(\"Received Count String: \\\"\" + clientCountString + \"\\\"\");          clientCountString = clientCountString.replace(\"*\", \"\");          clientMessageCount = Integer.parseInt(clientCountString);          System.out.println(\"Client Count: \" + clientMessageCount + \", Server Count: \" + messageCounter);          out.write(data);          System.out.println(\"***********************************\");          messageCounter ++;      }   }OUTPUT OF SERVER:java TCPServerSTARTING LOOPReceived Count String: \"0****\"Client Count: 0, Server Count: 0Received Count String: \"1****\"Client Count: 1, Server Count: 1Received Count String: \"2****\"Client Count: 2, Server Count: 2Received Count String: \"3****\"Client Count: 3, Server Count: 3Received Count String: \"\"Exception in thread \"Thread-0\" java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: \"\"at java.lang.NumberFormatException.forInputString(NumberFormatException.java:65)at java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Integer.java:481)at java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Integer.java:527)at Connection.run(TCPServer.java:52)\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:"
