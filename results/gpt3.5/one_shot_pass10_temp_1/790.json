That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: How to save the text file in a path given by JFileChooser?: :I need to save a text File which is already created in a particular path given by JFileChooser. What I do basically to save is:public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {   JFileChooser chooser = new JFileChooser();   int status = chooser.showSaveDialog(null);   if (status == JFileChooser.APPROVE_OPTION) {      System.out.print(chooser.getCurrentDirectory());      // Don't know how to do it   }How to save the text file in a path given by JFileChooser?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
