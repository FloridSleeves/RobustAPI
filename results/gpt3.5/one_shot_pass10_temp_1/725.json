That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Converting text file to all uppercase letters: :I have an assignment for class and I have to make a program that takes an existing file and converts all the letters to uppercase. Below is part of the code (specifically the loop): // Read lines from the file until no more are left.  while (inputFile.hasNext())  {      // Read the next name.     String friendName = inputFile.nextLine();      // Need line to make all letters uppercase  }  System.out.print(\"Enter the saved file name: \");  String filename2 = keyboard.nextLine();When I run it now: I am able to open the first text file and a second txt file is created, but there is no letters in the new file. \nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
