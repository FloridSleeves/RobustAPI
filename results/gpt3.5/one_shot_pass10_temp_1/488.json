Here is an example:\n\nFirst, you need to define the batch size for lazy fetching in your Hibernate configuration:\nhibernate.jdbc.batch_size=25\n\nThen, in your code, you can use pagination to fetch a limited number of records at a time and iterate over them:\nSession session = sessionFactory.openSession();\nScrollableResults scrollableResults = session.createQuery(\"FROM Entity\").scroll(ScrollMode.FORWARD_ONLY);\n\nint pageSize = 10;\nint fetchedCount = 0;\nwhile (scrollableResults.next()) {\n    Entity entity = (Entity) scrollableResults.get(0);\n\n    // Process the entity here\n\n    fetchedCount++;\n    if (fetchedCount % pageSize == 0) {\n        session.clear(); // Clear the session to release memory\n\n        // Yield return the current batch and fetch the next batch\n        session.createQuery(\"FROM Entity\").setFirstResult(fetchedCount).setMaxResults(pageSize).list();\n    }\n}\n\nsession.close();\nscrollableResults.close();\n\nThis code uses the ScrollableResults interface to perform lazy fetching by scrolling through the result set. By setting the batch size as 25 in the Hibernate configuration, it will fetch 25 entities at a time.\n\nThe code then iterates over the fetched entities, processes them, and checks if the current batch count is equal to the page size. If it is, it clears the session to release memory, fetches the next batch using a query with the appropriate offset and limit, and continues the loop.\n\nBy using this approach, you can achieve lazy loading and effectively iterate over the collection with similar behavior to yield return in C#."
