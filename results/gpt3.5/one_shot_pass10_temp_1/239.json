The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds.

It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Measure bandwith used in transfering files with java sockets: :Does anyone knows how to do this? using the java sockets\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
