However, there are a few things that need to be fixed. \n\n1. In the main method, you are creating an instance of the `DocStats` class, but the actual class name is `Document`. So change `DocStats` to `Document`.\n\n2. In the `Document` class, you are not closing the `Scanner` after you finish reading the file. It's good practice to close resources when you're done with them. You can add a `sc.close()` statement at the end of each method.\n\n3. Regarding the issue with the number of characters, if the last sentence does not have a newline character, you can add an if statement to check if it's the last line and only add the length of the line without the additional 1 for the newline character.\n\n4. For the number of words and lines being 0, it could be because of the delimiter used in the `StringTokenizer`. Currently, it's set to \" ,\", which means it will only consider spaces and commas as delimiters. If your text includes other punctuation marks, you might need to add those as delimiters as well. For example, you can change it to \" ,-'?\"."

The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Java program to count lines, words, and chars from a text given file: :I am practicing to write a program that gets a text file from user and provides data such as characters, words, and lines in the text.I have searched and looked over the same topic but cannot find a way to make my code run.public class Document{private Scanner sc;// Sets users input to a file namepublic Document(String documentName) throws FileNotFoundException {    File inputFile = new File(documentName);    try {        sc = new Scanner(inputFile);    } catch (IOException exception) {        System.out.println(\"File does not exists\");    }}public int getChar() {    int Char= 0;    while (sc.hasNextLine()) {        String line = sc.nextLine();        Char += line.length() + 1;    }    return Char;}// Gets the number of words in a textpublic int getWords() {    int Words = 0;    while (sc.hasNext()) {        String line = sc.next();        Words += new StringTokenizer(line, \" ,\").countTokens();    }    return Words;}public int getLines() {    int Lines= 0;    while (sc.hasNextLine()) {        Lines++;    }    return Lines;}  }Main method: public class Main {    public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException {        DocStats doc = new DocStats(\"someText.txt\");        // outputs 1451, should be 1450        System.out.println(\"Number of characters: \"            + doc.getChar());         // outputs 0, should be 257        System.out.println(\"Number of words: \" + doc.getWords());        // outputs 0, should be 49        System.out.println(\"Number of lines: \" + doc.getLines());     }}I know exactly why I get 1451 instead of 1451. The reason is because I do not have '\\n' at the end of the last sentence but my method adds  numChars += line.length() + 1;However, I cannot find a solution to why I get 0 for words and lines.*My texts includes elements as: ? , - 'After all, could anyone help me to make this work? **So far, I the problem that concerns me is how I can get a number of characters, if the last sentence does not have '\\n' element. Is there a chance I could fix that with an if statement? -Thank you!\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
