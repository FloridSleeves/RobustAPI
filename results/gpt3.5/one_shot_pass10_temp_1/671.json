To split on the \\r\\n09/19/14 string, you need to escape the \\r and \\n characters using double backslashes, and also use a regular expression to match the date format in the string. Using \"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\d{2}/\\\\d{2}/\\\\d{2}\" as the split string will split the line at any occurrence of \\r\\n followed by a date in the format xx/xx/xx."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Java split() not working as expected: :I currently have text where I have \"TweetJSONObject\\r\\n09/19/14TweetJSONObject\" where the TweetJSONObject is just a tweet in json format. Now I'm using the .split() function to try separate the tweets from one another but it would seem that \\r\\n09/19/14 isn't an appropriate split string? Here is the code:String[] value = line.split(\"\\r\\n09/19/14\");PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"hello.txt\", \"UTF-8\");writer.println(value[0]);writer.close();The text file 'hello', when I open it is just the following string again, \"TweetJSONObject\\r\\n09/19/14TweetJSONObject\". Any ideas as to where I'm going wrong?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
