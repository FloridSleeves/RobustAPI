To print the exception stack trace, you can use the Throwable.printStackTrace method and provide a PrintWriter as the argument to direct the output to a file. However, if the file is not found, a FileNotFoundException will be thrown. In your code, it is not being caught, so the stack trace is not printed to the console and the file remains empty.
