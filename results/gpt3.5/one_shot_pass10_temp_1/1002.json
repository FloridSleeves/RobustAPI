This byte array is then converted to a Base64 string using the javax.xml.bind.DatatypeConverter.printBase64Binary() method.\n\nIn the C# code, the HMACSHA256.ComputeHash() method is used to compute the HMAC-SHA256 hash of the input bytes, which also returns a byte array. However, the byte array is directly converted to a Base64 string using the Convert.ToBase64String() method.\n\nThe difference in the resulting byte arrays and strings is likely due to platform-specific differences in the implementation of the HMAC-SHA256 algorithm or how the input bytes are processed (such as encoding and padding).\n\nTo troubleshoot and ensure consistency between the two platforms, you can try the following:\n1. Verify that the secretAccessKey and data strings are the same in both languages.\n2. Verify that the input bytes are being encoded using the same encoding (e.g., UTF-8) in both languages.\n3. Verify that the Base64 encoding used in both languages is compatible.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the differences in the byte arrays and result strings may not necessarily indicate an issue, as long as the implementation and usage of the HMAC-SHA256 algorithm are correct."
