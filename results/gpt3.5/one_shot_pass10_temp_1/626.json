We are working with static attributes and setters/getters in Java.\n<<<code>>>: The code you provided for setting the static attributes in the Milk class should work fine. However, you mentioned that you cannot override the setters/getters in the parent class. This is because static methods and attributes cannot be overridden in Java. They belong to the class itself, not to instances of the class. So when you call `Milk.setName(\"asdmilk\")` and `Milk.setCode(\"KDDFA\")`, you are directly accessing and modifying the static attributes in the Cow class, since Milk extends Cow.\n<<<explanation>>>: Static attributes and methods are not tied to any specific instance of a class. They belong to the class itself. In your code, the `name` and `code` attributes are shared by all instances of the Cow class and its subclasses, including Milk. When you call the static methods `Milk.setName` and `Milk.setCode`, you are directly modifying the static attributes in the Cow class.\nIf you want different values for `name` and `code` for each subclass, you can consider making them non-static and removing the static keyword. This will make them instance variables, and you can override the setters/getters in each subclass accordingly."

In this case, the name and code attributes are being declared as static in the abstract Cow class. This means that they are shared among all subclasses of Cow, including Milk. Changing the value of name and code in the Milk class will also change the value for all other subclasses of Cow.\n\nIf you want each subclass to have its own name and code attributes, you should remove the static keyword from the attribute declarations in the Cow class. This way, each subclass will have its own separate copy of the attribute.\n\nHere's an example of how you can modify the code to achieve this:\n\npublic abstract class Cow {\n    private String name;\n    private String code;\n\n    public String getName() {\n        return name;\n    }\n\n    public void setName(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n\n    public String getCode() {\n        return code;\n    }\n\n    public void setCode(String code) {\n        this.code = code;\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Milk extends Cow {\n    static {\n        Milk milk = new Milk();\n        milk.setName(\"asdmilk\");\n        milk.setCode(\"KDDFA\");\n    }\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: By removing the static keyword from the attribute declarations in the Cow class, each subclass will have its own separate copy of the attribute.
