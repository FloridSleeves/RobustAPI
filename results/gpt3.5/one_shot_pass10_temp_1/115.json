When receiving the byte array in the Python client code, convert it back to a NumPy array before decoding it as an image:\n   data = recvall(camera_socket, length)\n   nparr = np.frombuffer(data, np.uint8)  # Use frombuffer instead of fromstring\n   frame = cv2.imdecode(nparr, cv2.IMREAD_UNCHANGED)  # Use IMREAD_UNCHANGED instead of CV_LOAD_IMAGE_UNCHANGED\n\nNow, you should be able to successfully decode the byte array as an image in Python."
