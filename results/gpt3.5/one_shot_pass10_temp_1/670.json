When you write a double value using PrintWriter, it is converted to a string representation before being written to the file. This is why you are seeing the ASCII representation of the double value instead of the actual value. To write a double value directly as binary data, you should use the DataOutputStream class instead of PrintWriter. The DataOutputStream class provides methods for writing various types of primitive data, including double. In the provided code, I have updated the method to use DataOutputStream.writeDouble to write the double value to the file as binary data."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Not working I/O method: :I'm pretty new to JAVA, so I do not really see what I am doing wrong within the following method:public void writeWNDFile(){        String strFilePath = \"C:/Users/fperrone/Desktop/ddd.txt\";        try        {          //create FileOutputStream object          FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(strFilePath);           DataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(fos);           dos.writeDouble(12);                       dos.close();        }        catch (IOException e)        {          System.out.println(\"IOException : \" + e);        }    }The file is actually generated, but I don't get 12 as printed and expected result, but @(, which probably is the ASCII representation.May you shed some light?EDITDoes eventually exist a JAVA function behaving similarly to the MATLAB fwrite function? I actually wanna write a binary file. In MATLAB I am simply calling:fwrite(filename, A, precision)How could I achieve the same in JAVA?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
