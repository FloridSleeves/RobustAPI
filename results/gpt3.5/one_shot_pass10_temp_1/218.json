The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Why Java System.in.read() can call which is not a static method: :In java, java.lang.System class, which has an in static variable. Declared as: public static final InputStream in Which means that in is an InputStream varibale. However I see some example, using System.in.read() to read input.  How can it do that, the read() method in InputStream is not a static method, how can it be directlly call it? As my understanding, only static method can call directly by a Class without creating an instance.read() declartion: public abstract int read() throws IOExceptionThank you Jon Skeet for answering, I still have some point don't understand.If I call System.in.read() which mean that I call InputStream class method read() ?java.lang.System.in -----> java.io.InputStream ----> read()calling java.lang.System.in ( which is a static variable), in is a java.io.InputStream variableThe calling act like calling PrintStream class.The process work like calling : PrintStream.read()however I have difficulty on understand the read() method, which is not a static method, as it\u2019s should not be call directly.It should be call like: PrintStream rd = new PrintStream();int c = rd.read();as read() should be call by an instance.read() declartion: public abstract int read() throws IOExceptionPS: I try this code does not work:InputStream rd = new InputStream();        int c = rd.read();        System.out.println(c);But do not know why.ref: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/InputStream.html\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
