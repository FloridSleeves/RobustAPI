Here's an example of how you can do it:\n\n1. Create the Cipher instance with AES algorithm and padding:\n   Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\");\n\n2. Generate a secret key and initialization vector (IV):\n   SecretKeySpec secretKeySpec = new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, \"AES\");\n   IvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(ivBytes);\n\n3. Initialize the cipher with the mode (e.g. Encrypt or Decrypt) and the secret key and IV:\n   cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secretKeySpec, ivSpec);\n\n4. Open the RandomAccessFile in \"rw\" mode:\n   RandomAccessFile raf = new RandomAccessFile(\"encrypted.log\", \"rw\");\n\n5. Seek to the end of the file:\n   raf.seek(raf.length());\n\n6. Create a CipherOutputStream with the initialized cipher and the RandomAccessFile:\n   CipherOutputStream cos = new CipherOutputStream(raf, cipher);\n\n7. Write the encrypted data to the CipherOutputStream:\n   cos.write(encryptedData);\n\n8. Close the CipherOutputStream and RandomAccessFile:\n   cos.close();\n   raf.close();\n\n9. To decrypt the file, you would follow similar steps but with Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE.\n\n<<<explanation>>>: To append data to an encrypted file without having to decrypt it each time, you can use a combination of RandomAccessFile and CipherOutputStream. By seeking to the end of the file before writing, you can avoid overwriting existing data. The data you write should already be encrypted before passing it to the CipherOutputStream. With this approach, you don't need to decrypt the entire file to append new data."

The cipher is configured with \"AES/CTR/NoPadding\" mode, which allows the output data size to be divisible by the block size. The message is first encrypted using the cipher's doFinal() method, and then written to the file using RandomAccessFile's write() method. Finally, the file is closed."

Is there any way to work with encrypted file without having to decrypt it every time I want to append some messages?EDIT: little more details. Current implementation utlizes CipherOutputStream. As i understand there's no way to seek using it.Can i use 'NoPadding' option if i will control that output data size is divisible by block size?\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.write.\nAnswer:"
