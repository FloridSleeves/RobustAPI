You are trying to use the LIKE operator with the % wildcard, but you're not using it correctly. You need to include the wildcard characters in the selection argument, not in the selection string.\n\nHere's how you can fix it:\n\npublic static Cursor getSuggestions(String query) {\n    SQLiteDatabase db = dbHelper.getReadableDatabase();\n    db.beginTransaction();\n    try {\n        String selection = Formula.FORMULA_NAME + \" LIKE ?\";\n        String[] selectionArgs = { \"%\" + query + \"%\" };\n        Cursor cursor = db.query(\n            FORMULA_TABLE_NAME,\n            new String[]{BaseColumns._ID, SearchManager.SUGGEST_COLUMN_TEXT_1, BaseColumns._ID + \" AS \" + SearchManager.SUGGEST_COLUMN_INTENT_DATA_ID},\n            selection,\n            selectionArgs,\n            null,\n            null,\n            null);\n        db.setTransactionSuccessful();\n        return cursor;\n    } catch (SQLiteException e) {\n        // handle exception\n    } finally {\n        db.endTransaction();\n    }\n    throw new SQLException(\"Failed to begin transaction\");\n}\n\nExplanation:\nIn the selection string, you should use \"LIKE ?\" instead of \"LIKE %?%\", and then in the selectionArgs, you need to concatenate the wildcard characters (\"%\") with the query string (\"%\"+query+\"%\"). This will ensure that the query matches any value in the FORMULA_NAME column that contains the query string anywhere within it.\n\nAlso, make sure you're using the same instance of the SQLiteDatabase object throughout the method (in your code, you were using dbHelper.getReadableDatabase() twice to get separate instances).\n\nNote that this solution assumes that you want a case-insensitive search. If you want a case-sensitive search, you can use \"LIKE ? COLLATE NOCASE\" in the selection string instead."
