It is designed to rotate elements in a list. \nTo achieve a similar functionality with a Map, you can convert the Map to a list of entries using Map.entrySet(), rotate the list using Collections.rotate, and then convert it back to a Map using a loop or a stream. Here's an example:\n\nMap<String, Integer> teamWins = new HashMap<>();\n// Populate the teamWins map\n\nList<Map.Entry<String, Integer>> entryList = new ArrayList<>(teamWins.entrySet());\nCollections.rotate(entryList, 1);\n\nMap<String, Integer> rotatedTeamWins = new HashMap<>();\nfor (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : entryList) {\n    rotatedTeamWins.put(entry.getKey(), entry.getValue());\n}\n\nNow, the rotatedTeamWins map will have the same entries as the original teamWins map, but with the entries rotated by one position."

It is not applicable for Map collections because Maps do not maintain an order like Lists do. Instead, you can consider using a LinkedHashMap which maintains the order of the elements. However, if you want to shuffle the entries in the map, you can convert it to a List and then use Collections.rotate on the List."

Positive rotationAmount rotates the elements to the right, while negative rotationAmount rotates the elements to the left.\n\nKeep in mind that this approach will not randomize the key-value pairs in the Map, but rather change the order of the entries.

At the moment I read all the teams into a list. and use Collections.rotate to rotate the list in order to randomize the fixtures.I was thinking of using a Map to hold the team and number of wins, however rotate doesn't appear to work for map.
