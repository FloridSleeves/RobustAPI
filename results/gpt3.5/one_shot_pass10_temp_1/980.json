In your case, when you pass _source2.getBytes() as the argument to in.read(), it reads the byte representation of your string. However, this method reads only a single byte at a time, so your Scanner is waiting for more input.\n\nTo fix this, you can convert your string into a byte array using String.getBytes() method and pass the byte array to the ByteArrayInputStream, just like you did with _source. This way, your readR method will read the entire string without waiting for more input."

Here's the corrected code:\n\nString _source = \"321\";\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[_source.getBytes().length];\nByteArrayInputStream in = new ByteArrayInputStream(_source.getBytes());\nin.read(buffer);\nString _source2 = new String(buffer, \"UTF-8\");\n_myClass.readR(in);\n\nThis way, the bytes read from the input stream are stored in the `buffer` array, and then converted into a String using the \"UTF-8\" encoding."
