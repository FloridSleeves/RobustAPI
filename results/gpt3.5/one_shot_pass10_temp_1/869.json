I wrote an alternative implementation for writeLong using a byte[]. Something like this:\n\nRandomAccessFile randomAccessFile = new RandomAccessFile(\"out.dat\", \"rwd\");\n...\nbyte[] aux = new byte[8];\naux[0] = (byte) ((l >>> 56) & 0xFF);\naux[1] = (byte) ((l >>> 48) & 0xFF);\naux[2] = (byte) ((l >>> 40) & 0xFF);\naux[3] = (byte) ((l >>> 32) & 0xFF);\naux[4] = (byte) ((l >>> 24) & 0xFF);\naux[5] = (byte) ((l >>> 16) & 0xFF);\naux[6] = (byte) ((l >>> 8) & 0xFF);\naux[7] = (byte) ((l >>> 0) & 0xFF);\nrandomAccessFile.write(aux);\n\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: RandomAccessFile.write\n<<<code>>>: {\n    RandomAccessFile raf = new RandomAccessFile(\"test.dat\", \"rwd\");\n    int longCount = 10000;\n    long start = System.nanoTime();\n    for (long l = 0; l < longCount; l++)\n        raf.writeLong(l);\n    long time = System.nanoTime() - start;\n    System.out.printf(\"writeLong() took %,d us on average%n\", time / longCount / 1000);\n    raf.close();\n}\n{\n    RandomAccessFile raf = new RandomAccessFile(\"test2.dat\", \"rwd\");\n    int longCount = 10000;\n    long start = System.nanoTime();\n    byte[] aux = new byte[8];\n    try {\n        for (long l = 0; l < longCount; l++) {\n            aux[0] = (byte) (l >>> 56);\n            aux[1] = (byte) (l >>> 48);\n            aux[2] = (byte) (l >>> 40);\n            aux[3] = (byte) (l >>> 32);\n            aux[4] = (byte) (l >>> 24);\n            aux[5] = (byte) (l >>> 16);\n            aux[6] = (byte) (l >>> 8);\n            aux[7] = (byte) l;\n            \n            raf.write(aux);\n            \n        }\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    }\n    long time = System.nanoTime() - start;\n    System.out.printf(\"write byte[8] took %,d us on average%n\", time / longCount / 1000);\n    raf.close();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: It appears that the RandomAccessFile.writeLong() doesn't minimise the number of calls to the OS. The cost increases dramatically by using \"rwd\" instead of \"rw\" which should be enough to indicate its not the calls themselves which cost the time. (its the fact the OS is try to commit every write to disk and the disk only spins so fast)\nQuestion: Update data to file each amount of bytes: :I want to write my content data to a file each 10kb of file. It looks like this: What I tried: FileInputStream is; FileOutputStream out; File input = new File(filePath); int fileLength = input.length(); int len = 0;    while (len < fileLength){        len += is.read(buff);        // write my data        out.write(data, 0, data.length);       // how to move is to read next 10kb???    }I wonder is there anyway to move the cursor reader to next amount of bytes? Or do I miss anything?Update:Thank to @DThought, here is my implementation:    File input = new File(filePath);    long fileLength = input.length();    byte[] data;    byte[] buff = new byte[data.length];    long JUMP_LENGTH = 10 * 1024;    RandomAccessFile raf = new RandomAccessFile(input, \"rw\");    long step = JUMP_LENGTH + data.length;    for (long i = 0; i < fileLength; i += step) {        // read to buffer        raf.seek(i);        raf.read(buff);        raf.seek(i); // make sure it move to correct place after reading        raf.write(data);    }    raf.close();And it worked well.\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.write.\nAnswer:"
