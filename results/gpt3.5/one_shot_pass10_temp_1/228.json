One way to achieve this is by using a custom protocol where each message starts with a header that indicates the type of the message (text or file), followed by the actual content of the message.\n\nWhen a client wants to send a file, it can send a file header followed by the file content. The file header can include information such as the file name and size. On the server side, you can have a separate thread that listens for file transfers. When it receives a file header, it can create a new thread to handle the file transfer, while the main server thread continues to handle text messages.\n\nHere is a simplified example:\n\nOn the client side:\n1. Establish a connection to the server using a single socket.\n2. When sending a file, send a file header first, followed by the file content.\n\nOn the server side:\n1. Accept the client connection and create a new thread to handle it.\n2. Read data from the client and check the message header.\n3. If it is a file header, create a new thread to handle the file transfer.\n4. If it is a text message header, process the text message.\n5. Continue listening for new messages on the same socket.\n\nBy using this approach, you can handle both text messages and file transfers on the same port without the need for multiple ports.\n\n<<<explanation>>>: Multiplexing is a technique that allows for multiple logical streams to be carried over a single physical connection. In this case, you can use a custom protocol to separate text messages and file transfers, allowing them to be handled simultaneously on the same port."

For example, you can use a control byte with value 0 to indicate a text message and a control byte with value 1 to indicate a file transfer. On the server side, you can read the control byte and based on its value, handle either the text message or the file transfer accordingly.

And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Files transfered simulatanously with other data over one connection: :I have a multi-threaded server that handles client requests, and makes new threads for each one that is connected. This is working great and I am able to send \"text\" messages back and forth to the server without a problem. Like a chat system.Now I have in mind a way to be able to send files across these client connections to the server, but every single example I see in java always has a hard-coded file name on server / client side - but I want to set my own for flexibility. And I would love if it were not only able to not only receive files but also receive \"text\" messages on the same port simulatanously.I have an idea whereby the \"text\" message port I have at the moment, tells the server a file is going to be sent from a client, then the server opens up a \"file transfer\" port, just for file transfers. That way the \"text\" port could specify the name etc of the file. And the other port could send the files quite happily, without interruption.Does anyone know a better way to do this though? I don't really want to use two ports, it seems a bit messy. I would prefer to make a separate thread on the server side to deal with the file transfer and also deal with \"text\" message at the same time, if this is even possible?Thanks in advance, I hope I have been clear enough :)\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
