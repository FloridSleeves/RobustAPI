The first token is parsed as an int to get the access type, and the second token is taken as the memory address. A Trace object is created using these values and added to the traceList.\n\nThe main() method then calls the processFile() method for each file to populate the traceList. After that, you can loop through the traceList and process each trace as needed.\n\nBy processing each file separately and storing the data in an ArrayList, you can avoid loading all the data into memory at once, which can lead to OutOfMemoryError."

This avoids the need to load the entire file into memory at once, which can cause an out of heap space error. You can read the file line by line using a BufferedReader and process each line individually."

First I need to read 1 or more trace files. Each contains memory addresses for each access. Example: 0 F001CBAD2 EEECA89F0 EBC17910...Where the first integer indicates a read/write etc. then the hex memory address follows. With this data, I am supposed to run a simulation. So the idea I had was parse these data into an ArrayList<Trace> (for now I am using Java) with trace being a simple class containing the memory address and the access type (just a String and an integer). After which I plan to loop through these array lists to process them. The problem is even at parsing, it running out of heap space. Each trace file is ~200MB. I have up  to 8. Meaning minimum of ~1.6 GB of data I am trying to \"cache\"? What baffles me is I am only parsing 1 file and java is using 2GB according to my task manager ... What is a better way of doing this?
