Whenever you insert a new node into the ArrayList, you also update the HashMap with the new mapping. To access any node in O(1) time, you can simply retrieve its index from the HashMap and then use List.get(index) to get the actual node.\nHere is an example implementation:\n\n```\nclass DoublyLinkedList {\n    private List<Node> nodeList;\n    private Map<Integer, Integer> nodeMap; // key: node ID, value: index in the nodeList\n\n    public DoublyLinkedList() {\n        nodeList = new ArrayList<>();\n        nodeMap = new HashMap<>();\n    }\n\n    public void insert(Node newNode) {\n        int newIndex = nodeList.size();\n        nodeList.add(newNode);\n        nodeMap.put(newNode.getID(), newIndex);\n    }\n\n    public void moveNodeToEnd(int nodeID) {\n        if (!nodeMap.containsKey(nodeID)) {\n            return; // node not found\n        }\n\n        int index = nodeMap.get(nodeID);\n        Node node = nodeList.get(index);\n\n        nodeList.remove(index);\n        nodeMap.remove(nodeID);\n\n        nodeList.add(node);\n        nodeMap.put(nodeID, nodeList.size() - 1);\n    }\n\n    public Node getNode(int nodeID) {\n        if (!nodeMap.containsKey(nodeID)) {\n            return null; // node not found\n        }\n\n        int index = nodeMap.get(nodeID);\n        return nodeList.get(index);\n    }\n}\n```\nWith this implementation, you can insert nodes into the DoublyLinkedList, retrieve any node in O(1) time using `getNode(int nodeID)`, and move a specific node to the end of the list in O(1) time using `moveNodeToEnd(int nodeID)`."
