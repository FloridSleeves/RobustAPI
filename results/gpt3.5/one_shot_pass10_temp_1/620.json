To fix this, you need to move the code inside a method or constructor like this:\n\nimport java.util.HashMap;\nimport java.util.Map;\n\npublic class HTMLObjectMap {\n    HashMap<String, String> params = new HashMap<String, String>();\n\n    public void setParams() {\n        params.put(\"test\", \"test\");\n    }\n}\n\nYou need to call the setParams method to execute the code that puts the key-value pair into the HashMap.\n<<<explanation>>>: The Map interface provides the put method to add key-value pairs to a Map. In your case, you are trying to add a key-value pair to a HashMap called params. However, you cannot directly invoke methods outside of a method or constructor in Java. To fix this, you need to move the code inside a method or constructor where it can be executed. Inside the setParams method, you can then call the put method on the params HashMap to add the key-value pair \"test\" and \"test\"."
