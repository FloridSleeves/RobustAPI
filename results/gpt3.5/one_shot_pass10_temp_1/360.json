By casting it to Map.Entry, you are telling the compiler to treat the returned object as a Map.Entry type. This is necessary because the Map.Entry interface provides methods to access the key and value of the entry. If you don't cast it, you won't be able to access these methods. However, if you're using a newer version of Java that supports type inference (such as Java 8 or later), you can write var m = i.next(); and the compiler will infer the type based on the context."
