That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Filewriter and spaces?: :I was asked to write an assignment wherein the user would be prompted to input a key and/or a value. So far, here is my code:import java.util.Scanner;import java.io.*;class bTree{    //Fields    static Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);    static boolean done = false;    public static void main(String args[])throws Exception    {        FileWriter fWriter = new FileWriter(\"data.txt\");        do        {            System.out.print(\"Enter command: \");            String enter[] = input.nextLine().split(\" \", 3);            if(enter[0].toLowerCase().equals(\"insert\"))            {                fWriter.write(enter[1] + \"\\n\" + enter[2] + \"\\n\");                fWriter.flush();            }            else if(enter[0].toLowerCase().equals(\"select\"))            {                FileReader fReader = new FileReader(\"data.txt\");                Scanner fileInput = new Scanner(fReader);                while(fileInput.hasNext() && done == false)                {                    if(fileInput.nextLine().equals(enter[1]))                    {                        System.out.println(fileInput.nextLine());                        done = true;                    }                    else                    {                        fileInput.nextLine();                    }                }                done = false;            }            else if(enter[0].toLowerCase().equals(\"update\"))            {                fWriter.write(enter[2]);                fWriter.flush();            }            else if(enter[0].toLowerCase().equals(\"exit\"))            {                System.exit(0);            }        }        while(true);    }}Problem: When i open the data.txt, there are no spaces. So if i enter \"insert 1001 gen\" and \"10001 genny\", in notepad, it would come out as \"1001gen10001genny\". Any suggestions?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
