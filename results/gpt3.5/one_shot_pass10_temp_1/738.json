I'm not entirely sure what I'm seeing, but is this what you were talking about?public FileReader(String fileName);I've got this so far.FileWriter fwriter = new FileWriter(\"BigMoneys.txt\", true);PrintWriter outputFile = new PrintWriter(fwriter);for (int year = 1; year<= 10; year++){    amount = principal * Math.pow(1.0 + rate, year);    outputFile.append( year + \"\\t\" + moneyFormat.format(amount) + \"\\n\");}outputFile.close();JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, outputTextArea, \"Compound Interest\", JOptionPane.INFORMATION_MESSAGE);System.exit(0);The rest of this was covered in my textbook fairly well, and all makes decent sense, but I just checked and the book has nothing about FileReader.All I know is I'm supposed to use what's in outputFile and append it to outputTextArea. I'm honestly not trying to get you to do my homework for me, I'm just really really lost.So if I am supposed to use that line above, could I do this?FileReader(String fwriter)EDIT2: This is what I've got so far.
