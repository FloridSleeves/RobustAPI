But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: FileOutputStream set encoding to utf-8: :a want to set a file to utf-8the FileOutputStream takes just two parametermy code is  PrintWriter kitaba1 = null;    try {       kitaba1 = new PrintWriter(new FileOutputStream(new File(ismmilaf), true ));    } catch (FileNotFoundException ex) {        ex.printStackTrace();    }    //kitaba1.println(moarif1);    kitaba1.close();\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
