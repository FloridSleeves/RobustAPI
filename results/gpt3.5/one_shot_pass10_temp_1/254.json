The number of bytes actually read is returned in the `bytesRead` variable. Then, the `write` method is used to write that block of data to the output stream.

It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time.
