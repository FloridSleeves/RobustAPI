My problem is the header of the table is causing me problems while I am going through my while look(since its not passing my data quality checks).  Is there a way to skip the first row?  Iterator HoldingsTableRows = HoldingsTableRows.iterator();    while (HoldingsTableRows.hasNext()) {}I could get the contents of a variable and if it matches I can break out of the loop but I'm trying to avoid hard coding anything specific to the header names because if the names of the headers change it would break my app.please help!Thanks!\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
