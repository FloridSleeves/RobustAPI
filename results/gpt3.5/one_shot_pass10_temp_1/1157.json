To overcome this issue, you can use the Pattern.quote() method to escape the \u00a7 character and treat it as a literal character.

In regular expression syntax, the character `\u00a7` has a special meaning, which causes the split to ignore it as a delimiter and treat it as part of the input string instead.\n\nTo solve this problem, you can use `Pattern.quote(\"\u00a7\")` as the parameter for `String.split()`. This method escapes any special characters in the regular expression, so that the split behaves as expected and treats `\u00a7` as a normal character for splitting the string."

By default, when splitting a string using String.split(), any trailing empty strings are discarded. In your case, the trailing empty strings are being discarded and you are left with the original string in the resulting array.\n\nTo include trailing empty strings in the resulting array, you can pass a negative limit parameter to the split() method. By setting the limit parameter to -1, the split() method will include trailing empty strings in the resulting array.\n\nIn your code, you can modify the split() method call as follows:\n\nString[] data = input.split(\"\u00a7\", -1);\n\nThis should give you the expected result of a 3-long String array with the values \"Look like this\", \"0\", and \"25\" in both Eclipse and Android."
