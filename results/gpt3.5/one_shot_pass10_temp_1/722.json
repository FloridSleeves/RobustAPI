But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Grep output to file (Java): :How can I store the output of a grep in a file using Java?I'm using Runtime and Process to execute the grep, then I read the InputStreamBufferedReader stdInput = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(pr.getInputStream()));and now I'd like to store the content of the grep in a file, but I'm getting an empty file.With String s = null;while ((s = stdInput.readLine()) != null) {    System.out.println(s);}I am correctly seeing the grep's output. However, when I try to write it to a file, the file is empty.PrintWriter writer = null;writer = new PrintWriter(\"grep__output\", \"UTF-8\");writer.println(s);writer.close();Also, I tried to directly writing to file in the above while (previously creating the file), but it's the same.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
