The issue you are facing is due to the file not being found.\n\nTo fix this issue, the first thing you need to do is make sure that the \"test.in.txt\" file exists in the correct location. In your case, it should be located in the bin folder of your project. If it is not there, you need to create the file and add the desired numbers to it.\n\nOnce you have ensured that the file exists, you can try running the code again. If the file still cannot be found, make sure that the file name and extension are correct (\"test.in.txt\").\n\nAdditionally, I have added an if statement to check if there are tokens available to be read from the StringTokenizer before trying to parse them as integers. This is to handle cases where the file does not have the expected number of tokens.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the input file contains only two integers, separated by whitespace. If there are additional lines or characters in the input file, the code will need to be adjusted accordingly."
