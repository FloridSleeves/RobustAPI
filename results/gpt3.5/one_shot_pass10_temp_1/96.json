The `size()` method returns the current size of the output stream, and the `available()` method returns the number of bytes that can be read from the input stream without blocking. By subtracting the number of available bytes from the size, you can calculate the number of bytes that were actually written.\n\nPlease note that this method only works for non-blocking sockets. If you are using blocking sockets, the `available()` method will block until there is data to read.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that `write()` may not write all the bytes at once.
