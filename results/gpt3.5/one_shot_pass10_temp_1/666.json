It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Exporting variables with multiple values?: :import java.util.*;import java.text.*;import java.io.*;public class AvgTime {static double hrs1;static double min1;public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException, FileNotFoundException {Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);System.out.print(\"How many times? \");int numOfTimes = in.nextInt();double hrTotal = 0;double minTotal = 0;for (int i = 1; i <= numOfTimes; i++){  System.out.println(\"\\nEnter time in military time notation: \");  System.out.print(\"Hour  \");  double hrs1 = in.nextDouble();  System.out.print(\"Minute  \");  double min1 = in.nextDouble();  hrTotal += hrs1;  minTotal += min1;}//calculate averagedouble avgHr1 = hrTotal/numOfTimes;double timeMin1 = Math.round(minTotal/numOfTimes);DecimalFormat df = new DecimalFormat(\"###\");String hours = df.format(avgHr1);String minutes = df.format(timeMin1);String time = hours+\":\"+minutes+\":\"+00;String mt = hours+minutes;    SimpleDateFormat fmtMil = new SimpleDateFormat(\"HH:mm:ss\");    Date inDate = fmtMil.parse(time, new ParsePosition(0));    SimpleDateFormat fmtAMPM = new SimpleDateFormat(\"hh:mm:ss aa\");    StringBuffer outDate = fmtAMPM.format(inDate, new StringBuffer(), new FieldPosition(0));System.out.println(\"\\nThe average time is \" + outDate+\"\\n\"+mt+\" in military time.\\n\\n\");    String copy = \"Copying...\";    Thread.sleep( 550 );    for( int i = 0; i < copy.length(); i++ ) {        System.out.print(copy.charAt( i ) );         try{ Thread.sleep( 105 ); }catch( Exception e ){}        }        PrintWriter p = new PrintWriter(\"Times.txt\");           p.println(hrs1+min1);            p.close();        System.out.println(\"\\nDone\\n\\n\\n\");            Thread.sleep( 550 );  }}I want it to export to a file the times entered by the user. For example if the user sets the numOfTimes to be 2, I will have 2 different values for hrs1 and min1.Say they enter: 1629 and 2018.I want the text file to display the hrs1 (16) and the min1 (29) just like 1629. But instead of the 'hrs1+min1' when I put hrs1+min1 it just exports '0.0'. I just want it to export \"1629\" and \"2018\".Why is this and how do I fix it?OutputHow many times? 2Enter time in military time notation: Hour  16Minute  29Enter time in military time notation: Hour  20Minute  18What should be exported:16292018\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
