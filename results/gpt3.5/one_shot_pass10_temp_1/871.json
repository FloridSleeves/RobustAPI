It is recommended to use a single instance of SQLiteOpenHelper throughout your application to manage database operations efficiently.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use SQLiteOpenHelper in multiple activities:\n\n1. Create a subclass of SQLiteOpenHelper, let's call it MyDatabaseHelper, and implement the necessary methods:\n\npublic class MyDatabaseHelper extends SQLiteOpenHelper {\n    private static final String DATABASE_NAME = \"my_database\";\n    private static final int DATABASE_VERSION = 1;\n\n    public MyDatabaseHelper(Context context) {\n        super(context, DATABASE_NAME, null, DATABASE_VERSION);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onCreate(SQLiteDatabase db) {\n        // Create your database tables here\n        // Example: db.execSQL(\"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS my_table (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT)\");\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onUpgrade(SQLiteDatabase db, int oldVersion, int newVersion) {\n        // Handle database upgrades here\n    }\n}\n\n2. In your activities, create a single instance of MyDatabaseHelper and use it to access the database:\n\npublic class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {\n    private MyDatabaseHelper dbHelper;\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n\n        dbHelper = new MyDatabaseHelper(this);\n        SQLiteDatabase db = dbHelper.getWritableDatabase();\n\n        // Perform database operations here\n\n        db.close(); // Close the database\n    }\n}\n\npublic class SecondActivity extends AppCompatActivity {\n    private MyDatabaseHelper dbHelper;\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n        setContentView(R.layout.activity_second);\n\n        dbHelper = new MyDatabaseHelper(this);\n        SQLiteDatabase db = dbHelper.getWritableDatabase();\n\n        // Perform database operations here\n\n        db.close(); // Close the database\n    }\n}\n\nBy closing the database at the end of each activity, you ensure that the resources are released and there are no unnecessary open connections.\n\nIt is considered a good practice to close the database after every modification.
