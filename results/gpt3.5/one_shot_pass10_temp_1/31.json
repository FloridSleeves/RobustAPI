The error is occurring at line 28 of MainActivity.java.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you need to initialize the views (gob1, gob2, lb, plb, and prb) using findViewById before setting the onClickListeners. Make sure that the ids used in findViewById match the ids specified in your layout XML files.\n\nHere's an example of how you can initialize the views and set the onClickListeners:\n\n@Override\npublic void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n\n    // Initialize views\n    Button gob1 = (Button) findViewById(R.id.gob1);\n    Button gob2 = (Button) findViewById(R.id.gob2);\n    Button lb = (Button) findViewById(R.id.lb);\n    Button plb = (Button) findViewById(R.id.plb);\n    Button prb = (Button) findViewById(R.id.prb);\n\n    // Set onClickListeners\n    gob1.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener(){\n        @Override\n        public void onClick(View p1)\n        {\n            //setContentView(R.layout.main);\n        }\n    });\n    gob2.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener(){\n        @Override\n        public void onClick(View p1)\n        {\n            //setContentView(R.layout.main);//change to play when finished\n        }\n    });\n    lb.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener(){\n        @Override\n        public void onClick(View p1)\n        {\n            //setContentView(R.layout.learn);\n        }\n    });\n    plb.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener(){\n        @Override\n        public void onClick(View p1)\n        {\n            //setContentView(R.layout.main);//change to play\n        }\n    });\n    prb.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener(){\n        @Override\n        public void onClick(View p1)\n        {\n            //setContentView(R.layout.main);//change to project\n        }\n    });\n}\n\nMake sure to replace the ids (R.id.gob1, R.id.gob2, etc.) with the actual ids used in your layout XML files.\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The crash was caused by a NullPointerException because the views (gob1, gob2, lb, plb, and prb) were not initialized before setting the onClickListeners.

I am confused how does it work? why doesn't it give error just like we get in java code? and most importantly, how does environment decide to which component it needs to invoke? I understand the process of id generation is automated, which gets added to R.java For instance, if we have same IDs, say \"image1\" in two XMLs, say \"layout1\" & \"layout2\". but in R.java it won't have 2 IDs. that means at a time it will reference only 1 component. In case we have to use 2 XMLs in an Activity, one as activity.setcontentview(layout1) and another as a PopupWindow.setContentView(layout2). What will happen in such case?\nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Activity.setContentView\n<<<code>>>: @Override\npublic void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n    Button myButton = (Button) findViewById(R.id.my_button);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You can findViewById of the current view hierarchy set to the activity.
