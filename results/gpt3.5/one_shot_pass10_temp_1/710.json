That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1.

It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: null result: :Why have I got null in the text file test3.txt after read the elements of vectors correctly?The problem is that the test1.txt consists of the string words, when I printed out the vector elements, it is OK, but when I print these elements vector to another file the other file is still null.import java.io.BufferedReader;import java.io.FileReader;import java.io.FileWriter;import java.io.IOException;import java.util.Vector;public class VectorFile {    public static void main (String args []) throws IOException    {        Vector vc = new Vector();        BufferedReader file = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"c://test1.txt\"));        FileWriter out = new FileWriter(\"c://test3.txt\");        String s;        while ((s = file.readLine()) != null) {            vc.add(s);        }        file.close();        System.out.println(vc.size());        for(int i=0; i<vc.size(); i++){            out.write( (String) vc.get(i));            }    }}\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
