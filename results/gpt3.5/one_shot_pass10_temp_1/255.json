It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Read input stream twice: :How do you read the same inputstream twice? Is it possible to copy it somehow?I need to get a image from web, save it locally and then return the saved image.
