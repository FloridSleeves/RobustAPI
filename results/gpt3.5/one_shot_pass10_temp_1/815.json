In your code, you are closing the socket in the \"finally\" block, which is a good practice to ensure that the socket is always closed even if an exception occurs. However, you should make sure to wrap the \"client.close()\" statement in a try-catch block to handle any potential IOExceptions that may occur during the closing process."

This will ensure that the input connection is properly closed and the warning will not appear in the logCat."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Transmit and Receive Socket Implementation in Android: :I am currently developing socket communication between android and server, which is a simple java program run in terminal. Things are going well except there is a warning always appears in the logCat when I close the application:  IInputConnectionWrapper    showStatusIcon on inactive InputConnectionI am searching on the internet to find out the problem I found a post in StackOverflow Similar Problem. The difference is that I can send and receive information well in my program. The answer to this similar problem is that connection is not closed. Does that mean I didn't call socket.close(); after operation? That leads to a more complicated problem of implementation. First of all,  I want a single, static socket to listen and send to a server. Because I might not close the socket every time I transmit something, so I just close it after the listener finishes the work.Detail codes are posted belowI initialize connection in the constructor as:client = new Socket(mServerName, mport);out = new DataOutputStream(client.getOutputStream()); inFromServer = new InputStreamReader(client.getInputStream());reader = new BufferedReader(inFromServer);And let them be there during the whole process.I wrote transmitting from android to server into a function as following:public void sendRequest(int type, int what1, int what2, Object data){    try{        if(client.isConnected())        {            out.writeUTF(encoded(type,what1,what2,data) + \"\\n\");                    }    }catch(IOException e){        Log.e(TAG, \"IOException at SendRequest\");        e.printStackTrace();    }}Listener in a new thread:try {               String line = null;        while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null)        {            ReceiveHandler(line);        }    } catch (IOException e) {        Log.e(TAG, \"IOException at StartListen\");        e.printStackTrace();    }finally{        try {          // The Only Place that I close the Socket            inFromServer.close();            out.close();            reader.close();            client.close();        } catch (IOException e) {            Log.e(TAG, \"Close Socket with IOException \" + e.toString());            e.printStackTrace();        }     }My Question is:Is there something wrong with my implementation or are there better ways to do this?Thanks so much for your help!\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
