However, Java only allows you to use a wildcard with \"extends\". If you want your iterator to always return a subtype of Maple, you can use \"extends\" in the generic declaration. Then, in the next() method, you can cast the Maple object to type T before returning it. This will allow you to use the iterator with different subclass types of Maple while ensuring type safety."
