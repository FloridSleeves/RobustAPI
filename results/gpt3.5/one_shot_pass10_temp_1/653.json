When you retrieve the value using `data.get(somekey)` and cast it to `String`, it is causing a `ClassCastException` because the actual type of the value stored in the map is not a `String`. To fix this issue, you can cast the value to `Object` first and then convert it to the desired type (e.g., `String`) using the appropriate conversion method (e.g., `.toString()`). Here's an updated code snippet that should work on all Android versions:\n\nHashMap<Somekey, Object> data = new HashMap<Somekey, Object>();\ndata.put(somekey, \"asdfdsafdsf\");\nObject value = data.get(somekey);\nString stringValue = value != null ? value.toString() : null;\n\nBy using `value.toString()`, you ensure that the value is converted to a `String` regardless of its actual type, preventing the `ClassCastException` from occurring."

In your code, you have declared your HashMap as HashMap<Somekey, Object>, where the value type is Object. When you retrieve the value using data.get(somekey), the return type is Object. In some cases, the actual value stored in the map might not match the expected type, resulting in a ClassCastException when you try to cast it to the desired type (e.g., String, Integer, Double). To avoid this error, you can perform an additional check before casting the value. For example, you can use the instanceof operator to check if the value is of the desired type before casting it, like this:\n\nHashMap<Somekey, Object> data = new HashMap<Somekey, Object>();\ndata.put(somekey, \"asdfdsafdsf\");\nObject value = data.get(somekey);\n\nif (value instanceof String) {\n    String stringValue = (String) value;\n    // Process the string value\n} else {\n   // Handle the case where the value is not a String\n}\n\nBy performing this check, you can safely cast the value to the desired type without encountering a ClassCastException. Additionally, it's important to note that this issue might be specific to certain versions of Android due to differences in the Java runtime environment."
