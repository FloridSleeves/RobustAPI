How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: How to execute cmd commands via Java: :I am trying to execute command line arguments via Java. For example:// Execute commandString command = \"cmd /c start cmd.exe\";Process child = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(command);// Get output stream to write from itOutputStream out = child.getOutputStream();out.write(\"cd C:/ /r/n\".getBytes());out.flush();out.write(\"dir /r/n\".getBytes());out.close();The above opens the command line but does not execute cd or dir. Any ideas? I am running Windows XP, JRE6.(I have revised my question to be more specific. The following answers were helpful but do not answer my question.)\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
