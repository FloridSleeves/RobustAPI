However, there is no built-in mechanism for programmatically releasing the lock on the underlying collection object.\n\nIf you need more control over the synchronization mechanism, you can create your own wrapper class that encapsulates the iterable collection and provides methods for synchronized access. Here is an example implementation:\n\n```java\npublic class SynchronizedIterable<T> implements Iterable<T> {\n    private Iterable<T> collection;\n\n    public SynchronizedIterable(Iterable<T> collection) {\n        this.collection = collection;\n    }\n\n    public synchronized void finish() {\n        // Method that releases the lock on the underlying collection\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public synchronized Iterator<T> iterator() {\n        return collection.iterator();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou can use this wrapper class to synchronize access to the collection and call the `finish()` method to release the lock when you are done. Note that synchronization is done by using the `synchronized` keyword on the methods that require synchronized access.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that using the concurrent collections provided by the `java.util.concurrent` package, such as `ConcurrentHashMap` or `CopyOnWriteArrayList`, may be a better fit for your requirements if you need thread-safe access to the collection. These concurrent collections handle synchronization internally and provide better performance in multi-threaded scenarios."
