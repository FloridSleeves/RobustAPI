But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: when is servlet response committed or flushed?: :According to javadoc:in-request.getRequestDispatcher(\"/Test\").forward(request,response);forward should be called before the response has been committed to the  client (before response body output has been flushed).Uncommitted output in the response buffer is automatically cleared before the forward.I am getting confused when this response is committed or been flushed?is this writing in println of printwriter.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
