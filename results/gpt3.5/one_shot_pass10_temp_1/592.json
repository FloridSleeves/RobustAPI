Unlike ArrayList, arrays are not dynamically resizable, so concurrent modifications are not an issue. However, if multiple threads access and modify the same array element concurrently without proper synchronization, then it can lead to unpredictable and incorrect results. To ensure thread safety in scenarios where multiple threads are modifying the same array elements, proper synchronization mechanisms (such as using synchronized blocks or using thread-safe data structures) should be implemented."
