But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Output text to a file with a class method java: :I have a valet class method that should write an hourly wage to a file:public void hourlyOverall() throws FileNotFoundException{    PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(\"wage info\");    new FileOutputStream(\"wage info\", true);    hourlyOverall = tips / hours + hourlyWage;    out.println(hourlyOverall);}However, when I run valet.hourlyOverall() in my main method, the file \"wage info\" is created but nothing is written to it.  What am I doing wrong?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
