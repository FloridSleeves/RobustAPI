As a result, only the first line is printed to the output file and the rest are not written. Moving the `out.close()` outside of the for loop will fix this problem. Additionally, it's a good practice to add exception handling around file operations, so you can catch and handle any potential errors that may occur."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Inputting a sorted file, unsorting it, then outputting the unsorted file (Java): :This project is supposed to have 3 separate main classes. It inputs a file of a list of countries that is sorted alphabetically, it outputs an unsorted file with lines rearranged randomly.My first main class looks like this:package assignment3;import java.io.PrintWriter;import java.io.File;import java.util.Scanner;public class Assignment3 {`public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception{    Scanner stdIn = new Scanner(new File(\"C:/Users/Vicki/Desktop/CountrySortedFormat.txt\"));    PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(\"C:/Users/Vicki/Desktop/CountryUnsortedFormat.txt\");    String[] line = new String[238];    while (stdIn.hasNextLine()){            for (int k = 0; k <= line.length-1; k++){            line[k]=stdIn.nextLine();            out.println(line[k]);            out.close();        }    }  }}My code doesn't have any visible problems but I tried printing out the array and got an array of \"null\". Am I doing something wrong?EDIT: changed PrintWriter file name to CountryUnsortedFormat\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
