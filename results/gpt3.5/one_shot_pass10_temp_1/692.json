The PrintWriter.write API is used for writing raw bytes or characters to a stream, not for reading or modifying files. For reading a file, you can use classes like FileReader, BufferedReader, or Scanner. For writing a file, you can use classes like FileWriter or BufferedWriter.\n\nTo address your second question about PrintWriter, it is a class in Java that provides convenient methods for writing formatted text to a character-output stream. It can be used to write data to files, network sockets, or any other output stream.\n\nHere is an example of how to use PrintWriter to write to a file:\n\n```\ntry (PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(\"output.txt\"))) {\n    writer.println(\"Hello, World!\");\n    writer.println(\"This is a line written using PrintWriter.\");\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, a PrintWriter is created with a FileWriter, specifying the file path \"output.txt\". The `println` method is then used to write lines of text to the file. The try-with-resources statement is used to automatically close the PrintWriter after it is done writing.\n\nI hope this helps clarify how PrintWriter can be used for writing files in Java."

For reading a file I know you can use Scanner and read it and then print it. However reading a file and then printing it in a new format, like double space, indents, basically any spacing issues, is that also considered reading it or is it writing it? From my understanding of what my teacher has taught me, is that writing overwrites the original document and replaces it. Also how does one use the PrintWriter command? I have never seen this before in my class nor have read about it in my textbook but its on my test according to my teacher. Could someone give an explanation and an example about it? I read this site http://www.caveofprogramming.com/frontpage/articles/java/java-file-reading-and-writing-files-in-java/ on writing files, but it uses FileWriter, which I'm assuming takes the place of scanner? Is that right?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
