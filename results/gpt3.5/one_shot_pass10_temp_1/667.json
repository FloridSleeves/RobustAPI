The `params` hash contains the parameters sent in the request body, and you can access the value of the `text` parameter using `params[:text]`.

The Sinatra server can then access this parameter using `params[:text]`. You can perform any necessary processing on the received data within the route handler.\n\nNote that in the Sinatra code above, I've used the `post` method to define the route because your Java client is sending data using HTTP POST. If you are using a different HTTP method, you would need to use the corresponding method in Sinatra (`get`, `put`, `delete`, etc.) to define the route."
