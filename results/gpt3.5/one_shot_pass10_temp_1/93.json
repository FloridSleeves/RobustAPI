The write method is used to write raw bytes to the output stream, and it does not have the ability to add trailers to the chunked response.\n\nTo send HTTP trailers/footers in a chunked response from within a Java servlet, you will need to use a different approach. One possible solution is to use a library like Apache HttpClient, which provides better support for working with HTTP requests and responses.\n\nHere is an example of how you can send HTTP trailers/footers using Apache HttpClient:\n\n```java\nimport org.apache.http.HttpEntity;\nimport org.apache.http.HttpResponse;\nimport org.apache.http.client.methods.HttpPost;\nimport org.apache.http.entity.StringEntity;\nimport org.apache.http.impl.client.CloseableHttpClient;\nimport org.apache.http.impl.client.HttpClients;\nimport org.apache.http.protocol.HTTP;\nimport org.apache.http.protocol.HttpContext;\nimport org.apache.http.protocol.HttpCoreContext;\n\nCloseableHttpClient httpClient = HttpClients.createDefault();\nString url = \"your_url_here\";\n\ntry {\n    HttpPost httpPost = new HttpPost(url);\n\n    // Create the request entity and add it to the HTTP post\n    StringEntity requestEntity = new StringEntity(\"your_request_body_here\", ContentType.APPLICATION_JSON);\n    httpPost.setEntity(requestEntity);\n\n    // Set the trailer headers\n    httpPost.addHeader(HTTP.TRANSFER_ENCODING, HTTP.CHUNK_CODING);\n    httpPost.addHeader(HTTP.TRAILER, \"SomeTrailer\");\n\n    // Send the HTTP request\n    HttpResponse response = httpClient.execute(httpPost, createHttpContext());\n\n    // Handle the response here...\n} finally {\n    // Close the HTTP client\n    httpClient.close();\n}\n\nprivate HttpContext createHttpContext() {\n    // Create the HttpContext to handle the response and trailers\n    HttpCoreContext context = HttpCoreContext.create();\n    context.setAttribute(HttpCoreContext.HTTP_RESPONSE_FACTORY, DefaultHttpResponseFactory.INSTANCE);\n    context.setAttribute(HttpCoreContext.HTTP_CONNECTION, new DummyConnection());\n\n    return context;\n}\n\nprivate static class DummyConnection extends DefaultBHttpServerConnection {\n    @Override\n    public void sendResponseHeader(HttpResponse response) throws HttpException, IOException {\n        super.sendResponseHeader(response);\n        response.addHeader(HTTP.TRAILER, \"SomeTrailer\");\n        datastream.writeBytes(\"SomeTrailer: [value]\");\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void flush() throws IOException {\n        super.flush();\n        ensureHeadersWritten();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that this example uses the Apache HttpClient library, which is an external library and needs to be included in your project. You can add the library to your project by including the appropriate JAR file(s) or by using a dependency management tool like Maven or Gradle.\n\nAlso, make sure to replace \"your_url_here\" with the actual URL you want to send the request to, and \"your_request_body_here\" with the actual request body you want to send.\n\nI hope this helps!
