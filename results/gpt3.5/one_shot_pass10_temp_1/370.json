By definition, a set does not allow duplicate elements, and the order of elements in a set is not guaranteed. Therefore, it doesn't make sense to have a get() method to retrieve an element at a specific index, as there is no defined ordering in a set.\n\nIf you need to retrieve a specific element from a set, you can use an iterator or convert the set to a list and then access the element using an index. However, it's important to note that converting a set to a list removes the uniqueness constraint, and the order of elements may still not be the same as the original set.\n\nIf you require both uniqueness and the ability to access elements by index, you can use a java.util.List instead of a set.

Another option is to convert the Set to a List using the constructor of ArrayList or any other List implementation, and then use the get(int index) method.\n\nIf you need to access elements by index frequently, you should consider using a List rather than a Set.

(other than using an iterator)I'm sure the fact that it's excluded from the API means there's a good reason for not doing this -- could someone please enlighten me?EDIT:Some extremely great answers here, and a few saying \"more context\".  The specific scenario was a dbUnit test, where I could reasonably assert that the returned set from a query had only 1 item, and I was trying to access that item.However, the question is more valid without the scenario, as it remains more focussed:What's the difference between set and list.Thanks to all for the fantastic answers below.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
