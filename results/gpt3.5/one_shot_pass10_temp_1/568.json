HashSet provides constant time performance for add, contains, and remove operations.\nHere's an example of how you can use HashSet for your snake game:\nSet<Cell> unoccupiedCells = new HashSet<>();\n\n// Add cells\nunoccupiedCells.add(cell1);\nunoccupiedCells.add(cell2);\nunoccupiedCells.add(cell3);\n\n// Get random cell\nCell randomCell = getRandomElement(unoccupiedCells);\n\n// Remove a cell\nunoccupiedCells.remove(cell2);\n\n// Helper method to get random element from the set\nprivate <T> T getRandomElement(Collection<T> collection) {\n    int randomIndex = new Random().nextInt(collection.size());\n    Iterator<T> iterator = collection.iterator();\n    for (int i = 0; i < randomIndex; i++) {\n        iterator.next();\n    }\n    return iterator.next();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: HashSet provides constant time performance for add, contains, and remove operations, as it uses hashing to store elements. When you add an element, it calculates the hash code and uses it to determine the position in the internal array where the element should be stored. When you retrieve an element, it calculates the hash code and uses it to quickly find the element in the array. When you remove an element, it also calculates the hash code and removes the element from the array. Therefore, HashSet is the most efficient collection for fast add, get, and removal of random elements."
