If you don't set the toolbar, the getSupportActionBar() method will return null, causing a NullPointerException when you try to access its methods. Make sure to add a Toolbar to your layout XML file with a unique ID, and then call setSupportActionBar() passing in the Toolbar instance."

I am confused how does it work? why doesn't it give error just like we get in java code? and most importantly, how does environment decide to which component it needs to invoke? I understand the process of id generation is automated, which gets added to R.java For instance, if we have same IDs, say \"image1\" in two XMLs, say \"layout1\" & \"layout2\". but in R.java it won't have 2 IDs. that means at a time it will reference only 1 component. In case we have to use 2 XMLs in an Activity, one as activity.setcontentview(layout1) and another as a PopupWindow.setContentView(layout2). What will happen in such case?\nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Activity.setContentView\n<<<code>>>: @Override\npublic void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n    Button myButton = (Button) findViewById(R.id.my_button);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You can findViewById of the current view hierarchy set to the activity. You cannot have same id for the view's in the same view tree. (must be unique).\nQuestion: NullPointerExcetption with AppCompat and ActionBar: :The Activity I have crashes everytime with this error. If I add any code related to getSupportActionBar() it crashes within that.
