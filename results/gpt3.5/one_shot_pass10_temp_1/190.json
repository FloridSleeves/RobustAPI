The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Java create InputStream from ZipInputStream entry: :I would like to write a method that read several XML files inside a ZIP, from a single InputStream.The method would open a ZipInputStream, and on each xml file, get the corresponding InputStream, and give it to my XML parser. Here is the skeleton of the method : private void readZip(InputStream is) throws IOException {    ZipInputStream zis = new ZipInputStream(is);    ZipEntry entry = zis.getNextEntry();    while (entry != null) {        if (entry.getName().endsWith(\".xml\")) {            // READ THE STREAM        }        entry = zis.getNextEntry();    }}The problematic part is the \"// READ THE STREAM\". I have a working solution, which consist to create a ByteArrayInputStream, and feed my parser with it. But it uses a buffer, and for large files I get an OutOfMemoryError. Here is the code, if someone is still interested :int count;byte buffer[] = new byte[2048];ByteArrayOutputStream out = new ByteArrayOutputStream();while ((count = zis.read(buffer)) != -1) { out.write(buffer, 0, count); }       InputStream is = new ByteArrayInputStream(out.toByteArray());The ideal solution would be to feed the parser with the original ZipInputStream. It should works, because it works if I just print the entry content with a Scanner :Scanner sc = new Scanner(zis);while (sc.hasNextLine()){    System.out.println(sc.nextLine());}But... The parser I'm currently using (jdom2, but I also tried with javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory) closes the stream after parsing the data :/ . So I'm unable to get the next entry and continue.So finally the question is :Does anybody know a DOM parser that doesn't close its stream ?Is there another way to have an InputStream from a ZipEntry ?Thanks.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
