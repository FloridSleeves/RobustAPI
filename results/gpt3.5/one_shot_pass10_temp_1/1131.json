You are trying to use an InputStreamReader together with a BufferedReader. However, it is not necessary to use an InputStreamReader here because FileReader already reads the file as characters. You can directly pass FileReader to BufferedReader.\n\n2. When reading from the file, you should use the readLine() method of BufferedReader to read each line of the file. This will give you the entire line as a String.\n\n3. In your original code, you are using fr.read() to read from the file, but this method only reads a single character at a time. Instead, you should use BufferedReader's readLine() method to read the entire line.\n\n4. Finally, make sure to close the BufferedReader in the finally block to release any system resources it is using."
