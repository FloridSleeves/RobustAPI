(and this is Pseudo code)....once sprite has fallen and it's Y position has been reset back to the top of the screen:spriteX = value_held_in_next_arrayList_position(if_there_is_one)As different levels of my game will have a different number of positions I can't explicitly say 'go to position 2' incase the arrayList is only a size of 1.  Basically what I want is to say 'go to next position' and 'if there isn't a next position' then go back to the position 0.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
