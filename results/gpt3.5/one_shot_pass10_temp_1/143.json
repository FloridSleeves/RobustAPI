The DocumentFile class is used to access files/documents through the ContentProvider API. However, you can achieve random access functionality by using the RandomAccessFile class along with a temporary file.\n\nYou can create a temporary file using `File.createTempFile()` and then copy the contents of the DocumentFile to the temporary file. Once you have the temporary file, you can create a RandomAccessFile from it.\n\nHere's an example of how you can achieve this:\n\n```\nDocumentFile documentFile = // Your DocumentFile\n\ntry {\n    File tempFile = File.createTempFile(\"temp\", null);\n    InputStream inputStream = getContentResolver().openInputStream(documentFile.getUri());\n    OutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream(tempFile);\n\n    byte[] buffer = new byte[4096];\n    int bytesRead;\n    while ((bytesRead = inputStream.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n        outputStream.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);\n    }\n\n    outputStream.close();\n    inputStream.close();\n\n    // Now you can use the RandomAccessFile with the tempFile\n    RandomAccessFile randomAccessFile = new RandomAccessFile(tempFile, \"r\");\n\n    // Perform random access operations using randomAccessFile\n\n    // Clean up the temporary file when done\n    tempFile.delete();\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n```\n\nNote that this approach involves creating a temporary file on the device's storage, so make sure to handle file cleanup appropriately."

I wrote objects at various locations in the file. The objects were of variable sizes but all of the same class.Now I want to read from such a file. I dont want to have to specify the number of bytes to read. I want to be able to read the object directly using Object Input Stream. How to achieve this ? I have to use Random Access Files because I need to write to different positions in file. I am also recording in a separate data structure, the locations where objects have been written.\nPlease using this api: FileChannel.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileChannel.write\n<<<code>>>: while(rbb.hasRemaining()) {\n        try{\n            fileChannel.writeLong(recordBytes.length);\n            fileChannel.write(rbb);\n        } catch {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");}\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The simplest solution that comes to mind is to write out the length of the array before writing out the array itself. When reading the object, you first read the length. This'll tell you how many further bytes to read to get your object. Similarly to what you are already doing on the writing side, you could read the data into a byte[] and then use ByteArrayInputputStream and ObjectInputStream.\nQuestion: DocumentFile RandomAccessFile: :Is there any way get a RandomAccessFile from a given DocumentFile?I know it is possible to get an InputStream via getUriInputStream inputStream = getContentResolver().openInputStream(DocumentFile.getUri());But I need a RandomAccessFileThanks for your help,Jens\nPlease using this api: FileChannel.write.\nAnswer:"
