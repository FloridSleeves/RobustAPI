I am confused how does it work? why doesn't it give error just like we get in java code? and most importantly, how does environment decide to which component it needs to invoke? I understand the process of id generation is automated, which gets added to R.java For instance, if we have same IDs, say \"image1\" in two XMLs, say \"layout1\" & \"layout2\". but in R.java it won't have 2 IDs. that means at a time it will reference only 1 component. In case we have to use 2 XMLs in an Activity, one as activity.setcontentview(layout1) and another as a PopupWindow.setContentView(layout2). What will happen in such case?\nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Activity.setContentView\n<<<code>>>: @Override\npublic void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n    Button myButton = (Button) findViewById(R.id.my_button);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You can findViewById of the current view hierarchy set to the activity. You cannot have same id for the view's in the same view tree. (must be unique).\nQuestion: Why when I make a new instance of text view outside of a method the program compiles but crashes?: :Inside one of my java files I have to use this new instance of a TextView in two separate methods, so rather than creating the new instances of the TextView in both methods I thought I would just declare it outside of the methods although still inside the class. I didn't receive any errors before compiling however when I tried to get to the activity this class is concerned with the app crashes. I fixed this by putting the declaration in both separate methods and the app stopped crashing I was just wondering why and would there be a more eloquent way of doing it as I'm trying to stick to the DRY principle.
