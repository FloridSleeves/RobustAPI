You are initializing the iterator `iter` before `webster` collection is populated, so the iterator doesn't have any elements to iterate over. To fix this, you need to move the initialization of the iterator inside the `writer()` method after the collection is populated. Additionally, you need to store the value returned by `iter.next()` in a variable and then use that variable to print the word to the output file."
