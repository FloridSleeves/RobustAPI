Here is an example of how you can send data to a specific client based on its IP address:\n\n1. Create a class-level field to store the list of connected clients and their IP addresses:\n   private static Map<String, Socket> connectedClients = new HashMap<>();\n\n2. Inside the while loop where you accept new client connections, add the connected client to the map:\n   Socket s = server.accept();\n   InetAddress clientAddress = s.getInetAddress();\n   connectedClients.put(clientAddress.getHostAddress(), s);\n\n3. To send data to a specific client, retrieve the socket corresponding to its IP address and use DataOutputStream to send the data:\n   String targetIP = \"192.168.0.100\"; // replace with the actual IP of the target client\n   Socket targetSocket = connectedClients.get(targetIP);\n   DataOutputStream out = new DataOutputStream(targetSocket.getOutputStream());\n   out.writeBytes(\"Hello client!\"); // replace with the actual data you want to send\n\n4. Don't forget to close the resources after sending the data:\n   out.flush();\n   out.close();\n   targetSocket.close();\n\nNote: Remember to handle exceptions and error conditions appropriately in your code.\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The code provided demonstrates how to send data to a specific client in a multi-client server scenario.

When you want to send data to a specific client, you can retrieve the Socket object from the map using the identifier and then send data to that client using the Socket's output stream.\n\nNote that this is a simplified example and doesn't handle cases such as clients disconnecting or multiple clients with the same identifier. You may need to modify it further based on your specific requirements.\n```\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The code snippet above shows how you can modify your server code to send data to a specific client.
