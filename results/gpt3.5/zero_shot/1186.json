It uses the `StringTokenizer` class to tokenize each string and convert the tokens into integers. The integers are then stored in a 2D array `a`.\n\nThe outer loop iterates `n1` times, which represents the number of rows. In each iteration, a new string `s2` is read and a new `StringTokenizer` `st1` is created to tokenize the string.\n\nThe inner loop iterates `n2` times, which represents the number of columns. In each iteration, the next token from `st1` is parsed as an integer using `Integer.parseInt()` and stored in the corresponding position of the 2D array `a`.\n\nNote that the code assumes that `bure` is an instance of `BufferedReader` used to read the input strings."

Closed 10 years ago.I have a set of 3 strings, each in different lines, which are integers separated by spaces.1 1 23 4 44 5 5I wanted to input them into a character array, and I used StringTokenizer in this manner:for(int j=0;i<n1;i++){  s2=bure.readLine();           st1=new StringTokenizer(s2);  for(int k=0;k<n2;k++){    a[j][k]=Integer.parseInt(st1.nextToken());  }      }Where n1 and n2 are the number of rows and columns.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
