This means that when you retrieve a value from the HashMap using the get() method, it does not perform any type checking and simply returns the value as an Object.\n\nIn your case, when you retrieve the value using data.get(somekey), it returns a Boolean object instead of a String object. This is because the HashMap does not have any knowledge of the type of the value that was originally stored.\n\nTo fix this issue, you can explicitly cast the retrieved value to the desired type. In your code, you are trying to cast the retrieved value to a String using (String) data.get(somekey). However, since the actual value is a Boolean, this will result in a ClassCastException.\n\nTo avoid this, you should check the type of the retrieved value before casting it. You can use the instanceof operator to check the type and then perform the appropriate cast. Here's an example:\n\nObject value = data.get(somekey);\nif (value instanceof String) {\n    String stringValue = (String) value;\n    // Use stringValue as a String\n} else {\n    // Handle the case where the value is not a String\n}\n\nBy performing this type check, you can ensure that you only cast the value to the correct type and avoid any ClassCastException."

This error appears not only with String type, with Integer and Double too.I don't understand why, because this code correctly works on android 4.0.3 and higher.\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:"
