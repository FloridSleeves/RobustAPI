By doing this, you can ensure that the read method does not block indefinitely and you can handle the situation appropriately.\n\nIn the provided code, a while loop is used to continuously read from the InputStream until the end of the stream is reached. The bytesRead variable stores the number of bytes read from the stream in each iteration. If bytesRead is -1, it means that the end of the stream has been reached and the loop can be exited.\n\nInside the loop, you can process the data read from the input stream according to your requirements.\n\nIf an IOException is thrown during the read operation, it means that an error occurred while reading from the stream. You can handle this exception by catching it and taking appropriate action, such as logging the error or retrying the operation.\n\nFinally, it is important to close the InputStream in a finally block to ensure that system resources are properly released, even if an exception occurs."

However if my network goes down the the process of reading the file the read method blocks and is never recovers if the network reappears. I was wondering how I should handle this case and should some exception not be thrown if the InputStream goes away. Code is like this. Url someUrl = new Url(\"http://somefile.com\");InputStream inputStream = someUrl.openStream();byte[] byteArray = new byte[];int size = 1024;inputStream.read(byteArray,0,size);So somewhere after calling read the network goes down and the read method blocks. How can i deal with this situation as the read doesn't seem to throw an exception. \nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
