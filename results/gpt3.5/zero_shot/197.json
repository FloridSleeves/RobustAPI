This method should contain the code to establish the SSH connection and return the InputStream object.\n\nNext, we use a while loop to read data from the SSH connection. The read() method returns an integer representing the next byte of data, or -1 if the end of the stream is reached. We process the data as needed (in this example, we simply print it to the console).\n\nFinally, we call the closeSSHConnection() method to close the SSH connection. This method should contain the code to close the SSH connection.\n\nNote: The code provided is a basic example and does not include the actual implementation of the SSH connection. You will need to replace the placeholder methods (getSSHInputStream() and closeSSHConnection()) with your own code to establish and close the SSH connection."
