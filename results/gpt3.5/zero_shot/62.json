Then, create a new `Document` object for each line and add a new `Field` with the name \"word\" and the line as the value. You can also add the baseLetters field in a similar way. Finally, add the document to the `IndexWriter` using `indexWriter.addDocument(dictionary)`. This will add each line from the dictionary file as a separate document in the Lucene index.\n\nRegarding your second question, if you register `DocumentIndexer` as a bean in Spring, the index will not be created/appended every time you redeploy your webapp. The index will only be created/appended when you explicitly call the `createIndex()` method. Similarly, the `DictionarySearcher` will not create a new index every time you redeploy the webapp. The index will remain the same unless you explicitly recreate it."

It is a simple dictionary file encoded 1250 with 2.8 million lines in it. Every line has only one unique word:catdoggod...I want to use Lucene to search for every anagram in dictionary of specific word. For example:I want to search every anagram of the word dog and lucene should search my dictionary and return dog and god. In my webapp I have a Word Entity:public class Word {    private Long id;    private String word;    private String baseLetters;    private String definition;}and baseLetters is the variable which are sorted letters alphabetically for searching such anagrams [god and dog words will have the same baseLetters: dgo]. I succeeded in searching such anagrams from my database using this baseLetters variable in different service but I have problem to create index of my dictionary file. I know I have to add to fields:word and baseLetters but I have no idea how to do it :( Could someone show me some directions to achieve this goal?For now I have only something like that:public class DictionaryIndexer {private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(DictionaryIndexer.class);@Value(\"${dictionary.path}\")private String dictionaryPath;@Value(\"${lucene.search.indexDir}\")private String indexPath;public void createIndex() throws CorruptIndexException, LockObtainFailedException {    try {        IndexWriter indexWriter = getLuceneIndexer();        createDocument();               } catch (IOException e) {        logger.error(e.getMessage(), e);    }        }private IndexWriter getLuceneIndexer() throws CorruptIndexException, LockObtainFailedException, IOException {    StandardAnalyzer analyzer = new StandardAnalyzer(Version.LUCENE_36);    IndexWriterConfig indexWriterConfig = new IndexWriterConfig(Version.LUCENE_36, analyzer);    indexWriterConfig.setOpenMode(OpenMode.CREATE_OR_APPEND);    Directory directory = new SimpleFSDirectory(new File(indexPath));    return new IndexWriter(directory, indexWriterConfig);}private void createDocument() throws FileNotFoundException {    File sjp = new File(dictionaryPath);    Reader reader = new FileReader(sjp);    Document dictionary = new Document();    dictionary.add(new Field(\"word\", reader));}}PS: One more question. If i register DocumentIndexer as a bean in Spring will the index be creating/appending every time I redeploy my webapp? and the same will be with the future DictionarySearcher?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:"
