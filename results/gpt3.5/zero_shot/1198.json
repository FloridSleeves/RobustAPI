To fix this, you can use `StringTokenizer.nextToken()` instead of `Scanner.next()` to read each word from the sentence. Here's the modified code:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\nimport java.io.FileNotFoundException;\nimport java.io.File;\nimport java.io.PrintWriter;\nimport java.util.StringTokenizer;\n\npublic class ScannerDemo {\n    public static void main(String args[]) {\n        String c = \"\";\n        try {\n            File file = new File(args[0]);\n            Scanner scanner = new Scanner(file);\n            PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(args[1]);\n\n            while (scanner.hasNextLine()) {\n                Scanner s2 = new Scanner(scanner.nextLine());\n                String counts = s2.next();\n                int count = Integer.parseInt(counts);\n\n                while (s2.hasNext()) {\n                    for (int x = 0; x < count; x++) {\n                        s2.next();\n                    }\n                    StringTokenizer tokenizer = new StringTokenizer(s2.nextLine());\n                    while (tokenizer.hasMoreTokens()) {\n                        c += tokenizer.nextToken();\n                        c += \" \";\n                    }\n                }\n                s2.close();\n            }\n\n            scanner.close();\n            writer.println(c);\n            writer.close();\n        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this modified code, I have replaced `s2.next()` with `tokenizer.nextToken()` to read each word from the sentence. This ensures that the scanner does not try to read beyond the available tokens and eliminates the `NoSuchElementException` error."

However, now I want to switch from using the split method to another second scanner class to read each sentence to each word.import java.util.Scanner;import java.io.FileNotFoundException;import java.io.File;import java.io.PrintWriter;public class ScannerDemo{     public static void main(String args[]) {        String c = \"\";        try{            File file = new File(args[0]);            Scanner scanner = new Scanner(file);            PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(args[1]);         // as long as the scanner reads that the file has a next line               while (scanner.hasNextLine()) {        // read the first line of string in scanner s2                   Scanner s2 = new Scanner(scanner.nextLine());        // read the first word of first line from s2 as string \"counts\"                   String counts = s2.next();        // parse the string \"counts\" as int, \"count\"                   int count = Integer.parseInt(counts);        // as long as s2 has the next element                   while (s2.hasNext()){        // for loop executed \"count\" number of times to skip the words                       for (int x = 0; x < count; x ++){                           String b = s2.next();                        }       // else add the next words to string, \"c\"                           c += s2.next();                           c += \" \";                        }                    }        // close the scanner            scanner.close();        // output string \"c\" to the output file            writer.println(c);        // close the writer            writer.close();        }        catch (FileNotFoundException e) {            e.printStackTrace();  }   } }However, it gives out error messageException in thread \"main\" java.util.NoSuchElementExceptionI felt this error message is due to the second scanner class not closed properly. However, I did not figure out how to solve it after I added      s2.close();in the for loop.Any help is appreciated. Thank you but I am really new to Java, \nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
