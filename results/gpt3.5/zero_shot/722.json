First, create a PrintWriter object and specify the file name and encoding. Then, inside the while loop where you are reading the grep output, use the writer.write method to write each line to the file. Finally, close the PrintWriter to ensure that all the data is written to the file."

However, when I try to write it to a file, the file is empty.PrintWriter writer = null;writer = new PrintWriter(\"grep__output\", \"UTF-8\");writer.println(s);writer.close();Also, I tried to directly writing to file in the above while (previously creating the file), but it's the same.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
