We create a `BufferedReader` to read the ANSI encoded file using `InputStreamReader` with the encoding \"Cp1252\".\n2. We create a `PrintWriter` to write the UTF-8 encoded file using `OutputStreamWriter` with the encoding \"UTF-8\".\n3. We read each line from the ANSI encoded file and write it to the UTF-8 encoded file using `PrintWriter.write` method.\n4. After processing all the lines, we close the reader and writer.\n5. If any exception occurs during the conversion process, it will be caught and printed.\n\nMake sure to replace \"input.txt\" with the path to your ANSI encoded file and \"output.txt\" with the desired path for the UTF-8 encoded file."
