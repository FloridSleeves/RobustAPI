This can be done by calling `pdf_content.getBytes()`.\n\nTo decode the BASE64 string in Node.js, you can use the `Buffer.from()` method. Pass the BASE64 encoded string as the first argument and specify the encoding as `'base64'` in the second argument. This will create a Buffer object containing the decoded binary data.\n\nRegarding the differences you observed between the binary file on the Java side and the Node.js side, it is possible that the encoding algorithms used by Apache Commons Codec and Node.js Buffer are slightly different. The differences you observed in scattered bytes could be due to variations in the encoding process.\n\nTo ensure consistent encoding and decoding between Java and Node.js, you can try using a different BASE64 encoding library in Pentaho that is compatible with both Java and Node.js. One popular library that is widely used is `java.util.Base64` in Java, which provides encoding and decoding methods compatible with the RFC 4648 standard."

Further confusing the matter I introduced an intermediate step saving the base64Encoded string out to disk prior to decoding it.  I also then opened the original file (from the Pentaho Side) and encoded that using the Buffer(fs.readFileSync(originalPath)).toString('base64') and compared the base 64 encoded versions of each.  I was hoping to confirm that the algorithm is different (although there is no guarantee). The files themselves were the same length, and started and finished with no differences.  Scattered about the file were bunch of minor differences.  1 byte here 1 byte there.Other bits: Apache.Commons...Base64 uses \"rfc 2045\" Buffer on the Node Js side uses \"rfc 4648\" (I may be misreading the description).  Questions, Is there a known way to communicate base64 between a Java encoding and Node Js decoding?Are there other recommendation on base64 encoding in Pentaho?\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:"
