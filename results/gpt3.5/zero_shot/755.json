The PrintWriter buffers the data before sending it, so you need to explicitly flush it to ensure all the data is sent.\n\nIn the client code, after calling props.store(out, null), you can add the line out.flush() to flush the PrintWriter. This will ensure that all the data is sent to the server.\n\nOn the server side, make sure that you are reading the data from the input stream before calling props.load(in). It is possible that the data has not been fully received yet, causing the load method to hang. You can add a loop to read the data from the input stream until it is fully received before calling props.load(in).\n\nAdditionally, make sure that you are closing the streams and sockets properly after you are done with them to avoid resource leaks."

That being said, I'm stuck. Googling for java Properties over Sockets results in a lot of irrelevant things. I'm trying to transfer a Properties object over a socket. The API says it can be done with a Stream or a Writer/Reader, but I can't get it to work. I can do it manually, that is, if I read the file line by line and pass it through a PrintWriter.On the client side I've got roughly:socket = new Socket(host, port);outStream = socket.getOutputStream();out = new PrintWriter(outStream, true);in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file));...props.load(reader);props.store(out, null);On the server side the receiving bits look like:out = new PrintWriter(sock.getOutputStream(), true);inStream = sock.getInputStream();in = new BufferedReader( new InputStreamReader(inStream));...props.load(in); // hangs// doesn't get to code here...In this case it hangs at the props.load(in). Instead of doing props.load(in), I read it in line by line to make sure props.store(out, null) was working, and the data looks like its being transferred.Is there something about load/store I don't understand, or is it an issue with the Stream/Writer/Reader?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
