Create an instance of AdView and set its ad unit ID. The ad unit ID is a unique identifier for your ad placement.\n2. Create an instance of RelativeLayout, which is a layout container that allows you to position views relative to each other.\n3. Add the AdView to the RelativeLayout using the `addView()` method.\n4. Set the RelativeLayout as the content view of the activity using the `setContentView()` method.\n\nBy setting the RelativeLayout as the content view, the AdView will be displayed on top of the custom canvas. You can position the AdView within the RelativeLayout using layout parameters or by using RelativeLayout's positioning attributes."
