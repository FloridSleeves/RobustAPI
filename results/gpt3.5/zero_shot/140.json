The `write` method is synchronized to ensure that only one thread can write to the file at a time. This guarantees that the messages from multiple threads will not be mixed.\n\nThe `FileChannel.write` method is used to write the message to the file. It takes a `ByteBuffer` as input, which is created from the message string.\n\nRemember to properly handle exceptions and close the file channel and output stream when you're done using them.\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nCalling the `write` method on a `FileOutputStream` object from multiple threads without proper synchronization can lead to mixed output, as multiple threads can write to the file simultaneously. By synchronizing the `write` method, you ensure that only one thread can write to the file at a time, thus serializing the output correctly.\n\nUsing `FileChannel.write` allows you to write data to a file using a `ByteBuffer`. This method is safe to use from multiple threads as long as proper synchronization is in place.\n\nIn the provided code snippet, the `write` method is synchronized to guarantee that only one thread can write to the file at a time. The `FileChannel.write` method is then used to write the message to the file.\n\nRemember to handle exceptions properly and close the file channel and output stream when you're done using them to avoid resource leaks."

Will the output be serialized correctly?clarification:In my case the class logger holds a FileOutputStream reference, and multiple threads can call logger write, that formats the output and calls FileOutputStream write.Should I synchronize my logger write method to warrant that the messages from multiple threads are not mixed?\nPlease using this api: FileChannel.write.\nAnswer:"
