Let's say you have a list of attributes called \"groupingAttributes\".\n\nThen, you can use the Stream API to dynamically chain the GroupBy collectors based on the \"groupingAttributes\" list.\n\nHere's an example code snippet:\n\nList<String> groupingAttributes = Arrays.asList(\"name\", \"town\");\n\nMap<String, Map<String, List<Person>>> groupedData = data.stream()\n    .collect(groupingBy(p -> {\n        Iterator<String> iterator = groupingAttributes.iterator();\n        String attribute = iterator.next();\n        while (iterator.hasNext()) {\n            attribute = attribute + \"-\" + iterator.next();\n        }\n        return attribute;\n    }, groupingBy(Person::getName)));\n\nExplanation:\n1. Create a list of attributes called \"groupingAttributes\" that you want to group by dynamically.\n2. Use the Stream API to stream over the data list.\n3. Use the groupingBy collector to group the data by the first attribute in the \"groupingAttributes\" list.\n4. Use an iterator to iterate over the remaining attributes in the \"groupingAttributes\" list.\n5. Concatenate the attributes with a delimiter (e.g., \"-\") to create a dynamic key for grouping.\n6. Use the groupingBy collector again to group the data by the concatenated key.\n7. Finally, collect the grouped data into a Map.\n\nThis code snippet allows you to dynamically chain GroupBy collectors based on the \"groupingAttributes\" list. You can modify the \"groupingAttributes\" list to group by different attributes as needed."

A person have some attributes like name, country, town, zipcode, etc. I wrote the static code, which works very well:Object groupedData = data.stream().collect(groupingBy(Person::getName, Collectors.groupingBy(Person::getCountry, Collectors.groupingBy(Person::getTown))));But the problem is, that is it not dynamic. Sometimes I want to just group by name and town, sometimes by a attributes. How can I do this? Non Java 8 solutions are welcome as well.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
