However, since the iterator is iterating over a HashMap, which is a collection of key-value pairs, the returned element is of type Map.Entry. \n\nThe (Map.Entry) in front of the i.next() is a type casting operation, which is necessary to inform the compiler that the returned element should be treated as a Map.Entry object. Without the type casting, the compiler would assume that the returned element is of type Object, which does not have the necessary methods to access the key-value pair.\n\nTherefore, to access the key-value pair from the iterator, it is necessary to use (Map.Entry) to explicitly cast the returned element to the appropriate type."
