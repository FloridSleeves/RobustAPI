In your while loop condition, you have used `=` instead of `==` to check if `isJobAssigned` is false. This assignment operation will always return false, causing an infinite loop. \n\nTo fix this, change `=` to `==` in the while loop condition. Additionally, make sure to specify the generic type for the `Iterator` as `Staff` to avoid any type compatibility issues."

I can't understand why this is; the values in my map are Staff objects and it.HasNext() should be returning them to be stored in the staffMember variable, which should be fine to my knowledge?? Help much appreciated. Collection <Staff> staffList = staff.values();          Iterator it = staffList.iterator ();         while ((isJobAssigned = false) ||it.hasNext())         {             Staff staffMember = it.next();              if ((staffMember instanceof Typist) && (jobType.equalsIgnoreCase(\"Typist\")))             {                 newJob.setJobState (\"Assigned\");                 staffMember.setState(\"Working\");                 return newJon.getJobNo() + \" Staff allocated: \" + staffMember.getName () + \", ID: \" + staffMember.getId();                }\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
