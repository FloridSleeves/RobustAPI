If they are not equal, we print \"Bytes are not equal\" and break out of the loop.\n- If both bytes are -1, it means we have reached the end of both files and all bytes are equal. We print \"Files are equal\".\n- If either byte is not -1, it means the files have different lengths or at least one byte is different. We print \"Files are not equal\".\n- Finally, we close the FileInputStream objects to release the resources."

Improve this question                    can anyone write pseudocode to compare byte to byte in Java. I understand that we use read() to read byte to byte. but how do we do the comparison? \nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
