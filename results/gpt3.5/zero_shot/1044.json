We then iterate over each token using a `while` loop and check if the token is a number using the `isNumber` method. If it is a number, we convert it to an integer using the `convertToNumber` method and add it to the `sum` variable. Finally, we print the sum.\n\nThe `isNumber` method uses a try-catch block to check if the token can be parsed as an integer. If it can, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.\n\nThe `convertToNumber` method simply parses the token as an integer and returns the result.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the numbers in the sentence are written as integers (e.g., \"thirteen\" is converted to 13). If you need to handle numbers written as words (e.g., \"thirteen\" is converted to 3), you will need to implement a more complex logic to handle the conversion."

Though the numbers are written in a text format. I want to accomplish this myself though i have stumbled upon a few difficulties that i would like some advice on.An example of the question is that one child has thirteen balloons and is selling them for three hundred cents. Obviously I have to set up the variables so the string numbers are converted into an integers e.g.int one = 1, two = 2, three = 3, twelve = 12, thirty = 30, hundred = 100;My initial attempt is to create a loop where I have assigned a count to stop when all the numbers have been accumulated, though the loop keeps on adding the the first number.My question is, when I input the text using the scanner object, what loop is required to add the first (written) number and then move onto the second (written) number, which will be added to the sum variable?Thanks for your time and I hope that this question is easy to understand.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
