This means that you are always starting from the beginning of the iterator instead of moving to the next element.\n<<<explanation>>>: When you call `testCStickChart.iterator().next().getEPIC()`, you are creating a new iterator object each time, which starts from the beginning of the iterator. That's why it always returns the first EPIC.\nTo fix this issue, you should create the iterator object outside of the for loop and use the same iterator object to iterate through the elements. Here's an updated version of your code:\n\nIterator<CStick> iterator = testCStickChart.iterator();\nfor (CStick localCStick : testCStickChart) {\n  System.out.println(localCStick.getEPIC());\n  System.out.println(\"next EPIC is \" + iterator.next().getEPIC());\n}\n\nBy creating the iterator object outside of the for loop, you ensure that you are iterating through the elements in the correct order."

I expected it to give me the next CStick in my CStickChart (hence when I call the getEPIC I was expecting it to give me the next EPIC along).// Print the EPIC out of the Array using the iteratorfor (CStick localCStick : testCStickChart) {  System.out.println(localCStick.getEPIC());  //The below line doesn't return the next CStick and I'm not sure why  System.out.println(\"next EPIC is \" + testCStickChart.iterator().next().getEPIC());}Please could someone explain why this is not the case (it always returns the first EPIC)\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
