This approach is inefficient for large files because it requires reading file 2 for each line in file 1, resulting in a high number of I/O operations.\n\nTo improve the efficiency, you can use a different approach:\n\n1. Read all the lines from file 2 and store them in a HashSet or a HashMap for faster lookup.\n2. Iterate through each line in file 1 and check if it exists in the HashSet or HashMap.\n\nHere's an updated code snippet that implements this approach:\n\npublic void getMBD() throws Exception {\n    BufferedReader br1 = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"C://AllIDs.txt\"));\n    BufferedReader br2 = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"C://DIDs.txt\"));\n    PrintWriter pr = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(\"C://MBD.txt\"));\n    \n    Set<Long> ids = new HashSet<>();\n    String line;\n    \n    // Read all lines from file 2 and store them in the HashSet\n    while ((line = br2.readLine()) != null) {\n        ids.add(Long.parseLong(line));\n    }\n    \n    int count = 1;\n    \n    // Iterate through each line in file 1 and check if it exists in the HashSet\n    while ((line = br1.readLine()) != null) {\n        long bioid = Long.parseLong(line);\n        System.out.println(count);\n        if (!ids.contains(bioid)) {\n            pr.write(bioid + \"\\n\");\n        }\n        count++;\n    }\n    \n    br1.close();\n    br2.close();\n    pr.close();\n}\n\nThis approach significantly reduces the number of I/O operations by reading file 2 only once and using a HashSet for efficient lookup. It should greatly improve the processing time for large files."

That is about three months!Is there any ideas to make it done in a much much more less time.Thanks in advance.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
