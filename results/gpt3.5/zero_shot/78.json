First, create a DataOutputStream object using the OutputStream from the socket. Then, use the write method to write the XML data as bytes to the output stream. Finally, call the flush method to ensure that all the data is sent. This way, you can send the XML data without closing the socket."

It wait for EOF but I can't send it because if I use out.close();orskt.shutdownOutput();I close the Socket and I must keep this connection alive.I can't send '\\0' becouse I get Parse Error in the server.How can I do it? Can I \"close\" the output stream without closing the socket?RESOLVEDI've created new class XMLStreamOutput and XMLStreamInput with advanced Stream gesture.\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:"
