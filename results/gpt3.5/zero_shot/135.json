In your code, you were using \"\\nameFolder\" instead of \"\\\\\" + nameFolder. The \"\\\\\" is used to escape the backslash character in the file path. By using \"\\\\\" + nameFolder, you are correctly concatenating the path and folder name to create the directory. Additionally, you should use the mkdirs() method instead of mkdir() to create the directory and any necessary parent directories. The mkdirs() method will create all directories in the specified path if they do not exist."

So the error has to be in here. But I cant figure out what I did wrong since I am a first-timer with this.   public void makeDirectory(String path, String nameFolder) {    File dir = new File(path + \"\\nameFolder\");    dir.mkdir();}Thank you for your timeEDIT: 'Doesn't work' means no directory is being created.EDIT2:Have been able to make it work thx to Niks Tyagi    public void makeDirectory(String path, String nameFolder) {    File dir = new File(path +\"\\\\\"+ nameFolder);    dir.mkdirs();}\nPlease using this api: File.mkdirs.\nAnswer:"
