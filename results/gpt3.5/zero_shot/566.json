They are designed to read/write a single image from/to an input/output stream. In your case, you are continuously sending images over the socket, but ImageIO.read() is not able to detect the end of an image and it returns null for the second image.\n\nTo solve this issue, you can use the Iterator.next() method from the ImageIO API. This method allows you to iterate over the available ImageReaders or ImageWriters for a specific image format. By using this method, you can create a new ImageReader or ImageWriter for each image and properly handle the streaming of multiple images.\n\nIn the server code, you can use the Iterator.next() method to get the next available ImageWriter for the \"jpg\" format. Then, you can set the output of the writer to the OutputStream of the socket and write the image using writer.write().\n\nIn the client code, you can use the Iterator.next() method to get the next available ImageReader for the \"jpg\" format. Then, you can set the input of the reader to the InputStream of the socket and read the image using reader.read(0).\n\nBy using this approach, you will be able to properly stream multiple images using ImageIO."

So I wondered if ImageIO could detect the end of an image. (I have absolutely no knowledge of the JPEG format, so I tested it instead)Apparently, not.On the server side, I sent images continuously by using ImageIO.write(...) in loop with some sleeping in between. On the client side, ImageIO read the first image no problem, but on the next one it returned null. This is confusing. I was expecting it to either block on reading the first image (because it thinks the next image is still part of the same image), or succeed at reading all of them (because it works). What is going on? It looks like ImageIO detects the end of the first image, but not the second one. (The images, by the way, are similar to each other roughly) Is there an easy way to stream images like this or do I have to make my own mechanism that reads the bytes into a buffer until it reaches a specified byte or sequence of bytes, at which point it reads the image out of the buffer?This is the useful part of my server code:        while(true){            Socket sock=s.accept();            System.out.println(\"Connection\");            OutputStream out=sock.getOutputStream();            while(!socket.isClosed()){                BufferedImage img=//get image                ImageIO.write(img, \"jpg\", out);                Thread.sleep(100);            }            System.out.println(\"Closed\");        }And my client code:        Socket s=new Socket(InetAddress.getByName(\"localhost\"), 1998);        InputStream in=s.getInputStream();        while(!s.isClosed()){            BufferedImage img=ImageIO.read(in);            if(img==null)//this is what happens on the SECOND image            else // do something useful with the image        }\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
