We create a two-dimensional array with the desired size.\n2. We create an iterator for the array using the custom `RandomIterator` class.\n3. We initialize two counters, `choice1Count` and `choice2Count`, to keep track of the number of occurrences of each choice.\n4. We iterate through the array using the iterator.\n5. At each index, we generate a random number between 0 and 1 using `Math.random()`.\n6. If the random number is less than 0.5, we choose the first choice (represented by 1) and increment `choice1Count`.\n7. Otherwise, we choose the second choice (represented by 2) and increment `choice2Count`.\n8. We repeat steps 5-7 until the array is filled.\n9. Finally, we print the array and the counts of each choice to verify that we have an even split."

Let's also assume for clarity that you can only choose between two things to put as a given item in the array. How would you go about putting a random choice at a given index in the array but once the array is filled you have an even split among the two choices?If there are any answers with code, Java is preferred but other languages are fine as well.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
