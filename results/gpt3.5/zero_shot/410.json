                "content": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next()\n<<<code>>>: There is no direct equivalent of Collections.rotate() for a Map. However, you can achieve a similar effect by using an Iterator to iterate over the Map entries and reassigning the values in a new Map.\n\nHere's an example of how you can achieve this:\n\n```java\nMap<String, Integer> teamWins = new HashMap<>();\n// Populate the teamWins map with team names and initial win counts\n\nList<Map.Entry<String, Integer>> entries = new ArrayList<>(teamWins.entrySet());\nCollections.rotate(entries, 1); // Rotate the entries by 1 position\n\nMap<String, Integer> rotatedTeamWins = new LinkedHashMap<>();\nfor (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : entries) {\n    rotatedTeamWins.put(entry.getKey(), entry.getValue());\n}\n\n// The rotatedTeamWins map now contains the same entries as teamWins, but with a different order\n```\n\n<<<explanation>>>: In this code, we first convert the Map entries to a List using `teamWins.entrySet()`. Then, we use `Collections.rotate()` to rotate the List by 1 position. Finally, we iterate over the rotated List and put the entries back into a new Map (`rotatedTeamWins`) using a `LinkedHashMap` to preserve the order.\n\nNote that this approach only rotates the order of the entries in the Map, not the keys or values themselves. If you need to rotate the keys or values as well, you would need to modify the code accordingly."

I have this working, and now I'm looking at expanding it to hold results. At the moment I read all the teams into a list. and use Collections.rotate to rotate the list in order to randomize the fixtures.I was thinking of using a Map to hold the team and number of wins, however rotate doesn't appear to work for map. Is there a similar function that I'm missing, or something that I have overlooked?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
