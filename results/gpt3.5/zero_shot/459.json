The RETURN statement then returns the properties of each node using the properties() function. The result is an iterator that can be used to iterate over the nodes and access their properties. To retrieve all properties for a node in a Java application, you can use the Iterator.next() method to iterate over the nodes and retrieve their properties."

I need to get it for a Java application.Example:node FR contains: \"Salut_01\" : \"Bonjour\"node UK contains: \"Salut_01\" : \"Hello\"etc...\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
