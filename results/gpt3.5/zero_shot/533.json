Here's an example:\n\n```java\nIterator<T> iterator = collection.iterator();\nsynchronized (iterator) {\n    while (iterator.hasNext()) {\n        T element = iterator.next();\n        // Do something with the element\n    }\n}\n```\n\n<<<explanation>>>: In this code, we create an iterator from the collection and synchronize access to it using the `synchronized` keyword. This ensures that only one thread can access the iterator at a time, preventing simultaneous access by other threads. Inside the synchronized block, we can safely call `iterator.next()` to retrieve the next element from the collection."

Although the API's have the methods that return synchronised versions of common collections, there seems to be no way to programmatically release the lock by calling a finished method; AFAICT the lock appears to be released when the wrapper is garbage collected.Is there anything that does this in the Java SE API, or is it considered easy enough just to roll something myself? Thanks for your constructive input.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
