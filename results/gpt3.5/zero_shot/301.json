The Iterator.next() method returns the next element in the iterator. By checking if the iterator has a next element using Iterator.hasNext(), you can determine if you have reached the end of the array. If the iterator does not have a next element, you can reset it to the beginning of the array by creating a new iterator using Arrays.asList(flames).iterator()."

What I wanted is for it to go back to the first index until z is equal to ctr. How can I do that?My code:char res;int ctr = 10char[] flames = {'F','L','A','M','E','S'};for(int z = 0; z < ctr-1; z++){    res = (flames[z]);    jLabel1.setText(String.valueOf(res));}\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
