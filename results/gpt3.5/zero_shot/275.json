The Iterator provides a safe way to remove elements during iteration. In the given code, we create an Iterator for the newTopEnemy ArrayList using the iterator() method. Then, we use a while loop to iterate over the elements. Inside the loop, we retrieve the current element using the next() method of the Iterator. We perform the distance calculation and check if the distance is less than 10.0. If it is, we remove the element using the remove() method of the Iterator. This ensures that the element is safely removed from the ArrayList without causing any ConcurrentModificationException."

I am trying to make it so that if the enemies are within a certain distance of the ammos, then the enemys remove themselves from the screen. I have attempted to do it and the code compiles, but i am unsure why the enemys arent being removed from the screen once been hit. Can anyone see anything wrong with the code below? Thankyoufor (TopEnemy i : newTopEnemy){    for (int q = 0; q < ammo.length; q++)    {       float xsubs = i.enemyX - ammo[q].positionX;       float ysubs = i.enemyY - ammo[q].positionY;       float squared = (xsubs * xsubs) + (ysubs * ysubs);       float distance = (float)Math.sqrt(squared);       if (distance < 10.0)       {          newTopEnemy.remove(q);       }    } }  \nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
