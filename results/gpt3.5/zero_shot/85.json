                "content": "<<<api>>>: DataOutputStream.write()\n<<<code>>>: The issue is with the client side code where the message is being sent using the DataOutputStream.write() method.\n<<<explanation>>>: The DataOutputStream.write() method writes the entire byte array to the output stream. In your code, you are sending the entire message1 array, which is 25 kilobytes in size, even though only the first 5 bytes contain the count. This causes the server to read more data than expected and leads to the error.\n\nTo fix this issue, you need to modify the client side code to send only the first 5 bytes of the message1 array, which contain the count. You can use the DataOutputStream.write(byte[] b, int off, int len) method to achieve this. Here's the modified code:\n\n```\nout.write(message1, 0, 5);\n```\n\nThis will write only the first 5 bytes of the message1 array to the output stream.\n\nAdditionally, you should also consider flushing the output stream after writing the data using the DataOutputStream.flush() method. This ensures that all the data is sent immediately instead of being buffered.\n\n```\nout.write(message1, 0, 5);\nout.flush();\n```\n\nBy making these changes, the server will receive only the count string and the error should be resolved."

The messages I'm sending are 25 kilos with the first 5 bytes containing the count from the client in the form of a string padded with asterisks to maintain a 5 byte length. However after 3 or 4 successful messages the server fails to find the count. Is there something that I am forgetting to consider? My guess is that the server is having trouble keeping up with the client as the number of successful messages varies from 3 - 4 before error.CLIENT SIDE CODE:try{        clientSocket = new Socket(\"192.168.0.15\", SERVER_PORT);           DataInputStream in = new DataInputStream(clientSocket.getInputStream());        DataOutputStream out = new DataOutputStream(clientSocket.getOutputStream());        int messageCounter = 0;        byte [] message1 = new byte[25 * 1024];        byte [] returnMessage1 = new byte[25 * 1024];        byte [] count;        long startTime1 = System.nanoTime();        while (messageCounter < 100000) {            System.out.println(messageCounter);            addCountToMessage(formatCount(messageCounter).getBytes(), message1);            out.write(message1);            in.read(returnMessage1);                 messageCounter ++;            }      }SERVER SIDE CODE: try {      byte [] data = new byte[35 * 1024];      System.out.println(\"STARTING LOOP\");      System.out.println(\"***********************************\");      int messageCounter = 0;      int clientMessageCount = 0;      String clientCountString = \"\";      byte[] clientCount = new byte[5];      while (true){          in.read(data);          clientCount[0] = data[0];          clientCount[1] = data[1];          clientCount[2] = data[2];          clientCount[3] = data[3];          clientCount[4] = data[4];          clientCountString = new String(clientCount);          System.out.println(\"Received Count String: \\\"\" + clientCountString + \"\\\"\");          clientCountString = clientCountString.replace(\"*\", \"\");          clientMessageCount = Integer.parseInt(clientCountString);          System.out.println(\"Client Count: \" + clientMessageCount + \", Server Count: \" + messageCounter);          out.write(data);          System.out.println(\"***********************************\");          messageCounter ++;      }   }OUTPUT OF SERVER:java TCPServerSTARTING LOOPReceived Count String: \"0****\"Client Count: 0, Server Count: 0Received Count String: \"1****\"Client Count: 1, Server Count: 1Received Count String: \"2****\"Client Count: 2, Server Count: 2Received Count String: \"3****\"Client Count: 3, Server Count: 3Received Count String: \"\"Exception in thread \"Thread-0\" java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: \"\"at java.lang.NumberFormatException.forInputString(NumberFormatException.java:65)at java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Integer.java:481)at java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Integer.java:527)at Connection.run(TCPServer.java:52)\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:"
