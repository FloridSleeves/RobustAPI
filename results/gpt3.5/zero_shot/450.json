Instead, you should return the instance of the LinkedList class itself, since it implements the Iterator interface. By returning \"this\", you are returning the current instance of the LinkedList class, which also acts as an iterator.\n\nBy doing this, you don't need to define a separate inner class for the iterator. The methods hasNext(), next(), and remove() can be directly implemented in the LinkedList class itself. This approach simplifies the code and avoids the need for an additional class."

Here is the header for the shell of the class:public class LinkedList<T> implements Iterable<T>, Iterator<T>Note he is implementing the Iterable and Iterator interfaces. I then understand that I need to implement an iterator(), hasNext(), next(), and remove() methods in my class. What confuses me though is that he does not put the methods required for the Iterator interface in a separate inner class. All of the methods below are defined in the LinkedList class:/* * (non-Javadoc) *  * @see java.lang.Iterable#iterator() */@Overridepublic Iterator<T> iterator(){    return null;}/* * (non-Javadoc) *  * @see java.util.Iterator#hasNext() */@Overridepublic boolean hasNext(){    return false;}/* * (non-Javadoc) *  * @see java.util.Iterator#next() */@Overridepublic T next(){    return null;}/* * (non-Javadoc) *  * @see java.util.Iterator#remove() */@Overridepublic void remove(){}Shouldn't the iterator() method be returning something like:public Iterator<T> iterator(){    return new MyClassIterator(front);}Where MyClassIterator() is defined with the hasNext(), next(), and remove() methods. What am I missing?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
