However, the PrintWriter class is typically used for writing to an existing file, not for creating a new file. To create a file in Java, you can use the File class and its createNewFile() method. This method creates a new, empty file at the specified path. Make sure to handle the IOException that may be thrown by the createNewFile() method."

I am trying to create a function that creates a file with the path/file name of the string path. Here's my code:public static void CreateFile(String path) throws FileNotFoundException, UnsupportedEncodingException {    PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(path, \"UTF-8\");    writer.close();}What did I do wrong? Shouldn't it create a file? \nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
