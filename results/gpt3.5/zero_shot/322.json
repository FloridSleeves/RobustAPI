This class will have a backing iterator of type Iterator<Item> and will delegate the hasNext() and next() methods to the backing iterator.\n\nIn the next() method, you can create a new FacadeItem object by passing the next item from the backing iterator to the FacadeItem constructor. This way, each time the next() method is called on the FacadeItemIterator, it will return a FacadeItem object instead of an Item object.\n\nNote that you don't need to use the ForwardingIterator from the Guava library for this task. You can simply implement the Iterator<FacadeItem> interface directly."
