This causes the `NoSuchElementException` because you are trying to get the next token even when there might not be any more tokens available.\n\nTo fix this issue, you can modify your code as follows:\n\n```java\npublic void map(Object key, Text value, Context context) throws IOException, InterruptedException {\n    StringTokenizer itr = new StringTokenizer(value.toString());\n    itr.nextToken(); // Skip over first line, which has just one element\n    while (itr.hasMoreTokens()) {\n        itr.nextToken(); // Skip over word\n        if (itr.hasMoreTokens()) { // Check if there is another token available\n            count.set(itr.nextToken()); // save count as key\n            context.write(count, one);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBy adding the `if (itr.hasMoreTokens())` condition, you ensure that there is another token available before trying to get it using `itr.nextToken()`. This will prevent the `NoSuchElementException` from occurring.\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The issue in your code is that you are calling `itr.nextToken()` twice in each iteration of the while loop.
