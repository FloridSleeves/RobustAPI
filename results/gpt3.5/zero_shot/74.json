Then, we switch to using the ObjectOutputStream and write an object using the writeObject method. Finally, we switch back to using the DataOutputStream and write an integer using the writeInt method.\n\nNote that when switching between different types of streams, you need to make sure to flush the stream to ensure that all data is sent before switching. Also, remember to close the streams and socket when you are done with them."

Is this possible and what is the best way to do it?I've tried just creating both types of objects, for example ObjectOutputStream and DataOutputStream, but that doesn't seem to work.The reason I want to switch between them is to, for example, send a text command \"INFO\" that signals I'm about to send an object with information or a command \"DATA\" signalling that I'm about to send data.  Any advice on the best way to do this is appreciated.\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:"
