Shuffle the ArrayList using a specific algorithm (e.g., Fisher-Yates shuffle).\n4. Create an Iterator from the shuffled ArrayList.\n5. Iterate over the Iterator and retrieve the values from the HashMap using the keys.\n\nHere's an example code snippet:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class ShuffleKeyValuePairs {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        HashMap<Integer, String> keyValuePairs = new HashMap<>();\n        keyValuePairs.put(100, \"white\");\n        keyValuePairs.put(200, \"black\");\n        keyValuePairs.put(300, \"red\");\n\n        ArrayList<Integer> keys = new ArrayList<>(keyValuePairs.keySet());\n        Collections.shuffle(keys);\n\n        Iterator<Integer> iterator = keys.iterator();\n        while (iterator.hasNext()) {\n            Integer key = iterator.next();\n            String value = keyValuePairs.get(key);\n            System.out.println(key + \" \" + value);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n<<<explanation>>>:\n1. We create a HashMap to store the key-value pairs.\n2. We create an ArrayList to store the keys from the HashMap.\n3. We shuffle the ArrayList using the `Collections.shuffle()` method, which shuffles the elements using the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm.\n4. We create an Iterator from the shuffled ArrayList.\n5. We iterate over the Iterator using the `hasNext()` and `next()` methods, and retrieve the corresponding values from the HashMap using the keys.\n\nThis approach allows you to shuffle the key-value pairs dynamically while still being able to revert the data when needed."

Data is actually based on key-value structure.Like;100 \"white\"200 \"black\"300 \"red\"and like that. What I want to do is to change the key-value pairs according to I don't know yet, some algorithm.But they need to be shuffled like this, but shuffling need to be not random, so I can revert data when I need.100 \"red\"200 \"white\"300 \"black\"I don't really know how my approach should be to the solution. Should I use HashTable or something, and how can I shuffle them dynamically?Any help is appreciated\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
