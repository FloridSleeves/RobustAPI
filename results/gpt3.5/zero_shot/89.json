Here is an example code snippet to demonstrate how to implement this feature:\n\nIn App \"A\":\n1. Create a Socket object and connect it to the IP address and port of the device running App \"B\":\n   Socket socket = new Socket(\"B_DEVICE_IP_ADDRESS\", B_DEVICE_PORT);\n\n2. Create a DataOutputStream object using the OutputStream of the socket:\n   DataOutputStream dataOutputStream = new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());\n\n3. Use the write method of the DataOutputStream to send the data:\n   String dataToSend = \"Hello from App A\";\n   dataOutputStream.write(dataToSend.getBytes());\n\n4. Close the socket and the DataOutputStream when done:\n   dataOutputStream.close();\n   socket.close();\n\nIn App \"B\":\n1. Create a ServerSocket object and bind it to a specific port:\n   ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(B_DEVICE_PORT);\n\n2. Accept incoming connections from App \"A\":\n   Socket socket = serverSocket.accept();\n\n3. Create a DataInputStream object using the InputStream of the socket:\n   DataInputStream dataInputStream = new DataInputStream(socket.getInputStream());\n\n4. Read the data sent from App \"A\":\n   byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\n   int bytesRead = dataInputStream.read(buffer);\n   String receivedData = new String(buffer, 0, bytesRead);\n\n5. Close the socket and the DataInputStream when done:\n   dataInputStream.close();\n   socket.close();\n   serverSocket.close();\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nIn App \"A\", we create a Socket object and connect it to the IP address and port of the device running App \"B\". Then, we create a DataOutputStream object using the OutputStream of the socket and use the write method to send the data.\n\nIn App \"B\", we create a ServerSocket object and bind it to a specific port. We accept incoming connections from App \"A\" using the accept method of the ServerSocket. Then, we create a DataInputStream object using the InputStream of the socket and read the data sent from App \"A\" using the read method.\n\nNote: Make sure to replace \"B_DEVICE_IP_ADDRESS\" with the actual IP address of the device running App \"B\" and \"B_DEVICE_PORT\" with the desired port number. Also, don't forget to handle exceptions appropriately in your code."
