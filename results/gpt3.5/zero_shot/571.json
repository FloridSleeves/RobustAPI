The `pickWidget()` method checks if the iterator has a next element using `iterator.hasNext()`. If it does not have a next element, it means we have reached the end of the list and need to start from the beginning again. In this case, we create a new iterator using `Iterables.cycle(widgets)` and assign it to the `iterator` variable. Finally, we return the next element using `iterator.next()`. This way, the `pickWidget()` method will cycle through the list of widgets indefinitely."

Apache's CircularFifoQueue seems close but no cigar, as I don't want anything popped off the queue, I just want it to cycle over the same list time and time again as it is called.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
