Here's an example of how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\npublic void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain) throws IOException, ServletException {\n    CharArrayWrapper responseWrapper = new CharArrayWrapper((HttpServletResponse) response);\n    \n    try {\n        chain.doFilter(request, responseWrapper);\n    } catch (Exception e) {\n        // Handle the exception here\n        responseWrapper.reset(); // Clear the response buffer\n        \n        PrintWriter out = responseWrapper.getWriter();\n        out.write(\"An error occurred: \" + e.getMessage());\n    }\n    \n    String responseString = responseWrapper.toString();\n    System.out.println(\"responseString ********************* \" + responseString);\n    \n    PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();\n    out.write(responseString);\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: In the modified code, we added a try-catch block around the chain.doFilter method to catch any unhandled exceptions raised in the JSP. If an exception occurs, we reset the response buffer using responseWrapper.reset() to clear any previously written content. Then, we get the PrintWriter from the responseWrapper and use the write method to write a custom error message to the response. Finally, we continue with the rest of the code to retrieve the response content and write it to the actual response."

In the filter I am using HTTPResponseWrapper for modifying the response to the user. My code in doFilter method of Filter is:CharArrayWrapper responseWrapper = new CharArrayWrapper(        (HttpServletResponse) response); chain.doFilter(request, responseWrapper);String responseString = responseWrapper.toString();System.out.println(\"responseString ********************* \"        + responseString);PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();out.write(responseString);The CharArrayWrapper class is:public class CharArrayWrapper extends HttpServletResponseWrapper {    private CharArrayWriter charWriter;    public CharArrayWrapper(HttpServletResponse response) {        super(response);        charWriter = new CharArrayWriter();    }    public PrintWriter getWriter() {        return (new PrintWriter(charWriter));    }    public String toString() {        return (charWriter.toString());    }    public char[] toCharArray() {        return (charWriter.toCharArray());    }}If the JSP for which the above filter is configured executes fine, there is no problem in the filter too and I can see the sysout on the console. On the other hand, when there is some unhandled exception raised in the JSP scriptlet code (its an old application) and I invoke chain.doFilter(request, responseWrapper);,  I get a NullPointerException. Is there any way by which I can know in my filter that there was an unhandled exception raised in the JSP\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
