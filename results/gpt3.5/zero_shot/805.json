First, we create an array of strings that we want to save in the file.\n2. We create a `File` object with the file name \"db.txt\".\n3. We check if the file exists. If not, we create a new file using `file.createNewFile()`.\n4. We use a `PrintWriter` wrapped in a `FileWriter` to write the strings to the file. We iterate over the array of strings and use `writer.write()` to write each string to the file. We also add a newline character (\"\\n\") after each string to separate them.\n5. We use a `Scanner` to read the strings from the file. We iterate over the file using `scanner.hasNextLine()` to check if there is another line to read. If so, we read the line using `scanner.nextLine()` and insert it into the array at the corresponding index.\n6. Finally, we print the updated array to verify that the strings were successfully read from the file and inserted into the array."

How do I create a new text file (if not existing already), how do I write to it and how do I read from it? Tried to learn it by myself but I've seen so many ways on the Internet and got confused.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
