If you don't call this method, the command line is not executed. However, if you do call the close() method, you can't execute any other command lines.\n\nTo solve this issue, you can try using the ProcessBuilder's inheritIO() method. This method redirects the standard output and error of the subprocess to the standard output and error of the current process. By using inheritIO(), you can see the output of the subprocess without having to read it from the InputStream.\n\nHere's an updated version of your code using inheritIO():\n\nProcessBuilder builder = new ProcessBuilder(PROCESS);\nbuilder.inheritIO();\nProcess p = builder.start();\n\nString command = com.nextLine();\nOutputStream o = p.getOutputStream();\no.write(comando.getBytes());\no.flush();\no.close();\n\nWith this code, you should be able to see the output of the subprocess without having to read it from the InputStream. You can also execute multiple command lines without any issues."

If I dont call this method the command line isn't executed.I want to execute more than one command but I can't.Example:\"Call phone\" and then \"terminate\" to end the call whenever I want. But I can only insert the first command line and if I dont use the close() method the command line is not executed.Code:Start a process:ProcessBuilder builder = new ProcessBuilder(PROCESS);builder.redirectErrorStream(true);Process p = builder.start();Read the InputStream of Process:InputStream i = p.getInputStream();System.out.print((char)i.read());while(i.available() > 0){    System.out.print((char)i.read());}Insert command line into OutputStream:String command = com.nextLine();OutputStream o = p.getOutputStream();o.write(comando.getBytes());o.flush();o.close();If I delete \"o.close()\" the command line is not executed, but if I execute it I can't execute the other command lines.I tried the code on my program, but when I insert the command line I dont see the next information of the process.When I put your code :ReadyWarning: video is disabled in linphonec, use -V or -C or -D to enable.linphonec> Registration on sip:XX.XX.XX.XX successful.linphonec> call XXXExemple with my code:ReadyWarning: video is disabled in linphonec, use -V or -C or -D to enable.linphonec> Registration on sip:XX.XX.XX.XX successful.linphonec> call XXXEstablishing call id to sip:XXX@XX.XX.XX.XX, assigned id 1With \"Available > 0\" I get \"Establishing call id to sip:XXX@XX.XX.XX.XX, assigned id 1\".If I use this loop I dont see the other info of the process.I think the problem is that the outputstream does not get the command lines until I execute the Close method.Thank you.Sorry for my bad englando.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
