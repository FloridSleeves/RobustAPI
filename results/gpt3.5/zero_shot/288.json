Here's an example:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.function.Function;\n\nclass FunctionWrapper<T, R> {\n    private Function<T, R> function;\n\n    public FunctionWrapper(Function<T, R> function) {\n        this.function = function;\n    }\n\n    public <V> FunctionWrapper<T, V> compose(Function<R, V> other) {\n        return new FunctionWrapper<>(function.andThen(other));\n    }\n\n    public R apply(T input) {\n        return function.apply(input);\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Function<Integer, Integer> increment = x -> x + 1;\n        Function<Integer, Integer> doubleValue = x -> x * 2;\n\n        FunctionWrapper<Integer, Integer> functionWrapper = new FunctionWrapper<>(increment);\n        functionWrapper = functionWrapper.compose(doubleValue);\n\n        System.out.println(functionWrapper.apply(3)); // Output: 8\n    }\n}\n```\n\n<<<explanation>>>: In this code, the `FunctionWrapper` class wraps a `Function` and provides a `compose` method to compose it with another function. The `compose` method uses the `andThen` method of the `Function` interface to create a new composed function. The `apply` method applies the wrapped function to an input value.\n\nIn the `Main` class, we create two functions `increment` and `doubleValue`. We then create a `FunctionWrapper` instance with the `increment` function and compose it with the `doubleValue` function using the `compose` method. Finally, we apply the composed function to an input value of 3 and print the result.\n\nThis approach allows you to compose functions and assign the composed function to the `FunctionWrapper` instance. You can continue composing functions by calling the `compose` method multiple times."
