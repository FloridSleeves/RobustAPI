Here's an example:\n\n```java\nString attributeValue = \"B&#252;ro.txt\";\nbyte[] attributeBytes = attributeValue.getBytes(\"UTF-8\");\n\n// Write the attribute bytes to the output stream\noutputStream.write(attributeBytes);\n```\n\nMake sure to replace \"outputStream\" with the actual output stream you are using to serialize the XML.\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nThe String.getBytes() method converts a string to a byte array using the specified character encoding. By converting the attribute value to bytes and writing them directly to the output stream, you bypass the XmlSerializer's automatic escaping of special characters like \"&\". This allows you to preserve the original attribute value without any unwanted transformations."

Should I be doing this differently any way?UpdateI should also say that I am using jre 1.6. I had been using jre 1.5 until recently and I am pretty sure that it was serialized 'correctly' (i.e. the '&' was not escaped)ClarificationThe DOM is created programmatically. Here is an example:        Document doc = createDocument();        Element root = doc.createElement(\"root\");        doc.appendChild(root);        root.setAttribute(\"test1\", \"&#234;\");        root.setAttribute(\"test2\", \"\u00fc\u00f6\u00e4\");        root.appendChild(doc.createTextNode(\"&#234;\"));        StringWriter sw = new StringWriter();        serializeDocument(doc, sw);        System.out.println(sw.toString());My solutionI didn't really want to do this because it involved a fair amount of code change and testing but I decided to move the attribute data into a CDATA element. Problem solved avoided.\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:"
