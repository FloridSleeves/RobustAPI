Partial mocking can make the test code more complex and harder to understand. It can also lead to fragile tests that break easily when the implementation of the class being mocked changes.\n\nIf you find yourself needing to mock only a few methods of an object, it is usually a sign that the object has multiple responsibilities and violates the Single Responsibility Principle. In such cases, it is better to refactor the class and extract the separate concerns into separate classes. This will make the code more modular and easier to test.\n\nIf you cannot mock the object because you only want to mock a few methods, you can consider using a different mocking framework that supports partial mocking more easily, such as Mockito. However, it is still recommended to refactor the class to separate concerns if possible.\n\nIn general, it is best to avoid partial mocking and instead focus on writing tests that verify the behavior of the class as a whole. If the class is too complex to test, it may be a sign that it needs to be refactored into smaller, more focused classes."

However, often i find writing partial mocks time consuming, and it does not feel 'right'.I'd say its a design fault as my class I try to mock has multiple concerns into one, therefore I should create seperate classes in order to seperate concerns.What do you think? Is partially mocking a good or bad thing? And, if good/bad, why? What would you suggest if you notice you cannot mock the object because you only want to mock a few methods?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
