The OutputStreamWriter allows you to specify the encoding when creating the PrintWriter object. In this case, you can pass \"UTF-8\" as the encoding parameter to the OutputStreamWriter constructor. Then, you can use the write method of the PrintWriter object to write the content to the file. Finally, remember to close the PrintWriter object to ensure that all the data is flushed and the file is properly closed."
