It uses a buffer of size 8 bytes to read and write the data. This code will replicate the binary output file generated in C. However, it does not automatically apply C padding in Java output. The padding in C is compiler-dependent and may vary across different compilers. To replicate the exact padding, you would need to refer to the compiler documentation or analyze the binary file generated by the C compiler to understand the padding rules used by the specific compiler (in this case, g++)."

As the example in the link says, when writing a struct like this:struct { char c; int i;} a;to a binary file, the compiler will usually leave an unnamed, unused hole between the char and int fields, to ensure that the int field is properly aligned. How could I to create an exact replica of the binary output file (generated in C), using a different language (in my case, Java)?Is there an automatic way to apply C padding in Java output? Or do I have to go through compiler documentation to see how it works (the compiler is g++ by the way).\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
