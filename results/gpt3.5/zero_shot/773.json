I have used the PrintWriter.write API to write the user information to the file. First, I prompt the user to enter their username and password. Then, I create a new File object with the name \"user.txt\". Next, I create a FileWriter object and pass the File object to it. This FileWriter object is used to write characters to the file. Then, I create a PrintWriter object and pass the FileWriter object to it. The PrintWriter object provides convenient methods for writing formatted text to the file. I use the println method of PrintWriter to write the username and password to the file. Finally, I close the PrintWriter object to ensure that all the data is written to the file. If any exception occurs during the file creation process, an error message is displayed."

I know it has to be with createNewFile method but I do not know how to use it. I'd try this in my code:import java.util.*;public class File{public static void main(String args[]){    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);byte option=0;    do{        System.out.println(\"\\nMENU:\\n\");        System.out.println(\"0.-EXIT\");        System.out.println(\"1.-REGISTER USER\");        System.out.println(\"\\nPLEASE ENTER YOUR CHOICE:\");        option = sc.nextByte();    }while(option!=0);}//main}//File\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
