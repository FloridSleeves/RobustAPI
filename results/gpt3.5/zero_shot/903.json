The code is using the OutputStream's write() method to write the message string as bytes to the response. The thread safety of the TestServlet class depends on how it is deployed and used. If multiple threads are accessing the same instance of the TestServlet class concurrently, there is a possibility of race conditions and thread safety issues. In this case, the message variable is not thread-safe because it is a shared instance variable that can be modified by multiple threads simultaneously. To make it thread-safe, you can use synchronization mechanisms like synchronized blocks or methods to ensure that only one thread can access and modify the message variable at a time."
