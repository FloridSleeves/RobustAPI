Create an instance of the SOAPMessage class using the SOAPMessageFactory.\n2. Get the SOAPPart from the SOAPMessage.\n3. Get the SOAPEnvelope from the SOAPPart.\n4. Get the SOAPBody from the SOAPEnvelope.\n5. Get the SOAPElement from the SOAPBody.\n6. Get the InputStream from the SOAPElement.\n7. Read the data from the InputStream using the InputStream.read method.\n\nHere is an example code snippet:\n\n```\n// Create an instance of the SOAPMessageFactory\nSOAPMessageFactory factory = SOAPMessageFactory.newInstance();\n\n// Create a SOAPMessage from the InputStream\nSOAPMessage soapMessage = factory.createMessage(null, inputStream);\n\n// Get the SOAPPart from the SOAPMessage\nSOAPPart soapPart = soapMessage.getSOAPPart();\n\n// Get the SOAPEnvelope from the SOAPPart\nSOAPEnvelope soapEnvelope = soapPart.getEnvelope();\n\n// Get the SOAPBody from the SOAPEnvelope\nSOAPBody soapBody = soapEnvelope.getBody();\n\n// Get the SOAPElement from the SOAPBody\nSOAPElement soapElement = (SOAPElement) soapBody.getChildElements().next();\n\n// Get the InputStream from the SOAPElement\nInputStream mtomStream = soapElement.getValueAsStream();\n\n// Read the data from the InputStream\nint bytesRead;\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\nwhile ((bytesRead = mtomStream.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n    // Process the data\n    // ...\n}\n\n// Close the InputStream\nmtomStream.close();\n```\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nThis code snippet demonstrates how to parse an MTOM/XOP SOAP response using the InputStream.read API. It creates a SOAPMessage from the InputStream and retrieves the necessary SOAP elements to access the InputStream containing the MTOM/XOP data. It then reads the data from the InputStream using the InputStream.read method. You can process the data as needed within the while loop. Finally, the InputStream is closed to release any system resources."

The problem is that I use plain HTTP to send soap message and javax.xml for parsing response. But some services responds me with mulipart/related and it    requires much more complex logic to parse it (performance matters). So I wonder may I somehow take advantage of apache cxf, apache axiom or any other library for parsing MTOM/XOP SOAP response?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
