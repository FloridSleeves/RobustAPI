The first instance, coolFile, is used to write the line to the file, but it is not set to append mode. The second instance, file, is set to append mode, but it is not used to write anything to the file.\n\nTo fix this, you can create a single instance of PrintWriter and pass the FileWriter instance to it. This way, the PrintWriter will be set to append mode and you can use its write methods to add another line to the file."

I know its probably a easy fix... I'm learning.. Thank you!\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
