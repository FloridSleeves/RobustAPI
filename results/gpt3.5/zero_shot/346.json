If the value of an entry (Conf object) has been garbage collected, we remove that entry from the map using the iterator's remove() method.\n\nYou can call this method periodically or whenever you want to clear the key-value pairs of garbage collected instances from the instanceMap.\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The clearGarbageCollectedInstances() method uses an Iterator to iterate over the entries in the instanceMap. It checks if the value of each entry (Conf object) has been garbage collected by calling get() on the WeakReference. If the Conf object is null, it means it has been garbage collected, and we remove that entry from the map using the iterator's remove() method. This way, we can automatically clear the key-value pairs of garbage collected instances from the instanceMap."
