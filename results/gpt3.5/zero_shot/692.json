Writing refers to creating or modifying a file, while reading refers to retrieving data from a file.\n\nThe PrintWriter class is used for writing formatted text to a file. It provides methods for writing various data types and strings to a file. Here's an example of how to use PrintWriter:\n\n```java\nimport java.io.File;\nimport java.io.FileNotFoundException;\nimport java.io.PrintWriter;\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class FileExample {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        try {\n            // Create a PrintWriter object to write to a file\n            PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"output.txt\");\n\n            // Read the input file using a Scanner\n            File inputFile = new File(\"input.txt\");\n            Scanner scanner = new Scanner(inputFile);\n\n            // Read each line from the input file and write it to the output file\n            while (scanner.hasNextLine()) {\n                String line = scanner.nextLine();\n\n                // Modify the line as needed (e.g., double space, add indents)\n                String modifiedLine = line + \"\\n\\n\"; // double space\n\n                // Write the modified line to the output file\n                writer.write(modifiedLine);\n            }\n\n            // Close the PrintWriter and Scanner\n            writer.close();\n            scanner.close();\n\n            System.out.println(\"File successfully written.\");\n        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {\n            System.out.println(\"File not found.\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we create a PrintWriter object named \"writer\" to write to a file named \"output.txt\". We then use a Scanner object to read each line from the input file named \"input.txt\". We modify each line as needed (e.g., adding double space) and write the modified line to the output file using the `writer.write()` method.\n\nThe FileWriter class, as mentioned in the link you provided, is another option for writing to a file. It is similar to PrintWriter but provides fewer formatting options. Both classes can be used to write to a file, but PrintWriter offers more flexibility for formatting the output.\n\nI hope this explanation helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."

For reading a file I know you can use Scanner and read it and then print it. However reading a file and then printing it in a new format, like double space, indents, basically any spacing issues, is that also considered reading it or is it writing it? From my understanding of what my teacher has taught me, is that writing overwrites the original document and replaces it. Also how does one use the PrintWriter command? I have never seen this before in my class nor have read about it in my textbook but its on my test according to my teacher. Could someone give an explanation and an example about it? I read this site http://www.caveofprogramming.com/frontpage/articles/java/java-file-reading-and-writing-files-in-java/ on writing files, but it uses FileWriter, which I'm assuming takes the place of scanner? Is that right?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
