If so, we add the delimiter to the delimiters ArrayList and the delimiter index to the delimiterIndices ArrayList.\n- We increment the delimiter index by 2 since the token is always at an even index.\n- Finally, we can use the token index to easily get the corresponding delimiter index by adding 1 to it. We can then retrieve the delimiter from the delimiters ArrayList using the delimiter index."

The tokens go to an ArrayList, and the delimiters go to another. For example:this + is - an * inputThis sentence would be tokenized so that \"this\", \"is\", \"an\" and \"input\" would go to the token array while \"+\", \"-\" and \"*\" go to the delimiters array. Now, I need to store the original indices of these as well, so that the tokens would have indices 0, 2, 4 and 6 and the deliminators would have indices 1, 3 and 5. The normal solution would be to put them into the same array, but I need to keep them separated for performance reasons (e.g. to quickly check through the delimiters).How could this indexing be done so that when I have a token index 'i', I could easily get the deliminator from index 'i+1' without looping through all the delimiters?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
