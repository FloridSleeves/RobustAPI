Then, you can use the getIntent().getStringExtra(\"something\") method to retrieve the value that was sent via the putExtra() method.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use this in the receiving activity:\n\n```\nIntent intent = getIntent();\nString value = intent.getStringExtra(\"something\");\n\nif (value.equals(\"a\")) {\n    setContentView(R.layout.a_layout);\n} else if (value.equals(\"b\")) {\n    setContentView(R.layout.b_layout);\n}\n```\n\nThis code checks the value received from the putExtra() method and sets the content view accordingly using the setContentView() method. If the value is \"a\", it sets the content view to R.layout.a_layout. If the value is \"b\", it sets the content view to R.layout.b_layout.\n\nNote that you need to make sure that the layout files a_layout.xml and b_layout.xml exist in your project's resources."
