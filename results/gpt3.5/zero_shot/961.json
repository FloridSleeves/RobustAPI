In this example, we use the pipe name `\\\\.\\pipe\\myNamedPipe`. After creating the file, you can write data to the named pipe using the `Files.write` method and passing the pipe name as a `Path` object and the message as a byte array obtained from `String.getBytes()`."

Thus I would like to know how to create a named pipe in Windows from Java. In Linux I can use mkfifo (called using Runtime.exec() ), but how should I do this on Windows?\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:"
