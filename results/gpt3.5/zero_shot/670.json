To write the actual value as text, you can use the PrintWriter class. The PrintWriter.write method writes a single character, so you can use the PrintWriter.print method instead to write the double value as text."

I actually wanna write a binary file. In MATLAB I am simply calling:fwrite(filename, A, precision)How could I achieve the same in JAVA?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
