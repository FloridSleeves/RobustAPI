In your code, you can use this method to retrieve the polynomial coefficient at index i by assigning it to the variable x. The updated code would be:\n\npublic static double f(int i, double polynomialCoefficient) {\n    if (i == 0) {\n        return polynomialCoefficient;\n    }\n    double x = polynomialCoefficients.get(i);\n    return polynomialCoefficient * (Math.pow(x, i));\n}"

For example if the input data is 2, 4, 8, 9 then the function would be 2 + 4x + 8x^2 + 9x^3.Now I do know how to process the input data etc. but I don't know how to declare a variable that has no value, for example I declared a variable x = double, but I still have to initialize it but I don't want to give x a value at this point yet?So how can I write a method that for example returns 'x' to the power of something?This is what I have at the moment (it still doesn't work of course)public class Interpol {public static void main(String []args) {    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);        //get user input (polynomial coefficients and interval values x1 and x2)        ArrayList<Double> polynomialCoefficients = new ArrayList<Double>();        int amountCoefficients = 0;        while (scanner.hasNextDouble()) {            polynomialCoefficients.add(scanner.nextDouble());            amountCoefficients++;        }        String in = scanner.next();        double x1 = scanner.nextDouble();        double x2 = scanner.nextDouble();        //call method f to determine the polynomial function        double x;        double[] termsFunction = new double[amountCoefficients];        for (int i = 0; i < polynomialCoefficients.size(); i++) {            termsFunction[i] = f(i, polynomialCoefficients.get(i));        }        //call method findaroot to determine the root        //print result}//determine function of which a root is to be foundpublic static double f(int i, double polynomialCoefficient) {    if (i == 0) {        return polynomialCoefficient;    }    double x;    return polynomialCoefficient * (Math.pow(x, i));}/*  //rounds off d to 3 decimals public static double rnd(double d) {}//returns a root in this interval, recursive function public static double findaroot{double x1, double x2) {}*/}\nPlease using this api: List.get.\nAnswer:"
