However, the `CipherInputStream` does not provide the entire decrypted data at once, but rather in chunks. \n\nTo properly read the decrypted data from the `CipherInputStream`, you should use the `read()` method of the `InputStream` class. The `read()` method reads the next byte of data from the input stream and returns it as an integer value. You can then process the data in chunks by reading it into a buffer.\n\nIn the provided code snippet, a buffer of size 1024 bytes is created. The `read()` method is called on the `decryptStream` to read data into the buffer. The `read()` method returns the number of bytes read, or -1 if the end of the stream has been reached. The loop continues until the end of the stream is reached.\n\nYou can then process the data in the buffer as needed."

I create an CipherInputStream using an encrypting JCE cipher which I then use to create another CipherInputStream using a different decrypting JCE cipher.When I try to read then second stream all I get is empty data. I found no documentation forbidding the above behavior. Does anyone know what the problem is?This is the code which I am running, at the end plainText is empty (the same issue persists regardless of what SecurityProvider I use).InputStream payload = new ByteArrayInputStream(payloadArray);Cipher encryptCipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES\", \"SunJCE\");encryptCipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key, IV);InputStream encryptStream = new CipherInputStream(payload, encryptCipher);Cipher decryptCipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES\", \"SunJCE\");decryptCipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, key, IV);InputStream decryptStream = new CipherInputStream(encryptStream, decryptCipher);byte[] plainText = IOUtisl.toByteArray(decryptStream);Thanks!\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
