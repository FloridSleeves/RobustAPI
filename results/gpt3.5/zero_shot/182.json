However, since .sh files are typically executed in a Unix/Linux environment, you need to use the `cmd /c` command to run the .sh file using the Windows command prompt. The `InputStream.read` API is not directly used in this code snippet, but it can be used to read the output of the executed command. The code snippet above executes the `stopTH.sh` file and reads the output of the command using an `InputStream` and a `BufferedReader`. The output is then printed to the console."
