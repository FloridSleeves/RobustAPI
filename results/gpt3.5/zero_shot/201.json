Here's an example of how you can write the server part to handle client requests:\n\nServer code:\n```java\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.io.InputStream;\nimport java.net.ServerSocket;\nimport java.net.Socket;\n\npublic class Server {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        try {\n            ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(1234); // Choose a port number\n            \n            while (true) {\n                Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept(); // Wait for a client to connect\n                \n                // Handle client request in a separate thread\n                Thread clientThread = new Thread(() -> {\n                    try {\n                        InputStream inputStream = clientSocket.getInputStream();\n                        \n                        // Read data from the client\n                        byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\n                        int bytesRead;\n                        while ((bytesRead = inputStream.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n                            String data = new String(buffer, 0, bytesRead);\n                            System.out.println(\"Received data from client: \" + data);\n                        }\n                        \n                        // Close the client socket\n                        clientSocket.close();\n                    } catch (IOException e) {\n                        e.printStackTrace();\n                    }\n                });\n                clientThread.start();\n            }\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nClient code:\n```java\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.io.OutputStream;\nimport java.net.Socket;\n\npublic class Client {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        try {\n            Socket socket = new Socket(\"localhost\", 1234); // Connect to the server\n            \n            OutputStream outputStream = socket.getOutputStream();\n            \n            // Send data to the server\n            String data = \"Hello, server!\";\n            outputStream.write(data.getBytes());\n            \n            // Close the socket\n            socket.close();\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the server listens for client connections on port 1234. When a client connects, a new thread is created to handle the client request. The server reads data from the client using the InputStream.read method and prints it to the console. The client connects to the server and sends a string \"Hello, server!\".\n\nNote that this is a basic example and does not handle multiple clients or error conditions. It's recommended to add error handling and proper resource management in a real-world application."

The server is connected to a database.Ok, sorry for that, it's a classic question I'm sure, but I don't know how to start.In a project I worked for they implemented a lot of magic with Proxy.newProxyInstance() to invoke the Glassfish server transparently.I don't want to use a Glassfish server. I just want something simple in plain Java. But the concept of proxies seems pretty cool.Do you have ideas or examples of such thing? How do I write the server part to handle the requests of clients?Thanks in advanceFluminis\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
