To ensure that the changes are saved permanently, you can use the PrintWriter.write method instead. This method writes a string to the file and automatically flushes the data. By using this method, the changes should be saved permanently even after closing the program."

So far, there haven't been any errors with accessing it. However, when I close the program or after when the files should have been written when I open the text file I don't find them there, however I did check the bin folder ocne and it seemed to print hello world to the temp copy there. I want the changes it makes to be permanent.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
