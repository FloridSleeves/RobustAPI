In your code, you have not specified the type of elements, so the compiler does not know what type of object it.next() will return. To fix this error, you need to specify the type of elements when creating the Iterator instance. For example, if you are iterating over a set of Strings, you can use Iterator<String> it = this.iterator();."

Iterator it = this.iterator();E next = it.next();next() returns a generic type E and next is of type E. Why is it giving me the error?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
