I am fetching the application info using below code. For example to check whether google maps is installed or not, I am using its package name as shown below.         ApplicationInfo info1 = getPackageManager().        getApplicationInfo(\"com.google.android.apps.maps\", 0 );My question is , if at all this package name is changed by google in future, I will have to update the package name and then send an update to users... Other than checking from package name - Is there any other way to get to know if an application is installed or not? Kindly Help! Thanks!  \nPlease using this api: ApplicationInfo.loadIcon.\nAnswer:"
