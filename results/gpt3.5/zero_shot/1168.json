The StringTokenizer class provides a convenient way to tokenize a string by specifying a delimiter. In this case, the default delimiter is used, which is any whitespace character. \n\nThe code initializes a StringTokenizer object with the input string. It then creates an array of strings with the size equal to the number of tokens in the input string (i.e., the number of words). \n\nA while loop is used to iterate through each token (word) in the StringTokenizer object. The word is then stored in the array at the current index. After each iteration, the index is incremented to move to the next position in the array. \n\nFinally, the array of words is returned as the result."

This is what I have came up with so far:// split takes some string as the argument, and returns the array// whose elements are the words in the stringpublic static String[] split (String s){    // determine the number of words    java.util.Scanner t = new java.util.Scanner (s);    int countWords = 0;    String w;    while (t.hasNext ())    {        w = t.next ();        countWords++;    }    // create appropriate array and store the string\u2019s words in it    // code here}As you can see, I can just input each word via Scanner. Now I just have to put all the words of the String into an array as the elements. However, I'm not sure how to proceed.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
