It searches for the magic number of a GZIP section (`0x1f 0x8b`) and calculates the size of the section by subtracting the position of the magic number from the total number of bytes read in the current buffer. The code continues reading the input stream until the end, accumulating the section size as it finds more GZIP sections. Finally, it returns the total size of all GZIP sections found in the firmware image."

I am able to know the location of the start of the GZIP section using magic number and the GZIPInputStream in Java. However, I need to know the compressed size of the gzip section. GZIPInputStream would return me the uncompressed file size.Is there anybody who has an idea? \nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
