By adding a try-catch block inside the loop, you can handle any exceptions thrown by the `next()` method and continue with the next iteration. This allows you to maintain the syntactic sugar of the foreach loop while handling exceptions."

Occasionally lines will be syntactically bogus, but that doesn't necessarily mean that we shouldn't keep reading the file.My parser implements Iterable, but dealing with the potential exceptions means writingfor (Iterator iter = myParser.iterator(); iter.hasNext(); ) {  try {    MyClass myClass = iter.next();    // .. do stuff ..  } catch (Exception e) {    // .. do exception stuff ..  }}.. nothing wrong with that, but is there any way of getting exception handling on the implicit individual iter.next() calls in the foreach construct?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
