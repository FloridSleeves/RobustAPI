                "content": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: One way to cache the data from the input stream is to read it into a byte array and create new input streams from the byte array whenever needed. Here's an example:\n\n// Read the input stream into a byte array\nByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\nint bytesRead;\nwhile ((bytesRead = inputStream.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n    baos.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);\n}\nbyte[] data = baos.toByteArray();\n\n// Create new input streams from the byte array\nInputStream cachedInputStream1 = new ByteArrayInputStream(data);\nInputStream cachedInputStream2 = new ByteArrayInputStream(data);\n\n// Use the cached input streams with POIFSFileSystem\nPOIFSFileSystem fileSystem1 = new POIFSFileSystem(cachedInputStream1);\nPOIFSFileSystem fileSystem2 = new POIFSFileSystem(cachedInputStream2);\n\n<<<explanation>>>: In this code, we first read the input stream into a byte array using a ByteArrayOutputStream. Then, we create new input streams from the byte array using ByteArrayInputStream. These new input streams can be used with POIFSFileSystem or any other component that requires an input stream.\n\nBy caching the data in a byte array, we can create multiple input streams from the same data without having to reopen the original input stream. This allows us to use the same data with different instances of POIFSFileSystem or other components.\n\nNote that this approach stores the entire contents of the input stream in memory. If the input stream is very large, this may consume a significant amount of memory. In such cases, you may need to consider alternative approaches, such as storing the data in a temporary file instead of memory."

Also is it better to just read up the input stream into an array or string and then create input streams for each use ?EDIT 2:Sorry to reopen the question, but the conditions are somewhat different when working inside desktop and web application. First of all, the InputStream i get from the org.apache.commons.fileupload.FileItem in my tomcat web app doesn't support markings thus cannot reset. Second, I'd like to be able to keep the file in memory for faster acces and less io problems when dealing with files.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
