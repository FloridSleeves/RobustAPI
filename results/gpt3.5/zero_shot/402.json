                "content": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next()\n<<<code>>>: The code provided is using an iterator to iterate over a synchronized list and remove non-applicable actions.\n<<<explanation>>>: The ConcurrentModificationException is occurring because the list is being modified outside of the iterator. Even though the list is synchronized, modifications made outside of the iterator can still cause this exception. In this case, it seems that the list is being modified in the main thread while the iterator is being used in a background thread.\n\nTo fix this issue, you can either use a thread-safe collection that supports concurrent modifications, such as CopyOnWriteArrayList, or synchronize the modifications made in the main thread with the iterator in the background thread. Here's an example of how you can synchronize the modifications:\n\nprotected void removeNonApplicableActions() {\n    synchronized (mActions) {\n        Iterator<IStartAction> iterator = mActions.iterator();\n        while (iterator.hasNext()) {\n            IStartAction action = iterator.next();\n            if (!action.isApplicable()) {\n                iterator.remove();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nBy synchronizing the modifications made in the main thread with the iterator in the background thread, you ensure that the list is not modified while the iterator is being used, preventing the ConcurrentModificationException."
