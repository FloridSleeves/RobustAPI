This causes the file to be overwritten with each iteration, resulting in a new file with zero bytes.\n\nTo fix this issue, you need to move the creation of the output file and the opening of the output channel outside the while loop. Additionally, you need to close the input and output channels after the loop to ensure that all data is properly written and resources are released.\n\nThe corrected code is shown above. It opens the output file and channel before the while loop, and then writes the data from the input channel to the output channel inside the loop. The buffer is flipped before writing and cleared after writing to ensure proper data handling. Finally, the input and output channels are closed after the loop."

I tried reading a file using fileinputstream and file channel. I could not find out the bug in the following code. It runs successfully but file has not been transferred. New file is created with zero bytes.
