In the provided example, we create a custom iterator `MyIterator` that implements the `Iterator<String>` interface. The `next()` method is overridden to return the next element from an array of strings. The `hasNext()` method is also implemented to check if there are more elements to iterate over. In the `main()` method, we create an instance of `MyIterator` and use a while loop to iterate through the elements and print them."

I went through this way: Preferences -> Java -> Compiler -> Errors / Warnings -> Deprecated and Restricted API. Then i changed errors to warnings. But now i can not use that library efficient, cause eclipse suggest me nothing about that library.My first question is; if there is a better way to do that? Or maybe another way to use this library efficient in eclipse?EDIT: I found out it was a complication of 32 and 64 bit versions. After installing 32bit JDK and reference the jai_imageio.jar it worked fine.And second; Can anybody give a plain example to me about converting .bmp image to jpeg2000 image. That would help a lot to me about undesrtanding the context.Thank you\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
