First, create a PrintWriter object with the file name as the parameter. Then, use the print method with an empty string to overwrite the existing content. Finally, flush and close the PrintWriter object.\n\nTo append text multiple times, create a new PrintWriter object with the FileWriter object as the parameter. The FileWriter object should have the file name and the boolean value \"true\" to indicate that you want to append to the file. Use the print method to write the desired text, and then flush and close the PrintWriter object after each write operation."
