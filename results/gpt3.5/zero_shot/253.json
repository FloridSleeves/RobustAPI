In this example, we are reading 3 bytes (24 bits) from the file. We then extract the desired 17 bits from the buffer using bitwise operations.\n\nFirst, we read 3 bytes into a byte array called `buffer` using `inputStream.read(buffer)`. The `read` method returns the number of bytes actually read, so we can check if we have enough bytes to extract the desired 17 bits.\n\nNext, we use bitwise operations to extract the 17 bits from the buffer. We shift the bits of the first byte 9 positions to the left (`(buffer[0] & 0xFF) << 9`), the bits of the second byte 1 position to the left (`(buffer[1] & 0xFF) << 1`), and the bits of the third byte 7 positions to the right (`(buffer[2] & 0xFF) >> 7`). We then combine these shifted bits using bitwise OR (`|`) to get the final 17-bit value.\n\nFinally, we print the binary representation of the extracted bits using `Integer.toBinaryString(bits)`.\n\nDon't forget to close the input stream after you're done reading from the file."
