We initialize a count variable to keep track of the number of transitions. We start by getting the first element from the iterator using `iterator.next()` and assign it to the `previous` variable. Then, we enter a loop that continues as long as there are more elements in the collection. Inside the loop, we get the next element using `iterator.next()` and assign it to the `current` variable. We compare `current` with `previous` to check if there has been a transition. If there is a transition, we increment the `count` variable. Finally, we update the `previous` variable with the `current` value and continue to the next iteration. After the loop ends, we print the value of `count`, which represents the number of transitions."
