In the given code, `i` is an iterator object that is used to iterate over the vertices returned by the query `ograph.getVertices(\"SPECIAL-NODE\", \"SPECIAL\")`. \n\nIn the first line of code, `System.out.println(i.next())`, the `next()` method is called to retrieve the next vertex from the iterator and then it is printed out using `System.out.println()`.\n\nIn the second line of code, `System.out.println(\"SPECIAL NODE: \" + ograph.getVertexByKey(\"SPECIAL-NODE\", \"SPECIAL\"))`, the `getVertexByKey()` method is used to directly retrieve the vertex with the specified key. However, this method does not return an iterator, but rather returns the vertex object directly. Therefore, calling `next()` on it will result in an error.\n\nTo fix the second line of code, you can directly print out the vertex object without using `next()`:\n\n```\nSystem.out.println(\"SPECIAL NODE: \" + ograph.getVertexByKey(\"SPECIAL-NODE\", \"SPECIAL\"));\n```"

The OrientDB contains one unique node with the property \"SPECIAL-NODE\". I want to query the database for this node and print it out. I have one line of code that works using an iterator (see below) and one that does not (below at bottom). It seems like both should work yet only the first does, the second does not. Why is this the case?Thanks!// create Orient graph object and connect to database, works successfullyOrientGraph ograph = new OrientGraph(\"remote:localhost/test\", \"username\", \"password\");// this WORKS - finds the one special node and prints it outIterator<Vertex> i =ograph.getVertices(\"SPECIAL-NODE\", \"SPECIAL\").iterator();System.out.println(i.next());// this DOES NOT WORK. WHY???System.out.println(\"SPECIAL NODE: \" + ograph.getVertexByKey(\"SPECIAL-NODE\",   \"SPECIAL\"));\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
