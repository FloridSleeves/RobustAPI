However, you are not updating the StringTokenizer object when you move to the next line. This is why you are getting a NoSuchElementException.\n\nTo fix this issue, you need to create a new StringTokenizer object for each line inside the outer loop. This way, the StringTokenizer will be initialized with the current line and you can use it to tokenize the line and check for the desired string.\n\nI have updated your code to create a new StringTokenizer object inside the outer loop and use it to tokenize each line. The inner loop checks if the token is equal to the desired string. If it is, the loop breaks and moves to the next line."

But every time I run the code I get no such element exception, i don't understand why?try {        FileReader fr = new FileReader(file);        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);        String line = br.readLine();        String id = new String();        StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(line, \",\");        while(line != null){            while(!id.equals(args[0])){                line = br.readLine();                id = st.nextToken();            }        }    } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {        System.out.println(\"file not found\");    } catch (IOException e) {        System.out.println(\"not a string\");    }The file looks something like this:line1: 118, s, m, pline2: 111, s, m, c\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
