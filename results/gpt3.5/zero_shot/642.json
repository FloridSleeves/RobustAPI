If a match is found, you can retrieve the corresponding key.\n\nHere's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to find the key from a value in a Map:\n\n```java\nMap<String, Integer> wordCountMap = new HashMap<>();\n// Populate the wordCountMap with word counts\n\nint desiredValue = 5; // The value you want to find the key for\n\nString desiredKey = null;\nfor (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : wordCountMap.entrySet()) {\n    if (entry.getValue() == desiredValue) {\n        desiredKey = entry.getKey();\n        break;\n    }\n}\n\nif (desiredKey != null) {\n    System.out.println(\"Key for value \" + desiredValue + \": \" + desiredKey);\n} else {\n    System.out.println(\"No key found for value \" + desiredValue);\n}\n```\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nIn the code snippet above, we first define a desiredValue variable which represents the value we want to find the key for. Then, we iterate over the entries of the wordCountMap using a for-each loop. For each entry, we check if the value matches the desiredValue. If a match is found, we store the corresponding key in the desiredKey variable and break out of the loop.\n\nAfter the loop, we check if a key was found by checking if desiredKey is not null. If a key was found, we print it along with the desiredValue. If no key was found, we print a message indicating that no key was found for the desiredValue."

I am building a word counter in Java using Map<String, Integer> where a word is the String and the amount of times that word was said in a .txt document is Integer. This is all working great...but I am trying to develop a part where it will display at the bottom what the top 5 results are ---> what the top 5 map.values() are.The problem I have run into is after I find the value, I can't get the String with it.Any suggestions would be very helpful to me.\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:"
