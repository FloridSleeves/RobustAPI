                "content": "<<<api>>>: Apache POI\n<<<code>>>: \n1. First, you need to add the Apache POI dependency to your project. You can do this by adding the following Maven dependency to your pom.xml file:\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>org.apache.poi</groupId>\n    <artifactId>poi</artifactId>\n    <version>4.1.2</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n\n2. Once you have added the dependency, you can start using Apache POI to parse the Excel data. Here's a sample code snippet to get you started:\n\n```java\nimport org.apache.poi.ss.usermodel.*;\nimport org.apache.poi.xssf.usermodel.XSSFWorkbook;\n\nimport java.io.FileInputStream;\nimport java.io.IOException;\n\npublic class ExcelParser {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        try (FileInputStream file = new FileInputStream(\"path/to/your/excel/file.xlsx\")) {\n            Workbook workbook = new XSSFWorkbook(file);\n            Sheet sheet = workbook.getSheetAt(0); // Assuming the data is in the first sheet\n\n            Iterator<Row> rowIterator = sheet.iterator();\n            while (rowIterator.hasNext()) {\n                Row row = rowIterator.next();\n                Iterator<Cell> cellIterator = row.cellIterator();\n                while (cellIterator.hasNext()) {\n                    Cell cell = cellIterator.next();\n                    // Process the cell data here\n                    System.out.println(cell.toString());\n                }\n            }\n\n            workbook.close();\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n3. In the above code, you first create a FileInputStream object to read the Excel file. Then, you create a Workbook object using the XSSFWorkbook class for .xlsx files. Next, you get the first sheet from the workbook using the getSheetAt() method. \n\n4. You can then iterate over the rows and cells using the iterator() method of the Sheet and Row classes, respectively. You can access the cell data using the Cell class and perform your calculations on it.\n\n5. Finally, don't forget to close the workbook to release any system resources.\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The code snippet provided demonstrates how to use Apache POI to parse an Excel file in Java. It uses the XSSFWorkbook class for .xlsx files and iterates over the rows and cells using iterators. You can access the cell data using the Cell class and perform your calculations on it."
