Because collections do not guarantee consistent ordering, there is no first() or get(int index) methods, so I need to use rather ugly things, such as:public Integer sillyExample(Collection<Integer> collection){    if(collection.size()==1){        return collection.iterator().next();    }    return someCodeToDecideBetweenElements(collection);}So, how do you get the only element out? I can't believe there isn't a better way...Please note, I understand there's no concept of \"first\", I'm just trying to avoid building an iterator when I know there is only one element in it.EDIT: Peter Wooster found a very similar question here. I'm leaving this open because I'm not trying to get the \"first\" element, which would imply a consistent ordering, but the \"one and only\" element after checking that it indeed is the only element.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
