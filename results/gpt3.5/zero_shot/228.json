Here's an example of how you can achieve this using the `InputStream.read` API:\n\n1. On the server side, when a client wants to send a file, the client sends a message to the server indicating that a file transfer is about to start. The server then opens a new thread to handle the file transfer.\n\n2. In the file transfer thread, the server creates a new `ServerSocket` on a separate port and listens for incoming file transfer connections.\n\n3. The server sends the port number of the file transfer socket to the client over the original text message connection.\n\n4. On the client side, when it receives the port number for the file transfer socket, it opens a new `Socket` to connect to the server's file transfer socket.\n\n5. The client reads the file from disk using `FileInputStream` and sends it to the server over the file transfer socket using `OutputStream.write`.\n\n6. On the server side, the file transfer thread accepts the incoming connection from the client and reads the file data from the client's socket input stream using `InputStream.read`.\n\n7. The server can then process the received file data as needed.\n\n8. Meanwhile, the main server thread can continue to handle text messages from other clients over the original text message connection.\n\n9. To differentiate between text messages and file transfers, you can define a protocol or message format that includes a message type field in the message header.\n\n10. The server can use this message type field to determine whether the incoming message is a text message or a file transfer request.\n\n<<<explanation>>>:\nBy using a separate thread on the server side to handle the file transfer, you can keep the original text message connection open and receive both text messages and file transfers simultaneously over a single port. The `InputStream.read` API can be used to read the file data from the client's socket input stream in the file transfer thread."

This is working great and I am able to send \"text\" messages back and forth to the server without a problem. Like a chat system.Now I have in mind a way to be able to send files across these client connections to the server, but every single example I see in java always has a hard-coded file name on server / client side - but I want to set my own for flexibility. And I would love if it were not only able to not only receive files but also receive \"text\" messages on the same port simulatanously.I have an idea whereby the \"text\" message port I have at the moment, tells the server a file is going to be sent from a client, then the server opens up a \"file transfer\" port, just for file transfers. That way the \"text\" port could specify the name etc of the file. And the other port could send the files quite happily, without interruption.Does anyone know a better way to do this though? I don't really want to use two ports, it seems a bit messy. I would prefer to make a separate thread on the server side to deal with the file transfer and also deal with \"text\" message at the same time, if this is even possible?Thanks in advance, I hope I have been clear enough :)\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
