The Direction enum uses this iterator to implement the next() method.\n\nThe CyclicIterator maintains an internal currentIndex that keeps track of the current element in the list. When next() is called, it returns the element at the currentIndex and updates the currentIndex to the next index in a cyclic manner using the modulo operator.\n\nBy using this approach, we can achieve cyclic traversal over the enum without having to manually handle the logic of switching between directions in a switch statement."
