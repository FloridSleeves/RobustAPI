In this case, the delimiter is a comma (\",\"). \n\nFirst, we create a `StringTokenizer` object by passing the input string and the delimiter to its constructor. \n\nThen, we use the `nextToken()` method to retrieve the next token from the string. Since we want to get two values, we call `nextToken()` twice. \n\nWe also use the `trim()` method to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the tokens. \n\nFinally, we assign the tokens to two separate variables (`stringOne` and `stringTwo`) for further use."
