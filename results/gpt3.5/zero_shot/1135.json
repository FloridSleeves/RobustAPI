It looks like this:Shoes 10.00Jersey 20.00Cookies 15.00Light Bulbs 2.00Paper 5.00I want to map every item to how much it costs and my current code works just fine. However, it looks a bit clunky and initializes variables with null that my project's submission server doesn't like and treats as a bug. I'm looking for a way to translate this into something a lot more elegant and thus learn to read files another way apart from relying on the Scanner class. Maybe using BufferedReader or PrintReader or something of the ilk that I have never really grasped. Help appreciated.    private TreeMap<String, Double> prices = new TreeMap<String, Double>();     public void readFromFile(String fileName){                File file = new File(fileName);                Scanner sc = null; //Server treats this as a bug.                 try {                    sc = new Scanner(file);                } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {                    e.printStackTrace();                }                while (sc.hasNextLine()) {                    Scanner sc2 = new Scanner(sc.nextLine());                    while (sc2.hasNext()) {                        String s = sc2.next(); //Gets the item name                        prices.put(s, Double.parseDouble(sc2.next())); //The next word is the price                        }                    sc2.close();                    }}\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
