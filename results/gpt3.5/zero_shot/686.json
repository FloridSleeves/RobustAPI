After successful login, you can then send a GET request to the file download URL and save the downloaded file.\n\nIn the provided code, we first create a `URL` object with the login URL and open a connection to it using `HttpURLConnection`. We set the request method to POST and enable input and output streams. We then set the request parameters (username and password) and write them to the output stream using a `PrintWriter` object.\n\nAfter sending the POST request, we check the response code to determine if the login was successful. If it is, we create another `URL` object with the file download URL and open a connection to it. We set the request method to GET and get the input stream from the file connection.\n\nWe then create a `FileOutputStream` object to save the downloaded file and read the input stream in chunks, writing them to the file. Finally, we close the input stream and file output stream, and print a success message.\n\nIf the login fails, we print an error message."

I've tried logging in using Internet Explorer and download using that session but it didn't work. So I'm guessing I need to POST user data to the web, get an answer and download the file.How can I create a session wtih Java and download the file? Thank you in advance.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
