My data format is a INT, DOUBLE, and INT[] and here's how I did it at first//to convert to stringString[] message = { Integer.toString(number), String.valueOf(double), Arrays.toString(my_list) };message.asString;//to convert backString message_without_brackets = message.replace(\"[\", \"\" ).replace(\"]\", \"\");String[] temp_message = message_without_brackets.split(\",\"); int interger = Integer.valueOf(temp_message[0]);double double = Double.valueOf(temp_message[1]);int[] my_list = new int[temp_message.length-2]; //-2 because the first two entries are other datafor (int i = 2; i < temp_message.length; i++) {    my_list[i-2] = Integer.parseInt(temp_message[i].replace(\" \",\"\"));}This is super ugly and it annoyed me that after a few weeks(or a single night of heavy drinking) I would probably not be able to figure out this quickly.  Performance wise the code wasn't too bad, I think replace was the heaviest part of the code(if I remember it was like 15% of overall execution).I asked around and found Gson to be able to do this cleaner but the performance is now over 40% of my loop now(its Gson itself thats doing it):    Gson gson = new Gson();    int[] sub = { 0, 59, 16 };    Object[] values = { 0, 43.0, sub };    String output = gson.toJson(values); // => [0, 43.0,[0,59,16]]    Object[] deserialized = gson.fromJson(output, Object[].class);    System.out.println(deserialized[0]);    System.out.println(deserialized[1]);    System.out.println(deserialized[2]);So I'm wondering if there's faster way to get the same result?I am trying out a few of the suggestions in this question but is there a faster way to do this without depending on any external libraries as my needs are quite simple(if not, then is there a fast one)?  Because someone suggested Gson, I looked at Json parsers, but is that what I should be looking for or is are there other types of libraries that do this?EDIT: I am converting it to string because I thought I needed to do that to send it as getBytes(), is there any other format that would be faster that I can use getBytes() on?\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:"
