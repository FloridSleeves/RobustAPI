It then creates a new File object with the specified directory path and file name, and uses the write method of the item to write the file to the specified directory. The comment \"// Process the input stream...\" indicates that you need to add your own logic to process the input stream, such as reading the file content or performing any necessary operations on the file."

I am stuck trying to figure out how to get the file extension of the uploaded file, how to write the file to a directory and the worst part is where the person who wrote the example comments // Process the input stream... It leaves me wondering if it's something so trivial that I'm the only one  who doesn't know how to. \nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
