In your for loop, you are creating a new iterator for each iteration, which means that you are always getting the first shape in the list. To fix this, you need to move the iterator creation outside of the for loop and call `iter.next()` inside the loop to get the next shape in the list. Here's the corrected code:\n\n```java\npublic void printShapes(ArrayList<String> numbers){\n    Iterator<Shape> iter = this.shapes.iterator();\n    for(String s:numbers){\n        Shape shape = iter.next();\n        shape.printMe(s);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWith this change, the output will be:\n\n```\nThis is Circle no: 1\nThis is Square no: 2\nThis is Triangle no: 3\n```"
