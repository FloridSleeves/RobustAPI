First, obtain an instance of the PackageManager by calling getPackageManager() method. Then, call the getInstalledApplications() method on the PackageManager instance, passing 0 as the argument to retrieve all installed applications. This method returns a List of ApplicationInfo objects representing the installed applications. You can iterate over this list and retrieve the application label using the getApplicationLabel() method from the PackageManager. Finally, you can log or display the application names as desired."
