Here's an example:\n\n```java\nHashMap<Integer, String> DocsCollection = new HashMap<Integer, String>();\n\n// Initialize the HashMap with the first entry\nDocsCollection.put(1, \"foo.txt\");\n\n// Search for the word \"Hello\" in a file\nString word = \"Hello\";\nString file = \"hello.txt\";\n\n// Check if the word already exists in the HashMap\nif (DocsCollection.containsValue(word)) {\n    // Get the key for the existing word\n    int key = getKeyByValue(DocsCollection, word);\n    \n    // Get the current value for the key\n    String value = DocsCollection.get(key);\n    \n    // Concatenate the new file to the existing value\n    value += \",\" + file;\n    \n    // Update the value for the key\n    DocsCollection.put(key, value);\n} else {\n    // Increment the counter in key\n    int key = DocsCollection.size() + 1;\n    \n    // Add the new file in the value\n    DocsCollection.put(key, file);\n}\n\n// Helper method to get the key by value\npublic static <K, V> K getKeyByValue(Map<K, V> map, V value) {\n    for (Map.Entry<K, V> entry : map.entrySet()) {\n        if (value.equals(entry.getValue())) {\n            return entry.getKey();\n        }\n    }\n    return null;\n}\n```\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nIn the given code, we first initialize the HashMap `DocsCollection` with the first entry using the key `1` and the value `\"foo.txt\"`. Then, we search for the word \"Hello\" in a file and check if it already exists in the HashMap using the `containsValue` method. If it exists, we retrieve the key for the existing word using the helper method `getKeyByValue`. We then get the current value for the key and concatenate the new file to the existing value. Finally, we update the value for the key using the `put` method. If the word does not exist in the HashMap, we increment the counter in the key and add the new file in the value using the `put` method. The helper method `getKeyByValue` is used to find the key based on the value in the HashMap."

It begins with \"1\" but when I find the word second time , the key increments and then the put method inserts a new entry with a new keyBut i would like to have only one entry and modify the key.Can this be done?How can i have only one object in a HashMap and modify the key every time?   DocsCollection.put(2,\"foo.txt,hello.txt\"); Thanks, in advance\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:"
