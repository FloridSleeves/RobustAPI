Decompress the string using a decompression algorithm (e.g., pako.js).\n4. Parse the decompressed string as JSON.\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nIn Java, you can use the String.getBytes() method to convert a string to bytes. This method encodes the string using the platform's default charset. You can then compress the string using a compression algorithm like GZIP. After compressing the string, you can convert it back to bytes using the String.getBytes() method.\n\nIn JavaScript, you can receive the compressed bytes from the server and convert them to a string using the TextDecoder API. The TextDecoder API allows you to specify the encoding of the bytes. Once you have the string, you can use a decompression algorithm like pako.js to decompress it. Finally, you can parse the decompressed string as JSON.\n\nNote: This is a high-level overview of the process. You will need to implement the specific compression and decompression algorithms in your code."

Improve this question                    I have a large amount of data being sent from server to Javascript, which is taking quite a long time to load.I was wondering how I can implement compression at server and decompression in Javascript. I would appreciate any help.\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:"
