In this example, we create an `InputStream` object from the web service and a `ByteArrayOutputStream` to store the read data. We then create a buffer array to read the data in chunks and use a while loop to continuously read from the input stream until there is no more data. Inside the loop, we write the read data to the `ByteArrayOutputStream`. Finally, we convert the `ByteArrayOutputStream` to a byte array using the `toByteArray` method."

I know the structure from some documentation and would like to use that stream as an ObjectInputStream, but before I can call any self made readObject methods, this approach fails, due to java.io.StreamCorruptedException: invalid stream header. What's the best way to populate java objects from such a byte stream?BTW: Data is coming in as LittleEndian, texts as 16bit chars preceeded by 4 byte size info, e.g.   03 00 00 00 41 00 62 00 63 00   (hex)would result in \"Abc\"\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
