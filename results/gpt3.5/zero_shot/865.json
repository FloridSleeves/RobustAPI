The RandomAccessFile class allows you to read from or write to a file at a specific position, which makes it suitable for appending data to an existing file.\n\nIn the provided code, a Logger class is created with a RandomAccessFile object. The constructor initializes the RandomAccessFile object with the given file name and \"rw\" mode, which allows both reading and writing to the file.\n\nThe appendMessage method appends a message to the file by first seeking to the end of the file using the `seek` method, and then writing the message bytes to the file using the `write` method.\n\nThe closeFile method is used to close the RandomAccessFile object when you are done appending messages.\n\nBy using this approach, you can append messages to the encrypted file without having to decrypt it every time. However, please note that this code does not handle encryption or decryption. You will need to implement the encryption and decryption logic separately."

Unfortunately, cryptography is not my strong side. Now I can write to file several messages and then close file. Then i can open it, append some messages, close again and after decryption I see padding bytes in the middle of file. Is there any way to work with encrypted file without having to decrypt it every time I want to append some messages?EDIT: little more details. Current implementation utlizes CipherOutputStream. As i understand there's no way to seek using it.Can i use 'NoPadding' option if i will control that output data size is divisible by block size?\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.write.\nAnswer:"
