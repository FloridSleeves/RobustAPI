After reading each line from the input file, you can convert the line to uppercase using the toUpperCase() method. Then, you can use the outputFile.write method to write the uppercase line to the new file. Additionally, you can use the System.lineSeparator() method to write a new line character after each line to separate them in the new file. Finally, make sure to close the outputFile after writing all the lines."

Below is part of the code (specifically the loop): // Read lines from the file until no more are left.  while (inputFile.hasNext())  {      // Read the next name.     String friendName = inputFile.nextLine();      // Need line to make all letters uppercase  }  System.out.print(\"Enter the saved file name: \");  String filename2 = keyboard.nextLine();When I run it now: I am able to open the first text file and a second txt file is created, but there is no letters in the new file. \nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
