To solve the second issue, you can use the read(byte[] b) method instead of the read() method.\nHere is an example of how you can modify your code to solve both issues:\n\nwhile (!Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) {\n    try {\n        int r;\n        byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\n        int bytesRead;\n        String response = \"\";\n        while ((bytesRead = input.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n            for (int i = 0; i < bytesRead; i++) {\n                int value = buffer[i] & 0xFF;\n                if (value == 0) {\n                    // Handle byte value 0\n                } else {\n                    // Handle other byte values\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    ...\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: By using the read(byte[] b) method, you can read multiple bytes at once into a buffer. The bytesRead variable will store the number of bytes actually read. Then, you can iterate over the buffer and handle each byte individually. By using the bitwise AND operator (&) with 0xFF, you can convert the signed byte value to an unsigned integer value between 0 and 255. This will allow you to correctly handle byte values >= 128."

If the client sends me a byte of value 0, it is not received by the server. The second issue is, if the byte value is 128 or more, I keep receiving a value of 65533 or a binary value of 11111101. Anyone knows how to solve these issues. I am a beginner in networking on JAVA.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
