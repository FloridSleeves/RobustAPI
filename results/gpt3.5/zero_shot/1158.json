In this case, we can use the default delimiter which is a space. By calling `st.nextToken()`, we can retrieve the next token from the string. In the given example, we first retrieve the first name token and assign it to the `firstName` variable. Then, we retrieve the number token and assign it to the `number` variable. This way, you can separate the name and number into different variables."
