First, create a PrintWriter object by passing a FileWriter object with the file name and \"true\" as the second argument to indicate that you want to append to the file. Then, use the write() method of the PrintWriter object to write the text you want to append. Finally, close the PrintWriter object to ensure that the changes are saved to the file."
