Inside the for loop, we iterate through the contacts and get the score using the getMP() method. We then use the PrintWriter's write() method to write the score to the string. After writing each score, we check if it is not the last score in the loop and if so, we add a comma to separate the scores. Finally, we flush and close the PrintWriter, and return the string representation of the StringWriter."

It gives a different score every time, which I need to save to a String (or file, but I guess a string would be easier, because I need it to be empty at every new call for the database).I want to store all the scores by going through the loop, and then adding a , after each score (to keep them seperate) but my code isn't working because a part of the code is outside the for loop. How do I fix this? Or are there better/other methods to do what I want to create?DatabaseHandler db = new DatabaseHandler(camera.this);List<Database> contacts = db.getAllContacts();for (Database contact : contacts) {    String test = contact.getMP();    StringWriter stringWriter = new StringWriter();    PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(stringWriter);    printWriter.println(test);}  printWriter.flush();printWriter.close();return stringWriter.toString();\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
