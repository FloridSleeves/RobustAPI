In the provided code, an iterator is created for the String array. The first element is assigned to both min and max variables. Then, the iterator is used to iterate through the remaining elements of the array. For each element, it is compared to the current min and max values using the compareTo method. If the element is smaller than the current min, it becomes the new min. If the element is larger than the current max, it becomes the new max. Finally, the min and max values are printed. This approach allows you to find the minimum and maximum values in a String array using the Iterator.next method."

And how can it be useful in a program?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
