Then, we create two new ArrayLists, greaterList and lesserList, to store the elements that are greater than and less than the first element, respectively.\n\nNext, we create an Iterator object using the iterator() method of the ArrayList. We call the next() method once to skip the first element since we have already compared it.\n\nWe then enter a while loop that iterates through the remaining elements of the ArrayList using the hasNext() method of the Iterator. Inside the loop, we retrieve the next element using the next() method and store it in the variable element.\n\nWe compare the element with the firstElement and add it to the appropriate ArrayList based on the comparison result.\n\nFinally, we have two ArrayLists, greaterList and lesserList, that contain the elements greater than and less than the first element, respectively."
