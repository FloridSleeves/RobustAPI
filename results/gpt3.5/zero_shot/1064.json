Then, I check each token and append it to the StringBuilder if it matches the desired output format (i.e., \"Average\", \"Joe\", or a number). Finally, I return the formatted output as a string. In the main method, I call the read method and print the output to the console."

I'm new to java reading from files, and I don't know how to work with just some parts of what I readHere is the initial file: http://pastebin.com/D0paWtAdAnd I have to write in another file the following output:Average,Joe,44,31,18,12,9,10I've managed just to take everything from the file and print it to output. I would need help just in taking the output I need and print it to the screen. Any help is appreciated.This is what I wrote up to now:public class FileParsing {public static Stringread(String filename) throws IOException {BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"C:\\\\Users\\\\Bogdi\\\\Desktop\\\\example.txt\"));String s;StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();while((s = in.readLine())!= null)   sb.append(s + \"\\n\");in.close();return sb.toString();}\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
