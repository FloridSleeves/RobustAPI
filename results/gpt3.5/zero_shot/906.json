First, convert the string to a byte array using the `String.getBytes()` method. Then, create a `FileOutputStream` object and pass the file name as a parameter. Use the `write()` method of the `FileOutputStream` object to write the byte array to the file. Finally, close the `FileOutputStream` object to release any system resources associated with it."
