Maintain a list of connected clients on the server side.\n2. When a client connects to the server, add its socket to the list of connected clients.\n3. When you want to send a message to a specific client, iterate through the list of connected clients and find the client you want to send the message to.\n4. Get the output stream of the client's socket using `clientSocket.getOutputStream()`.\n5. Create a `DataOutputStream` object using the client's output stream.\n6. Use the `writeUTF()` method of the `DataOutputStream` object to send the message to the specific client.\n\nHere's an example code snippet:\n\n```java\nimport java.io.DataOutputStream;\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.net.ServerSocket;\nimport java.net.Socket;\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.List;\n\npublic class Server {\n    private List<Socket> connectedClients;\n\n    public Server() {\n        connectedClients = new ArrayList<>();\n    }\n\n    public void start(int port) {\n        try {\n            ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(port);\n            System.out.println(\"Server started on port \" + port);\n\n            while (true) {\n                Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();\n                connectedClients.add(clientSocket);\n                System.out.println(\"Client connected: \" + clientSocket.getInetAddress().getHostAddress());\n\n                // Handle client in a separate thread if needed\n                // Thread clientThread = new Thread(new ClientHandler(clientSocket));\n                // clientThread.start();\n            }\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void sendMessageToClient(Socket clientSocket, String message) {\n        try {\n            DataOutputStream outputStream = new DataOutputStream(clientSocket.getOutputStream());\n            outputStream.writeUTF(message);\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Server server = new Server();\n        server.start(1234);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the `sendMessageToClient()` method, you can pass the specific client's socket and the message you want to send. The method will then get the output stream of the client's socket and use the `writeUTF()` method to send the message to that specific client.\n\nNote: This is a simplified example and does not handle disconnections or multiple clients sending messages simultaneously. It's recommended to handle each client in a separate thread or use a thread pool for better scalability."
