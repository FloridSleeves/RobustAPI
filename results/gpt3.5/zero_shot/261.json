                "content": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: To set a virtual number for the online player count, you can use the Iterator.next method to iterate through a collection of players and count them. Here is an example:\n\n```java\nint virtualPlayerCount = 100; // Set your desired virtual player count\n\n// Get the collection of players\nCollection<Player> players = Bukkit.getOnlinePlayers();\n\n// Create an iterator for the collection\nIterator<Player> iterator = players.iterator();\n\n// Count the players using the iterator\nint actualPlayerCount = 0;\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\n    iterator.next();\n    actualPlayerCount++;\n}\n\n// Set the virtual player count\nint virtualMaxPlayers = 200; // Set your desired virtual max player count\nBukkit.getServer().setMaxPlayers(virtualMaxPlayers);\n\n// Set the virtual player count\nBukkit.getServer().getServer().getServerPing().setPlayers(new ServerPing.Players(virtualPlayerCount, actualPlayerCount));\n```\n\n<<<explanation>>>: In the code above, we first set the desired virtual player count using the `virtualPlayerCount` variable. Then, we get the collection of online players using `Bukkit.getOnlinePlayers()`. We create an iterator for the collection using `players.iterator()`. \n\nWe then iterate through the collection using a while loop and the `iterator.next()` method. For each player, we increment the `actualPlayerCount` variable. \n\nAfter counting the players, we set the virtual max player count using `Bukkit.getServer().setMaxPlayers(virtualMaxPlayers)`. Finally, we set the virtual player count using `Bukkit.getServer().getServer().getServerPing().setPlayers(new ServerPing.Players(virtualPlayerCount, actualPlayerCount))`.\n\nNote that this code assumes you are using the Bukkit API for a Minecraft server plugin."

I Thing to set a virtual number for the max Player Count I can use the Method setMaxPlayers(int mxPlayers) from the ServerListPing Event. But what about the online Players? And does it also work if I try to get the Players via a query in a plugin?Thank you for your help and sorry for my bad English ;)\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
