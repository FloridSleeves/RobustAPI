It checks if each line starts with \"#\" to ignore commented lines. If a line is not commented, it splits the line by \"=\" to separate the key and value. The key and value are then trimmed to remove any leading or trailing spaces. You can process the key-value pair as needed."

It is a save game file but I can't use java.util.Properties for this (it is under the specification). I have to read the entire file and ignore commented lines and the keys that are not relevant in some classes. These properties are unique but they may be sorted in any order. My file current file looks like this:# BioplayerOrigin=NewlandsplayerClass=Warlock# ArmorplayerHelmet=emptyplayerUpperArmor=armor900playerBottomArmor=armor457playerBoots=boot109etcThese properties are going to be written and placed according to the player's progress and the filereader would have to reach the end of file and get only the matched keys. I've tried different approaches but so far nothing came close to the results that I would had using java.util.Properties. Any idea?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:"
