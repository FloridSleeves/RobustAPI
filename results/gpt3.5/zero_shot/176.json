Use the InputStream.read method to read the data from the inputstream into the buffer. The method returns the number of bytes read, so you can store this value in a variable called bytesRead.\n\n2. Create a new ByteArrayInputStream using the buffer and the number of bytes read. This ensures that only the actual data read from the inputstream is used to create the ByteArrayInputStream.\n\n3. Continue with the rest of your code as before, using the ByteArrayInputStream instead of the original buffer. This way, you can be sure that you are reading the body data starting from the correct position in the inputstream.\n\nNote: It's important to handle the bytesRead value correctly, as it indicates the actual number of bytes read from the inputstream. This value should be used when creating the ByteArrayInputStream to ensure that only the valid data is used."
