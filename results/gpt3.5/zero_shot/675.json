Instead, you are passing just the file name \"file.txt\" to the PrintWriter constructor, which is causing the FileNotFoundException.\n\nTo fix this, you need to pass the File object to the PrintWriter constructor instead of just the file name. Additionally, you should handle the FileNotFoundException by using a try-catch block.\n\nThe corrected code above creates a File object with the correct path and passes it to the PrintWriter constructor. It then uses the write method of PrintWriter to write the string \"hello\" to the file. Finally, it closes the PrintWriter to ensure that all the data is written to the file."
