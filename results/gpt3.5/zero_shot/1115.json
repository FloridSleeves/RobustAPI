First, you read the entire line of input using BufferedReader. Then, you create a new StringTokenizer object and pass the input line as the parameter. The StringTokenizer class will automatically split the line into tokens based on the space character. You can then use the nextToken() method to retrieve each token. In this case, the first token will be assigned to the variable x as an integer, and the second token will be assigned to the variable y as a string. Finally, you can print the values of x and y using System.out.println()."
