In the custom wrapper, you can modify the request body before it is read by the servlet.\n\nIn the code provided, the XSSFilter class implements the Filter interface and overrides the doFilter() method. Inside the doFilter() method, the HttpServletRequest is cast to an HttpServletRequestWrapper and a new XSSRequestWrapper is created with the original request.\n\nThe XSSRequestWrapper extends HttpServletRequestWrapper and overrides the getInputStream() and getReader() methods. In the getInputStream() method, a new ByteArrayInputStream is created with the modified request body, and a custom ServletInputStream is returned that reads from this ByteArrayInputStream. Similarly, in the getReader() method, a BufferedReader is created with the modified request body.\n\nThe getRequestBody() method is a helper method that reads the original request body and returns it as a String. It uses a BufferedReader to read the request body character by character and appends it to a StringBuilder.\n\nBy using this custom XSSRequestWrapper, you can modify the request body to protect against XSS attacks."
