We create a `ByteBuffer` with a large size to act as a buffer. We iterate over the data to be written, filling the buffer with a portion of the data each time. We then write the buffer to the file channel using the `write` method. This approach reduces disk I/O by writing data in bulk rather than writing each character individually."

Currently, I am using File Writer class. However, it is too slow. Can anybody help me how to perform bulk write in Java like maintaining a large buffer and periodically flush it.\nPlease using this api: FileChannel.write.\nAnswer:"
