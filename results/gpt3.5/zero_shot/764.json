This can lead to incorrect data being written. To fix this, you can use the PrintWriter class, which provides a convenient way to write formatted data to a file. In the updated code, a PrintWriter object is created using the output file. Inside the loop, the integer value is converted to a string using String.valueOf() and then written to the file using the PrintWriter's write() method. Finally, the PrintWriter is closed to ensure that all the data is flushed to the file."

I think it is problem with OutpubStream, because I display data on previous steps, and they were correct.private void Output(File file2) {    // TODO Auto-generated method stub    OutputStream os;    try {        os = new FileOutputStream(file2); //file2-it is my output file, all normal with him        Iterator<Integer> e=mass.iterator();        int r=0;        while(e.hasNext()){            r=e.next();             System.out.println(r);//display data-all be correct        os.write(r);//I think problem create in this step/        }        os.close();    } catch (IOException e) {        // TODO Auto-generated catch block        e.printStackTrace();    }} Input data file1.txt1056233452115685485Output data file2.txt 3 strahge tokens plus !-68DU  thanks for answers, excuse me for my english. \nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
