First, obtain an iterator for the linked list using the `iterator()` method. Then, use a for loop with a condition to check if the iterator has a next element and also limit the loop to a certain number of iterations (in this case, 50). Inside the loop, use the `next()` method of the iterator to get the next element and perform the desired operations. Additionally, you can increment the numerical iterator (`iter2`) to keep track of the number of iterations."
