This causes the file to be overwritten each time, resulting in only one line being written to the file.\n\nTo solve this issue, you should move the creation of the PrintWriter object outside of the loop, and close the PrintWriter after the loop is finished. This way, the file will not be overwritten and all the lines will be written to the file.\n\nI have modified your code to reflect this change. Now, the PrintWriter is created before the loop and closed after the loop. This will ensure that all the lines are written to the file:\n\nMain:\n```java\npackage hu.hymosi.tut;\n\nimport java.io.FileNotFoundException;\nimport java.io.PrintWriter;\nimport java.util.Random;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        PrintWriter out = null;\n        frameworkcucc fw = new frameworkcucc();\n        try {\n            out = new PrintWriter(\"valtozok.txt\");\n        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n        for (int i = 1; i < 100; i++) {\n            Random rand = new Random();\n            System.out.println(i);\n            int kiirando = rand.nextInt();\n            fw.writetotext(kiirando, out);\n        }\n        out.close();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nframeworkcucc:\n```java\npackage hu.hymosi.tut;\n\nimport java.io.PrintWriter;\n\npublic class frameworkcucc {\n    public void writetotext(int write, PrintWriter writer) {\n        writer.write(write + \"\\n\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow, when you run the program, it will write all the lines to the \"valtozok.txt\" file instead of just one line."
