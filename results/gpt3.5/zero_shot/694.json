Create a PrintWriter object and specify the output file and UTF-8 encoding:\nPrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(new FileOutputStream(filename), \"UTF-8\"));\n\n2. Use the write method to write the desired content to the file:\nwriter.write(\"Your content here\");\n\n3. Close the PrintWriter to ensure that all data is flushed and the file is properly closed:\nwriter.close();\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nTo output as UTF-8 encoding in Java, you need to ensure that you are using the correct encoding when writing to the file.
