The `write` method of `FileWriter` does not automatically flush the data to the file, so you need to manually call `flush` after each write. However, the `write` method of `PrintWriter` automatically flushes the data, so you don't need to call `flush` after each write. Additionally, you don't need to use `JOptionPane` to display messages, you can simply use `System.out.println` for debugging purposes."
