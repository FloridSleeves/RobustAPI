                "content": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next()\n<<<code>>>: To refer to the previous and next element during an iteration using an Iterator, you can use the ListIterator interface instead of the regular Iterator interface. The ListIterator provides methods to access the previous and next elements in a collection.\n\nHere's an example:\n\nListIterator<Object> iterator = list.listIterator();\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\n    Object current = iterator.next();\n    Object previous = null;\n    Object next = null;\n    \n    if (iterator.hasPrevious()) {\n        previous = iterator.previous();\n    }\n    \n    if (iterator.hasNext()) {\n        next = iterator.next();\n    }\n    \n    // Perform your code on previous, current, and next elements\n    // ...\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: In the code snippet above, we create a ListIterator using the list.listIterator() method. We then iterate over the collection using the hasNext() method to check if there is a next element. Inside the loop, we use the next() method to get the current element.\n\nTo access the previous element, we use the hasPrevious() method to check if there is a previous element. If there is, we use the previous() method to get the previous element.\n\nTo access the next element, we use the hasNext() method again to check if there is a next element. If there is, we use the next() method to get the next element.\n\nYou can perform your desired code on the previous, current, and next elements as needed."

But when it returns true (so it finds what I look for), it should perform the code on the previous and the next item.  Clarification: I have java.awt.Component elements!\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
