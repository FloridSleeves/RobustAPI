Here's an example of how you can read the Version field:\n\n```java\nInputStream inputStream = // your input stream here\n\nint version = inputStream.read();\n```\n\nIn this example, the `read()` method returns an integer value representing the byte read from the input stream. Since the Version field is a single byte, you can assign the result directly to an `int` variable.\n\nIf you want to convert the byte value to hexadecimal representation, you can use the `Integer.toHexString()` method:\n\n```java\nString versionHex = Integer.toHexString(version);\n```\n\nThis will give you the hexadecimal representation of the Version field.\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nTo read the Version field from the input stream, you can use the `read()` method of the `InputStream` class.

Im familiar with basic TCP sockets but want to know how to translate requirements into code.Example: Format for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Common Log Format (CLF)Would like to see how to translate: 0          7 8        15 16       23 24         31  +-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+  |  Version  |           Record Length           | 0 - 3  +-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+   Version (1 byte):  0x41 for this document; hexadecimal encoded.
