It first gets the PrintWriter object from the response using `response.getWriter()`. Then, it wraps the response using a `CharResponseWrapper` to capture the response content. The `chain.doFilter()` method is called to continue the filter chain.\n\nAfter that, the captured response content is checked to see if it is of type \"text/html\" and not blank. If it meets the conditions, a `CharArrayWriter` is created to modify the response content. The code snippet appends the desired HTML chunk just before the closing `</body>` tag. The modified content is then written to the PrintWriter using `out.write()`.\n\nIf the captured response content does not meet the conditions, the original response content is written to the PrintWriter.\n\nFinally, the PrintWriter is closed using `out.close()`."

My goal is to append a chunk of HTML just before the closing </body> of all HTML responses.I'm working on a solution that extends the HttpServletResponseWrapper to use my own PrintWriter, then overriding the write methods thereon. Inside the write method I'm storing the last 7 characters to see if it's equal to the closing body tag, and then I write my HTML chunk plus the closing body tag, before continuing normal write operations for the rest of the document.I feel that somebody must have solved this problem already, and probably more elegantly than I will. I'd appreciate any examples of how to use a servlet filter to insert content into a response.UPDATEDResponding to a comment, I am also trying to implement the CharResponseWrapper from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/filters-137243.html. Here is my code:PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();CharResponseWrapper wrappedResponse = new CharResponseWrapper(        (HttpServletResponse)response);chain.doFilter(wrappedRequest, wrappedResponse);String s = wrappedResponse.toString();if (wrappedResponse.getContentType().equals(\"text/html\") &&        StringUtils.isNotBlank(s)) {    CharArrayWriter caw = new CharArrayWriter();    caw.write(s.substring(0, s.indexOf(\"</body>\") - 1));    caw.write(\"WTF</body></html>\");    response.setContentLength(caw.toString().length());    out.write(caw.toString());}else {    out.write(wrappedResponse.toString());}out.close();I am also wrapping the request, but that code works and shouldn't affect the response.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
