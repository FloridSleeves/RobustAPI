You can either provide the file name directly or get it dynamically from user input or any other source.\n\nThen, we create a `File` object using the `fileName` and pass it to the `RandomAccessFile` constructor along with the mode \"r\" to open the file in read mode.\n\nNext, we declare a byte array `a` to hold the data read from the file. In this example, we assume you want to read 10 bytes, but you can change the size of the array according to your requirements.\n\nWe then call the `read()` method on the `RandomAccessFile` object, passing the byte array `a` as the parameter. This will read the specified number of bytes from the file into the array.\n\nFinally, we close the `RandomAccessFile` object to release any system resources associated with it.\n\nNote: Make sure to handle any exceptions that may occur during file operations."

The code is as followsRandomAccessFile in = new RandomAccessFile('BOT.GRD', \"r\");in.read(a);Now I want to choose file dynamically rather than providing directly as above. I tried a lot and I was unable to do that. Can any one help me on this?\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:"
