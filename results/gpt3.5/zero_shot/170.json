However, in your case, you need to execute the command using the `/bin/bash -c` prefix to ensure that the command is executed in the terminal. \n\nThe `InputStream.read()` method is used to read the output of the command executed in the terminal. In the provided code, we create a `BufferedReader` to read the output from the `InputStream` of the process. We then use a `while` loop to read each character from the `InputStream` and print it to the console.\n\nNote that you need to replace `/Users/xxxx/Desktop/NewFolder/keytool` with the actual path to the `keytool` executable on your system."

I am really stuck up to access terminal window of mac through java code programmatically. It would be really useful if you provide your valuable solutions to perform my task which i have been struggling to do for a past two days. I am also posting the piece of code that I am trying to do for your reference. Any kind of help would be helpful for mepublic class TerminalScript{    public static void main(String args[]){        try {            Process proc = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(\"/Users/xxxx/Desktop/NewFolder/keytool -genkey -v -keystore test.keystore -alias test -keyalg RSA -sigalg SHA1withRSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000\");             BufferedReader read = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(                    proc.getInputStream()));            try {                proc.waitFor();            } catch (InterruptedException e) {                System.out.println(e.getMessage());            }            while (read.ready()) {                System.out.println(read.readLine());            }        } catch (IOException e) {            System.out.println(e.getMessage());        }    }}Note: I have to run the command keytool -genkey -v -keystore test.keystore -alias test -keyalg RSA -sigalg SHA1withRSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 in terminal through java program.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
