First, obtain the keySet() from the HashMap, then pass it to the Collections.enumeration() method to get an Enumeration.\n\nHere's an example code snippet:\n\nHashMap<String, Integer> hashMap = new HashMap<>();\n// Add some key-value pairs to the HashMap\n\nSet<String> keySet = hashMap.keySet();\nEnumeration<String> enumeration = Collections.enumeration(keySet);\n\nwhile (enumeration.hasMoreElements()) {\n    String key = enumeration.nextElement();\n    // Do something with the key\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The code snippet demonstrates how to obtain an Enumeration from the keys of a HashMap. First, we get the keySet() from the HashMap, which returns a Set of all the keys. Then, we pass this keySet to the Collections.enumeration() method, which returns an Enumeration. We can then iterate over the Enumeration using the hasMoreElements() and nextElement() methods to access each key in the HashMap."

I can only get a keySet(). From that Set, I can get an Iterator but an Iterator seems to be something different than an Enumeration. What is the best and most performant way to directly get an Enumeration from the Keys of a HashMap?Background: I am implementing my own ResourceBundle (=>getKeys() Method), and I have to provide/implement a method that returns the Enumeration of all Keys. But my implementation is based on a HashMap so I need to somehow figure out how to best convert betweens these two \"Iterator/Enumerator\" techniques.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
