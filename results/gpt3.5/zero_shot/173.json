However, the `while` loop condition is checking for `t` to be `null`, which means the loop will not exit when the end of the stream is reached. To fix this, you can modify the `while` loop condition to check the return value of `readLine()` against -1, which indicates the end of the stream has been reached. Additionally, you should catch `IOException` in case any other I/O error occurs. Finally, you can move the code in the `finally` block to ensure it is always executed, regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not."

No obvious errors (I think): :This is my main class - Main.java. Used to control requester but added for completeness.import java.io.IOException;import HtmlRequester.Requester;public class Main {public static void main(String[] args) {    Requester rq = new Requester(\"www.google.co.za\", 80);    try {        rq.htmlRequest();    } catch (IOException e) {        e.printStackTrace();        System.err.println(\"Connection failed.\");        System.exit(-1);    }}}This is requester.java, edited for shortness.package HtmlRequester;import java.net.*;import java.io.*;public class Requester{    Socket httpSocket = null;    PrintWriter out = null;    BufferedReader in = null;    String server;    int port;public void setAttributes(String server, int port){    this.server = server;    this.port = port;}public String htmlRequest(String server, int port) throws IOException{    try {        httpSocket = new Socket(InetAddress.getByName(server), port);        out = new PrintWriter(httpSocket.getOutputStream(), true);        in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(                httpSocket.getInputStream()));    } catch (UnknownHostException e) {        System.err.println(\"Don't know about host: \" + server);        System.exit(-1);    } catch (IOException e) {        System.err.println(\"Couldn't get I/O for \"                           + \"the connection to: \" + server + \"on port \" + port);        System.exit(-1);    }    finally{        System.out.println(\"Successful connection.\");    }    out.println(compileRequestText());    out.println(\"\");    String t;    String ret = \"\";    System.out.println(\"wait...\");    try {        while((t = in.readLine()) != null)        {        ret.concat(t);        System.out.println(t);        }        System.out.println(\"done\");    }    catch(SocketException e)    {        System.err.println(\"Socket Exception :(\");    }    System.out.println(\"Succesful data transfer.\");    out.close();    in.close();    httpSocket.close();    return ret;}private String compileRequestText(){    String ret = \"GET / HTTP/1.1\";    return ret;}}What happens is that the second try-catch block in Request.java, the block that contains:while((t = in.readLine()) != null)Will execute, and the response from server is successfully displayed. However, after the response is displayed, the loop will stop executing, the code does not move ahead to the finally block. The program does not seem to continue after that while loop. Anyone have any idea why?i.e.,             System.out.println(\"done\");is never reached, with no exceptions or compiler errors being thrown.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
