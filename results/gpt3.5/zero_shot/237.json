Then, create a byte array to store the mp3 data and set the buffer size (in this example, 4096 bytes). \n\nNext, use a while loop to read from the input stream using bis.read(buffer) and write the data to the output stream using fos.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead). The bytesRead variable stores the number of bytes read from the input stream. \n\nContinue reading and writing until the end of the file is reached (when bis.read(buffer) returns -1). \n\nFinally, close the streams to release system resources and call player.play() to play the mp3 file."
