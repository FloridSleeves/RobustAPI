This can lead to skipping elements or removing the wrong elements.\nOn the other hand, when you use an iterator loop and try to remove elements using `arr.remove(myString)`, it throws a `ConcurrentModificationException` because the iterator keeps track of the modifications made to the list and detects that the list has been modified outside of the iterator.\nTo avoid the `ConcurrentModificationException`, you should use the `iterator.remove()` method to remove elements from the list while iterating over it. This ensures that the iterator is aware of the modifications and can handle them correctly."

Thanks. \nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
