Since the ArrayList contains HashMaps, you can access the first HashMap using the get(0) method. Then, you can use Integer.parseInt() to convert the value to an integer. Finally, you can use Integer.compare() to compare the two numbers and return the result. This will sort the ArrayList based on the \"number\" key in ascending order."
