The base case is when the iterator has no more elements, in which case the function returns 0. Otherwise, it retrieves the next element using iterator.next() and adds it to the recursive call to summation with the updated iterator. This approach eliminates the need for an index variable. To use this solution, you would need to pass an Iterator<Integer> instead of an array and an index."

Thanks.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
