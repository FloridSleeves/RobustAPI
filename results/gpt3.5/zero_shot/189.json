The read() method returns -1 when the end of the file is reached. By using this method, you can accurately count the number of characters in the file.\n\nFor counting words, you can iterate through each character and check if it is a letter or digit using the Character.isLetterOrDigit() method. If it is, you can increment the word count. You also need to keep track of whether a word has started or not to avoid counting consecutive non-letter/digit characters as separate words.\n\nFor counting lines, you can simply check if the character read is equal to '\\n' (newline character) and increment the line count accordingly.\n\nMake sure to handle the IOException that can be thrown by the read() method.\n\nIn the main method, create an instance of the DocStats class with the file name as the argument. Then, call the getChar(), getWords(), and getLines() methods to get the respective counts and print them."

The reason is because I do not have '\\n' at the end of the last sentence but my method adds  numChars += line.length() + 1;However, I cannot find a solution to why I get 0 for words and lines.*My texts includes elements as: ? , - 'After all, could anyone help me to make this work? **So far, I the problem that concerns me is how I can get a number of characters, if the last sentence does not have '\\n' element. Is there a chance I could fix that with an if statement? -Thank you!\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
