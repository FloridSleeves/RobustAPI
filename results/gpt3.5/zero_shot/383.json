First, create an iterator object by calling the iterator() method on your linked list. Then, use the next() method on the iterator to retrieve the current item. This will move the iterator to the next item in the list. You can store the current item in a variable, such as \"currentItem\", and use it in other parts of your program. Note that the iterator will automatically move to the next item each time you call next()."

How to refer to the current item?: :I have a class which holds a linked list of Item objects. I want this class to hold the \"current\" Item somehow so I can refer to it in other parts of the program. Is the best way to do this to create a Item object within my class and set it equal to the \"current\" Item when I wish to set it?as such:for(int i = 0; i < [LinkedListofItems].length(); i++)    {Item currentItem = [LinkedListofItems].getAt(i); break;}And then if I would like to set and Items attributes equal to anothers I would override the = operator?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
