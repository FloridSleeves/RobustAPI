While both implementations use the same algorithm, there may be slight differences in the way the algorithm is implemented, resulting in different outputs.\n\nAdditionally, the encoding used to convert the string into bytes may also affect the output. In the Java code, the string is converted to bytes using \"UTF-8\" encoding, while in the C# code, the string is converted using the default encoding (UTF8Encoding). This difference in encoding may also contribute to the difference in the output.\n\nTo ensure consistent results, you should use the same encoding and algorithm implementation in both Java and C# code."
