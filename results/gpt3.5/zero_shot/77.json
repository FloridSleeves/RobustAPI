Create a DataOutputStream object to write data to the file.\n2. Iterate over your byte arrays and write each array to the file using the write() method.\n3. Use a separator (e.g., a specific byte value or a combination of bytes) to separate the arrays in the file.\n\nHere's an example code snippet:\n\n```java\nimport java.io.DataOutputStream;\nimport java.io.FileOutputStream;\nimport java.io.IOException;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        byte[] array1 = {1, 2, 3};\n        byte[] array2 = {4, 5, 6};\n        byte[] array3 = {7, 8, 9};\n\n        try (DataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(\"output.txt\"))) {\n            dos.write(array1, 0, array1.length);\n            dos.write(separatorBytes()); // Write a separator between arrays\n            dos.write(array2, 0, array2.length);\n            dos.write(separatorBytes()); // Write a separator between arrays\n            dos.write(array3, 0, array3.length);\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n\n    private static byte[] separatorBytes() {\n        // Return the bytes representing your separator\n        return new byte[]{10, 13}; // Example: newline characters\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we create three byte arrays (array1, array2, and array3) and write them to the \"output.txt\" file using the DataOutputStream.write() method. We also write a separator (newline characters in this case) between each array to allow for later splitting.\n\nNote: Make sure to handle any exceptions that may occur during file operations."

I can't do it in one time so I can't put my arrays in a container. Also the size of my arrays is variable.Secondly, the file is very huge, so I have to split it, in order to read it array by array.How can I do that ? I tried to write line by line my byte arrays  but I haven't been able. How can I put a separator between my arrays and after split it over this separator ?EDIT : I tried this :ByteArrayOutputStream bos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();ObjectOutput out = new ObjectOutputStream(bos);out.writeObject(byteArray);But, I execute this code several times, so the ObjectOutputStream adds each time a new header which corrupt the file.I also try : out.write(byteArray);but I couldn't separate my arrays. So I tried to append a '\\n', which didn't work. After I was looking for library like FileUtils in order to write byte[] line by line but I didn't find.\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:"
