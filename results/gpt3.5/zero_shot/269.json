Inside the loop, you can retrieve the row as a Map and then use the Map.get() method to get the value of the specific column you want. Replace \"columnName\" with the actual column name you want to retrieve the value from."

So Im stuck :(Any suggestions? thanks a lot!\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
