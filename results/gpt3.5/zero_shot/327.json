This is a type mismatch because the compiler cannot guarantee that the generic type E returned by the iterator is the same as the generic type E of the variable next. To fix this error, you can either cast the result of it.next() to the appropriate type or declare the variable next as a generic type. Here's an example of how you can fix the error:\n\nIterator<E> it = this.iterator();\nE next = (E) it.next();\n\nor\n\nIterator<E> it = this.iterator();\nE next = it.next();"

Iterator it = this.iterator();E next = it.next();next() returns a generic type E and next is of type E. Why is it giving me the error?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
