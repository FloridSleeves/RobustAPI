                "content": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next()\n<<<code>>>: You can achieve this by using the Iterator interface in Java. Here's an example of how you can iterate over half of the tiles using an Iterator:\n\nIterator<Tile> iterator = tiles.iterator();\nint count = 0;\nint halfSize = tiles.size() / 2;\n\nwhile (iterator.hasNext() && count < halfSize) {\n    Tile tile = iterator.next();\n    tile.draw();\n    count++;\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The code above creates an Iterator object for the tiles list using the iterator() method. It then initializes a count variable to keep track of the number of iterations and calculates the halfSize by dividing the size of the tiles list by 2.\n\nThe while loop continues as long as there are more elements in the iterator and the count is less than halfSize. Inside the loop, the next() method is called to retrieve the next element from the iterator, and the draw() method is called on the tile object.\n\nBy incrementing the count variable after each iteration, the loop will break when it reaches half of the tiles list, effectively cutting the loop in half."

I'm using them to make every class of my objects to do \"drawing\", but it takes a lot of memory so I want to cut it in half, is there a way to do for each loop not for a full list?for(Tile tile: tiles){tile.draw();}I want to:for(Tile tile: (half of)tiles){    tile.draw();}is it possible or I just need to get lenght of tiles and when it reaches the number break the loop?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
