We create a PrintWriter object with a FileWriter pointing to the log file. Then, we define a log method that takes a level and a message as parameters. Inside the log method, we use the PrintWriter.write method to write the log message in the format \"[level] message\\n\". Finally, we close the PrintWriter in the finally block to ensure the file is properly closed."
