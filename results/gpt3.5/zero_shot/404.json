However, you can create your own custom iterator interface that suits your needs.\n<<<explanation>>>: The java.util.Iterator interface in Java provides a way to iterate over a collection and access its elements one by one using the `next()` method. However, it does not provide a way to move the iterator without returning an element. If you need such functionality, you will have to create your own custom iterator interface or use a third-party library that provides this feature."

I want something more like C++ iterators, where I can move the pointer around without returning an element.  Is there something in the standard library like this, or has some de facto standard interface evolved through custom?  (If not, please don't waste your time posting code snippets - I'm quite able to think up reasonable names which will do the job).  \nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
