This way, you don't need to wait for a specific amount of time before decoding the stream. Once all the data is read, you can convert the ByteArrayOutputStream to a byte array and then use BitmapFactory.decodeByteArray to decode the image data into a Bitmap."

This portion needs to get images from flickr and load them into a texture.  The code I have below is functional most of the time, but it has a Thread.sleep() kludge in between getting the input stream from the connection and the bitmap factory decoding the stream:            URL url = new URL(\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4132/5168797476_7a85deb2be_b.jpg\");            URLConnection con = url.openConnection();            InputStream is = con.getInputStream();            Thread.sleep(250); //What am I actually waiting for?            sourceBitmap = BitmapFactory.decodeStream(is);How do I get around using the sleep() method in favor of something that makes logical sense?I am testing on a samsung galaxy tab not in the emulator\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
