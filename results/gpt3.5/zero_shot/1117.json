The `nextToken()` method is used to extract the next token from the input line. \n\nHere's how the code works:\n1. It initializes an array `studentID` to store the student IDs and an array `studentAnswers` to store the student answers.\n2. It reads the first line from the text file using `reader.readLine()` and assigns it to the variable `line`.\n3. It creates a new `StringTokenizer` object `strTkn` with the input line.\n4. It extracts the first token from the input line using `strTkn.nextToken()` and assigns it to the variable `answerKey`.\n5. It enters a loop to process each line of the text file.\n6. Inside the loop, it parses the next token as an integer using `Integer.parseInt(strTkn.nextToken())` and assigns it to the corresponding index of the `studentID` array.\n7. It extracts the next token using `strTkn.nextToken()` and assigns it to the corresponding index of the `studentAnswers` array.\n8. It increments the `total` variable to keep track of the number of students processed.\n9. It repeats steps 6-8 until there are no more lines in the text file.\n10. Finally, it returns the `studentAnswers` array.\n\nNote: The code assumes that the text file contains exactly 50 lines. If the number of lines is variable, you may need to adjust the size of the `studentID` and `studentAnswers` arrays accordingly."

You may have recently seen a post by me looking for help, but I did it wrong before, so I am going to start fresh and begin at the basics.I am trying to read a text file that looks like this:FTFFFTTFFTFT  3054 FTFFFTTFFTFT  4674 FTFTFFTTTFTF  ... etcWhat I need to do is put the first line into a String as the answer key.Next, I need to create an array with the student ID (the first numbers).Then, I need to create an array that is parallel to the student ID that contains the student's answers.Below is my code, and I can't quite figure out how to get it to work like this, and I was wondering if someone could help me out with it.public static String[] getData() throws IOException {      int[] studentID = new int[50];      String[] studentAnswers = new String[50];      int total = 0;      String line = reader.readLine();      strTkn = new StringTokenizer(line);      String answerKey = strTkn.nextToken();      while(line != null) {        studentID[total] = Integer.parseInt(strTkn.nextToken());        studentAnswers[total] = strTkn.nextToken();        total++;      }    return studentAnswers;    }So at the end of the day, the array structure should look like:studentID[0] = 3054studentID[1] = 4674... etcstudentAnswers[0] = FTFFFTTFFTFTstudentAnswers[1] = FTFTFFTTTFTFThanks :)\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
