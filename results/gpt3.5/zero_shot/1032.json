The nextToken() method of StringTokenizer returns the next token in the string. \n\nTo return the third token, you can iterate through the tokens using a for loop and keep track of the current token. If there are less than 3 tokens, you can handle that case by returning null or any other appropriate value.\n\nThe thirdToken() method takes a string input as a parameter and returns the third token as a string."

These are the instructions:Write a class called SpecialToken that has a static method called thirdToken. Thismethod should return as a String, the third token of a String that you pass as a parameter. You may assume that spaces will serve as delimiters.This is what I have so far but honestly I am stumped at what the parameter should be and how to return the third token! I was thinking I could do something like nextToken() until the third.public class SpecialToken {    public static String thirdToken() {    }}\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
