In your case, you are using a `BufferedReader` to read the input stream line by line. The `readLine` method of `BufferedReader` reads a line of text. \n\nThe issue you are facing with the buffered reader hanging while using POST requests might be due to the fact that the `readLine` method waits for a newline character or the end of the stream to be reached. If the POST request does not include a newline character, the `readLine` method will keep waiting.\n\nTo fix this issue, you can try using the `read` method of `InputStream` instead of `readLine` in order to read the input stream byte by byte. You can then process the received data accordingly.\n\nHere's an example of how you can modify your code to read the input stream byte by byte:\n\n```\nInputStream inputStream = socket.getInputStream();\nint data;\nwhile ((data = inputStream.read()) != -1) {\n    // process the byte of data\n}\n```\n\nBy using the `read` method, you can read the input stream byte by byte without waiting for a newline character. You can then process the received data as needed for your POST request handling."

It currently handles GET requests fine. However, whilst using POST the buffered reader seems to hang. When the request is stopped the rest of the input stream is read via the buffered reader. I have found a few things on google. I have tried changing the CRLF and the protocol version from 1.1 to 1.0 (browsers automatically make requests as 1.1) Any ideas or help would be appreciated. Thanks\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
