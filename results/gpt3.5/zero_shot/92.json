On the server side, you need to convert the response string to bytes using the desired encoding (in this case, UTF-8), write the length of the byte array to the output stream using writeInt, and then write the byte array itself using write. Finally, flush the output stream to ensure all data is sent.\n\nOn the client side, you can use the DataInputStream.readFully method to read the length of the response from the input stream, create a byte array of that length, and then read the entire response into the byte array using readFully. Finally, convert the byte array back to a string using the desired encoding and proceed with parsing the JSON as before."
