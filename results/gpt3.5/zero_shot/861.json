The readFully method reads bytes from the file until the byte array is filled or an end-of-file condition is encountered. \n\nIn the code snippet you provided, the byte array b1 is created with a size of 15. The readFully method reads 15 bytes from the file and stores them in b1. Then, a new String is created using the byte array b1, starting from index 0. The trim method is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the string.\n\nThe same process is repeated for the byte array b2 and the lastName variable.\n\nThe reason why the code doesn't give the same value for firstName and lastName is because they are read from different parts of the file. The readFully method reads bytes from the file starting from the current file pointer position. After reading the bytes for firstName, the file pointer moves forward by the number of bytes read, so when the readFully method is called again for lastName, it starts reading from the new file pointer position.\n\nThe code assumes that the length of each value (firstName, lastName) is fixed and known in advance (15 bytes in this case). If the length of the values in the file is different, the code may not work correctly."
