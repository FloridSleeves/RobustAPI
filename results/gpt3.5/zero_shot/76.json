The code is using `output.writeInt(msg.length+Integer.valueOf(0x00))` to write the length of the message, but it should be using `output.writeInt(msgBytes.length + 1)` instead. This is because `msgBytes.length` represents the length of the byte array, and we need to add 1 to account for the additional byte that is being written after the length.\n\nAdditionally, the code is using `output.write(msg)` to write the message to the output stream. However, `msg` is a string and `output.write` expects a byte array. To fix this, we can convert the string to a byte array using `msg.getBytes(Charset.forName(\"UTF-16\"))` and then write the byte array to the output stream using `output.write(msgBytes)`.\n\nBy making these changes, the code should be able to correctly send the handshake packet to the Minecraft server."

I have never really worked with networking too much, so the issue is figuring out how to send packets correctly. I am currently at the position of creating the handshake with the server. After hours of research, I have come up with the following code, but it always runs into the \"Failed! (Exception)\" message. To me, everything looks correct, but for all I know it could be 100% wrong. If someone could point out what I'm doing wrong here, I'd really appreciate it.For reference, feel free to use this and this.public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {    host = new InetSocketAddress(\"162.244.165.111\", 48040);    socket = new Socket();    System.out.println(\"Connecting...\");    socket.connect(host, 3000);    System.out.println(\"Done!\");    System.out.println(\"Making streams...\");    output = new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());    input = new DataInputStream(socket.getInputStream());    System.out.println(\"Done!\");    System.out.println(\"Attempting handshake... \"+host.getAddress().toString().substring(1));    byte[] msg = (\"47;\"+host.getAddress().toString().substring(1)+\";\"+host.getPort()+\";2;\").getBytes(Charset.forName(\"UTF-16\"));    output.writeInt(msg.length+Integer.valueOf(0x00));    output.writeByte(0x00);    output.write(msg);    output.flush();    try {        if (input.readByte() != 0x02)            System.out.println(\"Failed!\");        else            System.out.println(\"Done!\");    } catch (EOFException e) {        System.out.println(\"Failed! (Exception)\");    }}EDIT:More research suggests I use a Byte array, but this confuses me on how to represent a string and using strings is required?\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:"
