Instead of directly passing the filename to the PrintWriter constructor, we need to pass a FileWriter object that represents the file we want to write to. This can be done by creating a new FileWriter object with the filename as its parameter and passing it to the PrintWriter constructor. Additionally, we need to use the PrintWriter.write method to write the string to the file. After writing the string, we should flush the writer to ensure that all the data is written to the file and then close the writer. If any exception occurs during the file operation, we should handle it appropriately. In the given code, an IOException is caught and the appropriate message is displayed in the msg TextView."
