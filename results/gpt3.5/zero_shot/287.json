This is why the program goes into an infinite loop and only prints the first member of the sequence.\n\nTo fix this issue, you need to update the next() method to move the iterator to the next element if it exists. This can be done by checking if the iterator has a next element using the hasNext() method before calling the next() method to move the iterator.\n\nThe updated code above shows how to fix the issue by checking if the iterator has a next element in the next() method before moving the iterator to the next element."

I should use iterator() in its methods. private class SequenceSelector implements Selector {    private T obj = items.iterator().next();    public boolean end() { return !items.iterator().hasNext(); }    public T current() { return obj; }    public void next() { obj = items.iterator().next(); }}items is a ArrayList. obj is a value in order to save the first sequence member before the first next() using.With a following code the program goes into an infinite loop in which is printed only the first member of sequence. while(!selector.end()) {      System.out.print(selector.current() + \" \");      selector.next();}Why does this happens? Though I use next() method, the iterator doesn't move.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
