It reads the contents of the files using InputStreams and compares them byte by byte.\n\nIf multiple threads invoke the FileUtils.contentEquals() method in parallel, there can be race conditions and the end result of each execution may not be guaranteed. This is because the method reads the files using InputStreams, which can be shared among threads. If multiple threads try to read from the same InputStream concurrently, it can lead to unpredictable behavior and race conditions.\n\nTo ensure thread safety and avoid race conditions, you can synchronize the access to the InputStreams or use separate InputStreams for each thread. This way, each thread will have its own InputStream and there won't be any conflicts or race conditions.\n\nAlternatively, you can use other thread-safe methods or constructs provided by the Apache Commons IO library, such as the FileUtils.contentEqualsIgnoreEOL() method, which compares the contents of two files while ignoring end-of-line differences."
