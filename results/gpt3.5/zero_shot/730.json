To fix this, you can create the PrintWriter object outside the loop and close it after the loop is finished. Additionally, you can use the PrintWriter.write method to write the data to the file instead of the println method. The \"\\n\" at the end of the write statement is used to add a new line after each entry in the file. Finally, make sure to close the PrintWriter object after you are done writing to the file."

Any ideas?  I do need to overwrite the file as I don't want the original data preserved.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
