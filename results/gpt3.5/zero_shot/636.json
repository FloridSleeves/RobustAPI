We iterate through the array and for each number, we update its count in the map. If the number is not present in the map, we initialize its count to 1. If the number is already present, we increment its count by 1.\n\nAfter counting the occurrences of each number, we iterate through the values of the map. For each count, we divide it by 2 and add the result to the final count of unique pairs.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array. It only requires a single pass through the array to count the occurrences of each number and another pass through the map to calculate the number of unique pairs."

May be not so good if n is quite big I guess...Well, 2 questions:am I understanding good how to \"measure\" the efficiency of the code?there's a better way to count the number of unique pairs in a given array?EDIT:Damn I've just posted and I'm already swamped by answers! Thanks! I'll study each one with care, for the time being I say I don't get those involving HashMap: out of my knowledge yet (hence thanks again for the insight:o) )\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:"
