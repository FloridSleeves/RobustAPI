Then, you can sort the list in descending order based on the scores using a custom comparator. Finally, you can iterate over the sorted list using an iterator and remove the entries with the lowest scores until you reach half of the total number of players.\n\nHere's an example code snippet:\n\n```java\npublic static void removeLowestScores(Map<String, Integer> map) {\n    List<Map.Entry<String, Integer>> entries = new ArrayList<>(map.entrySet());\n\n    // Sort the list in descending order based on scores\n    Collections.sort(entries, (e1, e2) -> e2.getValue().compareTo(e1.getValue()));\n\n    // Calculate the number of entries to remove\n    int numToRemove = entries.size() / 2;\n\n    // Iterate over the sorted list and remove the entries with the lowest scores\n    Iterator<Map.Entry<String, Integer>> iterator = entries.iterator();\n    while (iterator.hasNext() && numToRemove > 0) {\n        iterator.next();\n        iterator.remove();\n        numToRemove--;\n    }\n\n    // Update the map with the remaining entries\n    map.clear();\n    for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : entries) {\n        map.put(entry.getKey(), entry.getValue());\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou can call this method after the first round of your game finishes to remove the lowest scores from the map."

For instance, There could be 8 players in the map 4 of whom have a score of 10 and the other 4 have a score of 0 how would i split the map in half based on the top scorers and remove the bottom 4? Keep in mind the 8 players is not defined, it could be any number\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
