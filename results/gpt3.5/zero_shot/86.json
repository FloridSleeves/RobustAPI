Then, we write the sequence number to the DataOutputStream using the writeShort method. After that, we write the actual image data to the output stream using the write method. Finally, we flush the output stream to ensure all data is sent.\n\nNote that you need to replace \"socket\" with your actual DatagramSocket object, and \"imageData\" with the byte array containing the image file data.\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nThis code snippet demonstrates how to include a 16-bit message sequence number in the header of the data messages using the DataOutputStream.write method. The sequence number is generated randomly and written to the output stream before writing the actual data. This allows the receiver to filter out duplicate messages based on the sequence number."
