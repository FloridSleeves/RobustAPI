However, there are a few issues with your code.\n\nFirst, when creating the StringTokenizer object, you should pass the entire string as the first argument, not just the next token. So it should be `new StringTokenizer(str, \"|\")`.\n\nSecond, you need to initialize the variable `i` to 0 before the while loop.\n\nThird, you need to use the `strString` object to call the `nextToken()` method, not `Loginstring`.\n\nFinally, you need to make sure to increment the value of `i` inside the loop, otherwise it will always be 0 and the first condition will always be true, causing the loop to exit after the first iteration.\n\nI have corrected these issues in the code provided above. Now, the code should correctly split the string and assign the values to the variables `str1`, `str2`, and `str3` based on the index."

Closed 10 years ago.I have a string as str=123|apple|apple|apple|dog$i like to seperate string using \"|\" character.    String str = \"123|apple|apple|apple|dog$\";    StringTokenizer strString = new StringTokenizer(str..nextToken(), \"|\");    int i;    while (strString.hasMoreElements()) {        if (i == 0)            str1 = Loginstring.nextToken();        else if (i == 1)            str2 = Integer.Loginstring.nextToken();        else if (i == 2) {            str3 = Loginstring.nextToken();            break;        }        i = i + 1;    }but it exit on first loop onwards(that means it exit from loop if i more than 1),, really i dont know y its happens, whats wrong with it\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
