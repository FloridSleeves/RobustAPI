We then obtain the InputStream of the process using process.getInputStream(). We create a BufferedReader to read the output from the InputStream. We read each line from the BufferedReader and print it to stdout using System.out.println(). This allows us to see the output of the process as it is generated. Finally, we call process.waitFor() to wait for the process to complete."

Either a Java or Groovy code example would be fine.foo.bat can take several minutes to run and generates a lot of output, so I would like to see the output as soon as it is generated, rather than having to wait until the process has completed before seeing all the output at once.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
