It reads up to the specified number of bytes from the input stream into a byte array and returns the number of bytes actually read. In the given code snippet, we are using a buffer of size 1024 bytes and continuously reading data from the input stream until the end of the stream is reached (-1 is returned). The read data can then be processed as needed."

The Content-Type should remain application/json because that describes the actual data. Accept-Encoding and Transfer-Encoding seem to be for telling the server how it should format the response. It appears that responses use the Content-Encoding header explicitly for this purpose, but it is not a valid request header.Is there something I am missing? Has anyone found an elegant solution?Specific Use-CaseMy use-case is that I have a mobile app that is generating large amounts of JSON (and some binary data in some cases but to a lesser extent) and compressing the requests saves a large amount of bandwidth. I am using Tomcat as my Servlet container. I am using Spring for its MVC annotations primarily just to abstract away some of the JEE stuff into a much cleaner, annotation-based interface. I also use Jackson for auto (de)serialization.I also use nginx, but I am not sure if thats where I want the decompression to take place. The nginx nodes simply balance the requests which are then distributed through the data center. It would be just as nice to keep it compressed until it actually got to the node that was going to process it.Thanks in advance,JohnEDIT:The discussion between myself and @DaSourcerer was really helpful for those that are curious about the state of things at the time of writing this.I ended up implementing a solution of my own. Note that this specifies the branch \"ohmage-3.0\", but it will soon be merged into the master branch. You might want to check there to see if I have made any updates/fixes.https://github.com/ohmage/server/blob/ohmage-3.0/src/org/ohmage/servlet/filter/DecompressionFilter.java\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
