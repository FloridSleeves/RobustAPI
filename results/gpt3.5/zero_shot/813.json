The Minecraft server expects commands to be terminated with a new line character. Additionally, you need to flush the output to ensure that the message is sent immediately. By using PrintWriter.write, you can write the message and add a new line character using PrintWriter.println."

A Minecraft server, to be precise. I have all the basics down (using ProcessBuilder, executing with arguments, waiting for an exit code, etc.), but there is one thing that I cannot figure out. Sending commands to the application. Here part of my CommandLineSender class:public class CommandLineSender extends Thread {    private BufferedWriter output;    private InputStream source;  // Set to System.in when creating the object    private boolean stopRequested;    public CommandLineSender(Process sendTo, InputStream source) {        this.output = new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(sendTo.getOutputStream()));        this.source = source;        System.out.println(\"Source InputStream initiated: \" + source.toString());        this.stopRequested = false;    }    @Override    public void run() {        System.out.println(\"Run called.\");        Scanner cmdScanner = new Scanner(source);        while (cmdScanner.hasNextLine() && !stopRequested) {            System.out.println(\"Has next line\");            String msg = cmdScanner.nextLine();            write(msg);            System.out.println(\"Wrote: \" + msg);        }        // Close the scanner and BufferedWriter        System.out.println(\"Closed.\");    }    // Other various methods    protected void write(String msg) {        try {            output.write(msg);        } catch (IOException e) {            System.err.println(\"Unable to write message because of an unhandled IOException: \" + e.getMessage());        }    }The output I get is this:(Default Minecraft server output)help  // My commandHas next lineWrote: helpThis may not matter, but I am executing my server with these arguments:java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar (path to server jar) noguiThank you for your time.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
