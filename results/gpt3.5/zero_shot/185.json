In the code snippet above, we create an `ANTLRInputStream` object using `System.in` as the input source. Then, we create a lexer and parser using the generated lexer and parser classes from your ANTLR grammar.\n\nTo parse the input, you need to call the appropriate rule in your parser. Replace `yourRule` with the actual rule in your grammar that represents the starting point of your language. The `ParseTree` object represents the parse tree generated by the parser.\n\nAfter processing the parse tree, if you want to continue parsing more input, you can reset the input stream, lexer, tokens, and parser to clear their state. This allows you to read and parse more input interactively.\n\nNote that this code assumes you have already generated the lexer and parser classes from your ANTLR grammar. Make sure to replace `YourLexer` and `YourParser` with the actual names of your lexer and parser classes."

The examples I've found on the web are all using a per line cycle, e.g.:while(readline)  result = parse(line)  doStuff(result)But what if I'm writing something like pascal/smtp/etc, with a \"first line\" looks like X requirment? I know it can be checked in doStuff, but I think logically it is part of the syntax.Or what if a command is split into multiple lines? I can trywhile(readline)  lines.add(line)  try    result = parse(lines)    lines = []    doStuff(result)  catch    nopBut with this I'm also hiding real errors.Or I could reparse all lines everytime, but:it will be slow there are instructions I don't want to run twiceCan this be done with ANTLR, or if not, with something else?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
