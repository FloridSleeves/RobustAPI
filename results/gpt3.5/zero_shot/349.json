NOTE : At first i tried using ImageIcon to add to JPanel but it could not work hence i found this solution which lead to my current problem. I just starting programming in Java.EDIT: Here are the link to the images and I am doing a Java ApplicationI need an alternative to add a image to a JPanel. \nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
