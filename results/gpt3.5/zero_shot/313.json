This new iterator will keep track of whether the first element has been returned or not. If it hasn't, it will return the first element when next() is called. If it has, it will delegate the call to the original iterator.\n\nIn the code above, the methodAcceptingIterator() method first retrieves the first element from the original iterator using it.next(). It then processes this first element. After that, it iterates over the remaining elements using it.hasNext() and it.next(), processing each element as needed.\n\nAfter the iteration is complete, a new iterator is created using an anonymous inner class. This new iterator keeps track of whether the first element has been returned or not using a boolean flag isFirstElement. The hasNext() method of the new iterator returns true if isFirstElement is true or if the original iterator has more elements. The next() method of the new iterator returns the first element if isFirstElement is true, and delegates the call to the original iterator otherwise.\n\nFinally, the modified iterator is passed to anotherMethod() for further processing."

The only way to know that the flagged elements are over, is by noticing that the (k+1)th element is not flagged. The problem is that if I do that, the iterator it will not provide me the first value anymore on the next call to next().I want to pass this iterator to a method as it's only argument and I would like to avoid changing its signarture and it implementation. I know I could do this:    public void methodAcceptingIterator(Iterator<String> it) //current signature   //change it to   public void methodAcceptingIterator(String firstElement, Iterator<String> it)But this looks like a workarround/hack decreasing the elegance and generality of the code, so I don't want to this. Any ideas how I could solve this problem ?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
