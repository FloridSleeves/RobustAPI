In this code, we use a byte array buffer to read the stream in chunks of 1024 bytes. We also keep track of the current search index and the length of the search string.\n\nInside the while loop, we iterate over the bytes read from the stream and compare each byte with the corresponding character in the search string. If there is a match, we increment the search index. If the search index reaches the length of the search string, it means we have found the search string in the stream and we return true.\n\nIf there is no match, we reset the search index to 0 and continue searching in the next chunk of the stream. This ensures that we correctly handle cases where the search string spans across multiple chunks.\n\nIf the end of the stream is reached (numBytesRead = -1), it means we have searched the entire stream without finding the search string, so we return false.\n\nThis approach minimizes the number of reads from the stream and keeps memory usage constant, as we only need to store a fixed-size buffer. The efficiency of the string matching algorithm used here is not the primary focus, but it provides a simple and effective solution for searching a stream for a string."

The stream of text might be very large so as soon as the search string is found I'd like to return true and also try to avoid storing the entire input in memory.Naively, I might try to do something like this (in Java):public boolean streamContainsString(Reader reader, String searchString) throws IOException {    char[] buffer = new char[1024];    int numCharsRead;    while((numCharsRead = reader.read(buffer)) > 0) {        if ((new String(buffer, 0, numCharsRead)).indexOf(searchString) >= 0)            return true;    }    return false;}Of course this fails to detect the given search string if it occurs on the boundary of the 1k buffer:Search text: \"stackoverflow\"Stream buffer 1: \"abc.........stack\"Stream buffer 2: \"overflow.......xyz\"How can I modify this code so that it correctly finds the given search string across the boundary of the buffer but without loading the entire stream into memory?Edit: Note when searching a stream for a string, we're trying to minimise the number of reads from the stream (to avoid latency in a network/disk) and to keep memory usage constant regardless of the amount of data in the stream. Actual efficiency of the string matching algorithm is secondary but obviously, it would be nice to find a solution that used one of the more efficient of those algorithms.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
