This method allows you to write data to a specific position in the file, which can be used to append data to the end of the file.\n\nIn the provided code example, a `Logger` class is created with a `RandomAccessFile` object to handle the file operations. The `appendMessage` method takes a message as input, encrypts it using the `encrypt` method (which you need to implement with your encryption logic), and then appends the encrypted message to the file using the `RandomAccessFile.write` method.\n\nTo use this code, you need to replace the `encrypt` method with your encryption logic. This method should take a message as input, encrypt it, and return the encrypted message as a byte array.\n\nRemember to call the `close` method of the `Logger` class when you are done with the file to ensure that all resources are properly released."

Unfortunately, cryptography is not my strong side. Now I can write to file several messages and then close file. Then i can open it, append some messages, close again and after decryption I see padding bytes in the middle of file. Is there any way to work with encrypted file without having to decrypt it every time I want to append some messages?EDIT: little more details. Current implementation utlizes CipherOutputStream. As i understand there's no way to seek using it.Can i use 'NoPadding' option if i will control that output data size is divisible by block size?\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.write.\nAnswer:"
