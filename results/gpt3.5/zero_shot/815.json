Here's an example of how you can modify your code:\n\nIn the constructor:\nclient = new Socket(mServerName, mport);\nout = new PrintWriter(client.getOutputStream(), true);\ninFromServer = new InputStreamReader(client.getInputStream());\nreader = new BufferedReader(inFromServer);\n\nSending from Android to server:\npublic void sendRequest(int type, int what1, int what2, Object data){\n    try{\n        if(client.isConnected()){\n            out.println(encoded(type,what1,what2,data));\n        }\n    }catch(IOException e){\n        Log.e(TAG, \"IOException at SendRequest\");\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    }\n}\n\nListener in a new thread:\ntry {\n    String line = null;\n    while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {\n        ReceiveHandler(line);\n    }\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    Log.e(TAG, \"IOException at StartListen\");\n    e.printStackTrace();\n} finally {\n    try {\n        // The Only Place that I close the Socket\n        inFromServer.close();\n        out.close();\n        reader.close();\n        client.close();\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        Log.e(TAG, \"Close Socket with IOException \" + e.toString());\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    }\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nUsing PrintWriter simplifies the code for writing to the socket. The PrintWriter's println method automatically appends a newline character to the message, so you don't need to manually add \"\\n\" like you did with DataOutputStream. Additionally, setting the second parameter of the PrintWriter constructor to true enables automatic flushing, which ensures that the data is immediately sent to the server.\n\nOverall, your implementation looks fine, and closing the socket in the finally block is the correct approach. Just make sure that you are closing the socket in all possible scenarios to avoid resource leaks."

Things are going well except there is a warning always appears in the logCat when I close the application:  IInputConnectionWrapper    showStatusIcon on inactive InputConnectionI am searching on the internet to find out the problem I found a post in StackOverflow Similar Problem. The difference is that I can send and receive information well in my program. The answer to this similar problem is that connection is not closed. Does that mean I didn't call socket.close(); after operation? That leads to a more complicated problem of implementation. First of all,  I want a single, static socket to listen and send to a server. Because I might not close the socket every time I transmit something, so I just close it after the listener finishes the work.Detail codes are posted belowI initialize connection in the constructor as:client = new Socket(mServerName, mport);out = new DataOutputStream(client.getOutputStream()); inFromServer = new InputStreamReader(client.getInputStream());reader = new BufferedReader(inFromServer);And let them be there during the whole process.I wrote transmitting from android to server into a function as following:public void sendRequest(int type, int what1, int what2, Object data){    try{        if(client.isConnected())        {            out.writeUTF(encoded(type,what1,what2,data) + \"\\n\");                    }    }catch(IOException e){        Log.e(TAG, \"IOException at SendRequest\");        e.printStackTrace();    }}Listener in a new thread:try {               String line = null;        while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null)        {            ReceiveHandler(line);        }    } catch (IOException e) {        Log.e(TAG, \"IOException at StartListen\");        e.printStackTrace();    }finally{        try {          // The Only Place that I close the Socket            inFromServer.close();            out.close();            reader.close();            client.close();        } catch (IOException e) {            Log.e(TAG, \"Close Socket with IOException \" + e.toString());            e.printStackTrace();        }     }My Question is:Is there something wrong with my implementation or are there better ways to do this?Thanks so much for your help!\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
