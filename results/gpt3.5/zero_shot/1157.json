To achieve the desired result, you can use the StringTokenizer class from the given API. It allows you to split a string based on a delimiter and retrieve the tokens individually. In the provided code, we create a StringTokenizer object with the input string and the delimiter \"\u00a7\". We then iterate over the tokens using a while loop and store them in the data array. Finally, we have the desired result with a 3-long String[] containing the values \"Look like this\", \"0\", and \"25\"."

This returns data split by \u00a7. In eclipse, when run as an application, the code works fine. The issue is when I bring it to Android. I have done some research on this but haven't been able to find a working solution. (Have tried Pattern.quote(\"\u00a7\")) Here is an example of what I'm running:String input = \"Look like this\u00a70\u00a725\";String[] data = input.split(\"\u00a7\");The expected data would be a 3-long String[] with the values \"Look like this\", \"0\", and \"25\". This is what happens in eclipse. In android, I get a 1-long String[] with the value \"Look like this\u00a70\u00a725\". Does anyone know if this is an issue with android or am I doing something wrong?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
