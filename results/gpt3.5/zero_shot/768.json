It opens a connection to the server, creates a PrintWriter to write data to the server, and then reads the image file and writes it to the server using a byte buffer. After writing the image data, it closes the streams and gets the response from the server. The response code is checked to determine if the image was uploaded successfully or if an error occurred."
