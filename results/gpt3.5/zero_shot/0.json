To fix this, you can pass the Activity as a parameter to the AlarmHelper constructor and use that activity reference to call findViewById(). This way, the AlarmHelper class will have access to the layout and be able to find the DatePicker view."

I believe it has something to do the the Context but I haven't got a clue how to implement it within my helper class.Any help would be greatly appreciated.\nPlease using this api: Activity.findViewById.\nAnswer:"
