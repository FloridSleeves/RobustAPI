Timer-task VS handler VS alarm-manager: :I'm trying to build an Android app which will repeatedly run some process every 10 mins.As I found out Handlers are more reliable than timers or scheduling. So I'm going to develop my app using the Handlers using the given below codes.I'm little bit concerned that the below codes will create separate Handlers at each time I start the app and keep them running parallel, may be since I'm creating the Handler on onCreate.So what is the best way to keep only a single Handler runs in background at a time? private Handler handler;@Overrideprotected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);    handler = new Handler(); // new handler    handler.postDelayed(runnable, 1000*60*10); // 10 mins int.    setContentView(R.layout.activity_pro__sms);} private Runnable runnable = new Runnable() {    @Override    public void run() {        /* my set of codes for repeated work */        foobar();        handler.postDelayed(this, 1000*60*10); // reschedule the handler    }};\nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer:"
