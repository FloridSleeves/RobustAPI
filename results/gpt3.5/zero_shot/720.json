The code reads the input XML file using a BufferedReader.\n2. It creates a temporary file to write the modified XML.\n3. It loops through each line of the input XML file.\n4. It uses the `replaceAll` method with a regular expression to replace \"Hello\" with \"HI\" in the line. The regular expression `(?<!\\\")Hello(?!\\\\\\\")` ensures that \"Hello\" is not part of a tag attribute by checking for the absence of double quotes before and after \"Hello\".\n5. It writes the modified line to the temporary file using PrintWriter's `write` method.\n6. After processing all the lines, it closes the reader and writer.\n7. It renames the temporary file to the original file to replace the original XML file.\n8. Finally, it prints a success message.\n\nNote: Make sure to replace \"input.xml\" with the actual path to your input XML file."
