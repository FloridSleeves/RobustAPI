It seems like you are trying to parameterize a non-generic Set with the type Integer, which is not allowed. To fix this error, you should use a generic Set implementation, such as HashSet<Integer> or TreeSet<Integer>, instead of a non-generic Set implementation.\n<<<explanation>>>: The error message \"The type Set is not generic; it cannot be parameterized with arguments <Integer>\" indicates that you are trying to use a generic type argument <Integer> with a non-generic Set implementation. In Java, generic types allow you to specify the type of elements that a collection can hold. However, not all types in Java are generic, and the Set interface is one of them.\n\nTo fix this error, you should use a generic Set implementation, such as HashSet<Integer> or TreeSet<Integer>, which can be parameterized with the type Integer. Here's an example of how you can use a generic Set implementation:\n\nSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();\nset.add(1);\nset.add(2);\nset.add(3);\n\nIterator<Integer> iterator = set.iterator();\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\n    Integer element = iterator.next();\n    System.out.println(element);\n}\n\nIn this example, we create a HashSet<Integer> and add some Integer elements to it. Then, we obtain an iterator from the set using the iterator() method. We can then use the Iterator.next() method to retrieve each element from the set and print it.\n\nMake sure to import the necessary classes, such as java.util.Set, java.util.HashSet, and java.util.Iterator, to use the generic Set implementation and the Iterator interface."
