Then, calculate the length of the remaining bytes in input stream A by subtracting the offset from the available bytes in the input stream. \n\nNext, create a byte array buffer with the calculated length. Use the `skip` method to skip the specified number of bytes from the input stream A. Finally, use the `read` method to read the remaining bytes into the buffer. \n\nTo create input stream B from the buffer, you can use the `ByteArrayInputStream` class. This class allows you to create an input stream from a byte array."
