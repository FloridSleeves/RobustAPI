Whenever a new node is added to the Doubly Linked List, add it to the ArrayList as well.\n4. Whenever a node is removed from the Doubly Linked List, remove it from the ArrayList as well.\n5. To access a certain node in O(1) time, use the List.get(index) method on the ArrayList, where index is the position of the node in the ArrayList.\n6. To move a node with ID 5 to the end of the list in O(1) time, find the index of the node with ID 5 in the ArrayList using List.indexOf(Object) method.\n7.

To move a node with a specific ID to the end of the list, you can find its index in the ArrayList using List.indexOf(Object) method, remove it from its current position in the Doubly Linked List and ArrayList using List.remove(index) method, and then add it to the end of the Doubly Linked List and ArrayList using List.add(Object) method. This way, you can achieve O(1) time complexity for accessing and moving nodes in the Doubly Linked List."

I know that if i traverse the list to find a certain node it would take O(n) time so I want to map the nodes to an array list where I can access the nodes in O(1) time.I'm really unsure how I would do this mapping. I would like to see an example of how this can be done.Edit:I would like to be able to access any node in the linked list so I can move the nodes around in O(1) time.Example: Move node with ID 5 to end of list in O(1) time. Edit 2: I uploaded a picture example of what I'm trying to accomplish\nPlease using this api: List.get.\nAnswer:"
