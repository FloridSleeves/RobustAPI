Get the PackageManager using `context.getPackageManager()`.\n2. Create an Intent with the ACTION_VIEW action and the file's URI.\n3. Use `packageManager.queryIntentActivities(intent, 0)` to get the list of ResolveInfo objects that match the Intent.\n4. Create an ArrayList to store the application icons.\n5. Iterate through the ResolveInfo objects and get the ApplicationInfo for each ResolveInfo.\n6. Use `applicationInfo.loadIcon(packageManager)` to load the icon for each application.\n7. Add the appIcon to the ArrayList.\n8. You can then use the appIcons ArrayList to display the icons in a ListView or any other way you prefer."

If the file were an image I would do something like this normally to show all applications capable of viewing the image.Intent intent = new Intent();intent.setAction(android.content.Intent.ACTION_VIEW);intent.setDataAndType(Uri.fromFile(file), \"image/*\");context.startActivity(intent);However say I have an unknown file how could I list all applications able to view a file so the user can select the appropriate application to open the file in my application.I also need the titles listed in an arraylist if possible so I can list them in a listview. Thank you for any help with getting a list of applications capable of viewing a file===================================EditAlright well something easier how can i get the applications from the above intent into an arraylist i could just do image/* audio/* etc and add them all to a list and then list them in a listview and that would solve my problem\nPlease using this api: ApplicationInfo.loadIcon.\nAnswer:"
