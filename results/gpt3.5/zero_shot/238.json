However, if you need to use the InputStream.read() method, you can convert it to work with BufferedReader.\n\nFirst, create a BufferedReader with the UTF8 encoding:\nBufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream(), \"UTF8\"));\n\nThen, create a char array buffer to store the read characters:\nchar[] buffer = new char[length];\n\nNext, use the InputStream.read() method to read the bytes into the buffer:\nint bytesRead = in.read(buffer, offset, length);\n\nFinally, convert the read characters to a UTF8 string:\nString result = new String(buffer, offset, bytesRead);\n\nYou can then assign the result to your desired variable, in this case, main.title."

The following method works fine:BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream(), \"UTF8\"));main.title = in.readLine();but then I need a int java.io.InputStream.read(byte[] b, int offset, int length) method which does not exist for a BufferedReader. So then I tried to take a DataInputStream DataInputStream in2 = new DataInputStream(socket.getInputStream());but everything it reads is just rubbish. Then I tried to use the readLine() method from DataInputStream but this doesn't give me the correct UTF8 string.You see my dilemma. Can't I use two readers for one InputStream? Or can I convert the DataInputStream.readLine() result and convert it to UTF8?Thanks,Martin\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
