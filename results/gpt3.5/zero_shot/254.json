It starts by skipping the specified number of bytes using the `InputStream.skip` method. Then, it reads from the input stream into a buffer and writes the buffer to the output stream until the specified length of bytes is reached or the end of the input stream is reached. The buffer size is set to 8192 bytes, but you can adjust it as needed."
