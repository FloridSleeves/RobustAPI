The Iterator interface provides a method called next() which returns the next element in the iteration. To use it, you first need to obtain an Iterator object by calling the iterator() method on the Set. Then, you can call the next() method on the Iterator to retrieve the next element. In the given code, we create an Iterator object called \"iterator\" by calling set.iterator(). Then, we retrieve the next element from the Iterator using iterator.next() and assign it to the variable \"item\". This allows you to retrieve data from a Set without having to cast it to an Array or use an index."

(other than using an iterator)I'm sure the fact that it's excluded from the API means there's a good reason for not doing this -- could someone please enlighten me?EDIT:Some extremely great answers here, and a few saying \"more context\".  The specific scenario was a dbUnit test, where I could reasonably assert that the returned set from a query had only 1 item, and I was trying to access that item.However, the question is more valid without the scenario, as it remains more focussed:What's the difference between set and list.Thanks to all for the fantastic answers below.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
