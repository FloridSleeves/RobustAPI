However, it is converting the entire stream into a String and back to a stream, which is not efficient.\n\nA more elegant solution would be to override the read() method of the InputStream directly, without converting the stream into a String. The overridden read() method can check for the '&' character and replace it with '&amp;' on the fly.\n\nIn the provided code, the read() method is overridden to handle the replacement of '&' character. It reads one character at a time from the underlying InputStream and checks if it is '&'. If it is, it reads the next characters to check if it matches the sequence 'amp;'. If it does, it returns '&', otherwise it returns the next character.\n\nThis approach avoids unnecessary conversions and provides a more efficient solution to the problem."

I unmarshal my input stream using the javax library, which rightfully throws exceptions if the InputStream includes the & character not followed by \"amp;\"The workaround I came up with was to create the following class:import java.io.ByteArrayInputStream;import java.io.FilterInputStream;import java.io.InputStream;/** * Provide an input stream where all & characters are properly encoded as &amp; */public class FormattedStream extends FilterInputStream {  public FormattedStream(InputStream src) {    super(new ByteArrayInputStream(StringUtil.toString(src)      .replace(\"&\", \"&amp;\").replace(\"amp;amp;\", \"amp;\").getBytes()));  }}Note: StringUtil is a simple utility I have to turn an input stream into a String.With that class in place, I now invoke the JAXB unmarshaller with:unmarshal(new FormattedStream(inputStream));instead ofunmarshal(inputStream);This approach works but does seem odd for a few reasons:1 - Because of the restriction that super must be the first element in the constructor (restriction which I fail to understand despite what I read about it), I am forced to do all my processing in one line, making the code far from readable.2 - Converting the entire stream into a String and back to a stream seems overkill3 - The code above is slightly incorrect in that a stream containing amp;amp; will be modified to containing amp;I could address 1 by providing a FormatInputStream class with one method:InputStream preProcess(InputStream inputStream)where I would do the same operations I am currently doing in the constructor of my FormattedStream class but it seems odd to have to choose a different interface because of a coding limitation.I could address 2 by keeping my FormattedStream constructor simple:super(src)and overriding the three read methods but that would involve much more coding: overriding the three read methods by replacing the & on the fly is not trivial compared to the one-line of code I currently have where I can leverage the replaceAll String method.As for 3, it seems enough of a corner case that I don't worry about it but maybe I should...Any suggestions on how to solve my issue in a more elegant way?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
