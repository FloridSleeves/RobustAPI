The RandomAccessFile class allows you to seek to a specific position in the file and write data at that position.\n\nIn the code provided, a Logger class is created with a RandomAccessFile object. The constructor takes the file name as a parameter and opens the file in \"rw\" mode, which allows both reading and writing.\n\nThe appendMessage method takes a message as a parameter. It seeks to the end of the file using the `file.seek(file.length())` method, which positions the file pointer at the end of the file. Then, it writes the message to the file using the `file.write(message.getBytes())` method.\n\nTo use this Logger class, you can create an instance of it and call the `appendMessage` method whenever you want to append a message to the encrypted file. Finally, remember to call the `close` method to close the file when you are done.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that the encrypted file is a binary file and not a text file. If the encrypted file is a text file, you may need to consider encoding and decoding the messages properly."

Unfortunately, cryptography is not my strong side. Now I can write to file several messages and then close file. Then i can open it, append some messages, close again and after decryption I see padding bytes in the middle of file. Is there any way to work with encrypted file without having to decrypt it every time I want to append some messages?EDIT: little more details. Current implementation utlizes CipherOutputStream. As i understand there's no way to seek using it.Can i use 'NoPadding' option if i will control that output data size is divisible by block size?\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.write.\nAnswer:"
