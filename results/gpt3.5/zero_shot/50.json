First, you need to get a list of all installed applications using the `getInstalledApplications()` method. This will return a list of `ApplicationInfo` objects.\n\nThen, you can iterate over the list and retrieve the package name of each application. With the package name, you can use the `getApplicationIcon()` method to get the icon of the application. You can then use the icon as needed in your application.\n\nNote that the `getApplicationIcon()` method returns a `Drawable` object, which represents the icon of the application. You can use this `Drawable` object to display the icon in an `ImageView` or any other UI element.\n\nPlease make sure to handle any necessary permissions in your AndroidManifest.xml file, such as the `android.permission.GET_TASKS` permission, to access information about other applications."

I am trying to find the value how many times were the already installed packages executed (closed and open).
