If I were to use a couple of Arrays I could have done it a while ago but having to use the StringTokenizer is driving me nuts. The main problem I am having is reading the CSV file. I don't know how to do it and previous searches online have only brought forward super intense solutions that are too much for a beginner like me to handle. This is my code. As you can see, I don't know whether use .nextLine() or .NextToken(). Neither seems to work.For those wondering the assignment is basically reading the first 4 products separated by commas and reading the rest of the rows as the rating of those 4 products. Basically 6 rows with 4 columns. The first row is the products the rest are the ratings.import java.util.StringTokenizer;import java.io.FileInputStream;import java.io.FileNotFoundException;import java.util.Scanner;public class ProductRating {public static void main(String[] args) {    // TODO Auto-generated method stub    Scanner fileIn=null;    try{        fileIn = new Scanner(                 new FileInputStream(\"C:/Users/Cristian/Desktop\"));    }    catch (FileNotFoundException e)     {  // This block executed if the file is not found        // and then the program exits    System.out.println(\"File not found.\");    System.exit(0);    }    //If Opened File Successful this runs    String products = \"A\";    String rantings =\"0\";    System.out.println(\"Gathering Ratings for Products\");    do{        String delimiters = \", \";        StringTokenizer gatherProducts[]=new StringTokenizer[inputLine, delimeters];        gatherProducts=fileIn.nextLine();    }while(fileIn.hasNextLine()==true);}   }\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
