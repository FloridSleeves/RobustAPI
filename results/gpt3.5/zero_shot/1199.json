We also create an empty list called \"positions\" to store the positions of each '1' in the binary number. We initialize the index variable to 0, which will keep track of the current position in the binary number.\n\nNext, we create a StringTokenizer object called \"tokenizer\" and pass the binary number and the delimiter '1' to it. This will split the binary number into tokens whenever a '1' is encountered.\n\nWe then enter a while loop that iterates as long as there are more tokens available. Inside the loop, we get the next token using the \"nextToken()\" method of the tokenizer. This token will be the substring between two consecutive '1's in the binary number.\n\nWe update the index variable by adding the length of the token to it. This gives us the position of the '1' in the binary number.\n\nFinally, we add the index to the positions list and continue to the next iteration of the loop.\n\nAfter the loop finishes, we print the positions list, which will contain the positions of each '1' in the binary number."

Anyways...Take for example, an 8 bit binary representation of a number in String format, \"01110101\". If I reverse the number, I get \"10101110\". If I wanted to find the positions of each 1 and add them to an array, how would I go about doing that? I tried to use indexOf('1'), but it keeps returning 0 or 1 as the index. Edit: By end result, I mean the overall goal I'm trying to accomplish with all of this, not the question I'm asking. I just wanted to keep someone from jumping in and telling me exactly how to convert from binary to dec rather than answering my current question...Edit2: Okay, I'll be more specific. Basically, I'm trying to take a binary number(s), flip them around and get the positions of the ones and add them to an array. Then I'm going to try to iterate through the array, taking 2 to the power of each position and adding them up. Maybe not the most efficient way to convert from binary to decimal, but it's what I came up with. \nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
