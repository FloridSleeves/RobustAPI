The code snippet provided initializes the cipher in the decryption mode using the private key. However, it does not specify the transformation algorithm for the cipher. The transformation algorithm determines the encryption algorithm, padding scheme, and mode of operation.\n\nTo fix the issue, you need to specify the transformation algorithm when initializing the cipher. For example, if you want to use RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding, you can modify the code as follows:\n\nrsacipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, pk, new RSAEngine());\n\nMake sure to replace \"RSAEngine()\" with the appropriate transformation algorithm that you want to use.\n\nAdditionally, make sure that the private key you are using is valid and matches the public key used for encryption."

In this method, the AES key is supposed to be deciphered by using an RSA CipherInputStream.public void loadKey(File in, byte[] privateKey) throws GeneralSecurityException, IOException {    PKCS8EncodedKeySpec privateKeySpec = new PKCS8EncodedKeySpec(privateKey);    KeyFactory kf = KeyFactory.getInstance(\"RSA\");    PrivateKey pk = kf.generatePrivate(privateKeySpec);    rsacipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, pk);    aesKey = new byte[128/8];    FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(in);    CipherInputStream input = new CipherInputStream(fis, rsacipher);    input.read(aesKey);    aesKeySpec = new SecretKeySpec(aesKey, \"AES\");    input.close();    fis.close(); } the FileInputStream gives me the encoded key (it is not the problem) but when passed through the CipherInputStream, the data becomes all zeroes. aesKey and aesKeySpec are static variables, privateKey is a valid RSA key.Any help in finding the problem would be much appreciated!\nPlease using this api: Cipher.init.\nAnswer:"
