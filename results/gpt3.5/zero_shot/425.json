We initialize the iterator and get the first element using `iterator.next()`. Then, we enter a while loop that continues as long as there are more elements in the ArrayList. Inside the loop, we get the next element using `iterator.next()` and compare it with the current element. If they are equal, we remove the duplicate using `iterator.remove()`. If they are not equal, we update the current element to be the next element. This way, we are able to remove duplicates even if they are right next to each other."

I have no idea what I am doing wrong. Right now I have nested for loops comparing an int to the rest in the ArrayList. except how I either setup or increment I am skipping the duplicate next to where I start the first for loop over again. I have found it useful to reset my i=0 after I remove my index j. It still won't remove the duplicate if they are right next to each other.for(int i=0;i<original.size();i++){    for(int j=i+1;j<original.size();j++){        if(original.get(i)==original.get(j)){            original.remove(j);           }    }}EDIT: I found my solution, when I changed my second for loop to a while loop, then incremented each time, but when I found a duplicate I removed 1 from j. That way I would be starting over.Thank you all. \nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
