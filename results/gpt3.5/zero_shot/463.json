It then uses a HashMap to store the count of each character and a PriorityQueue to store the characters based on their count. The PriorityQueue ensures that the characters with the highest count are processed first. Finally, the code uses a StringBuilder to build the final result by appending the characters in the desired order."

What would be the most efficient way of accomplishing this task?UPDATE.As you can see the desired order is not alphabetical, that includes reverse. As I mentioned the objective is to group the strings and order them by first appearance. For this example I am using letter to simplify a (lot) more complex problem I am trying to solve. The thing to concentrate with here is the order on which the letter of each string appear. Grouping in a specific order, rather than ordering.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
