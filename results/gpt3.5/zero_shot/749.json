By using the FileWriter constructor with the \"append\" parameter set to true, you can open the file in append mode, allowing you to append content to it.\n\nIn the main method, you can create an instance of PrintWriter and assign it to the static variable. Then, you can use the writer to write content to the file. After calling each method, you can flush the writer to ensure that the content is written immediately to the file.\n\nIn the other methods, you can simply use the writer to append content to the file by calling the `println` method and then flushing the writer.\n\nFinally, remember to close the writer in the main method to release any system resources associated with it."
