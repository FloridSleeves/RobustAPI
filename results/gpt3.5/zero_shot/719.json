First, set the content type of the response to \"text/html\" using response.setContentType(\"text/html\"). Then, create a PrintWriter object using response.getWriter(). Next, use the PrintWriter.write method to write a <script> tag and assign the boardSize value to a JavaScript variable. Finally, close the PrintWriter using out.close(). This will send the boardSize value to the JavaScript code in the BoardGame.html."

I am working with NetBeans and tomcat as the server for testing. I have the GameSettings.html which the user choose the board size and press submit.  The data is being sent to servlet named: GameSettingsServlet.java  There I pull out the boardSize and parse it to an integer:  @Overrideprotected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)        throws ServletException, IOException {   createEngine(request);   processRequest(request, response);}private void createEngine(HttpServletRequest request){    int boardSize = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter(\"boardSize\"));    int numberOfPlayers = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter(\"numberOfPlayers\"));    m_Engine = new Engine(boardSize, numberOfPlayers );}I want to create the board with javaScript so I need to send the boardSize parameter to the   javaScript (which should run on BoardGame.html)  in order to know how much rows and columns to create.How can I pass the boardSize to the javaScript or HTML ?I searched on the web but I found only about JSP and I need it on HTML.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
