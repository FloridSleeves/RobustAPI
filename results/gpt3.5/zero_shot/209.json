Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to do it:\n\n1. Create a `URL` object with the URL of the .pls file.\n2. Open an `InputStream` from the URL using `url.openStream()`.\n3. Create a `BufferedReader` to read the contents of the .pls file.\n4. Read each line of the .pls file using `reader.readLine()`.\n5. Check if the line starts with \"File\" using `line.startsWith(\"File\")`.\n6. If it does, split the line by \"=\" to extract the URL using `line.split(\"=\")`.\n7. Stream the extracted URL using your preferred method (e.g., JMF, JavaFX, etc.).\n8. Close the `BufferedReader` and `InputStream` to release resources.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the .pls file has the URL listed under a line starting with \"File\". You may need to adjust the code if your .pls file has a different format."

However, it seems I cannot find a way to do it.. I tried with JMF, but I get java.io.IOException: Invalid Http response everytime I run the code.Here is what I tried:Player player = Manager.createPlayer(new URL(\"http://50.7.98.106:8398\"));player.start();The .pls file:[playlist]NumberOfEntries=1File1=http://50.7.98.106:8398/In the piece of code above I'm setting the URL by hand, just for testing, but I've sucessfuly done the .pls downloading code and it's working, and from this I make another question, is it a better approach to just simply play the .pls file locally? Can it be done?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
