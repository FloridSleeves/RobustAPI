Instead, you can use `DataOutputStream.write` and `DataInputStream.readFully` to ensure that the entire file data is sent and received correctly.\n\nIn the server-side code, after reading the file data into the `buffer`, we first write the length of the buffer using `dos.writeInt(buffer.length)`. This allows the client to know the length of the incoming data. Then, we write the buffer itself using `dos.write(buffer)`. Finally, we flush the `DataOutputStream` to ensure that all the data is sent.\n\nIn the client-side code, we first read the length of the incoming data using `dis.readInt()`. Then, we create a buffer of the appropriate length and use `dis.readFully(buffer)` to read the entire data into the buffer. After that, we proceed with writing the buffer to the file as before.\n\nBy using `DataOutputStream.write` and `DataInputStream.readFully`, we ensure that the entire file data is sent and received correctly, which may help resolve the issue you were facing."

Thanks in advance.Here is the sending server-thread codetry{       out.println(\"AcceptFile,\");    FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(fn);    byte[] buffer = new byte[fis.available()];    fis.read(buffer);    ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream()) ;    oos.writeObject(buffer);    oos.flush();}catch(Exception c){    System.err.println(\"exc\" + c);}Here is the Client-thread receivingtry{    ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(socket.getInputStream());                    byte[] buffer = (byte[])ois.readObject();                    String pic=\"copy\"+studId+\".pdf\";                    System.out.println(pic);                    FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(pic);                    fos.write(buffer);                      fos.flush();                    fos.close();    }catch(Exception e){    System.out.println(\"Exception writing\");}\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:"
