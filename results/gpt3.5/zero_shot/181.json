We then write the command to the output stream and flush it to ensure it is sent. \n\nNext, we create a buffer to read the input stream and a `StringBuilder` to store the received data. We enter a loop where we read from the input stream into the buffer and append it to the `StringBuilder`. \n\nWe check if there is more data available in the input stream using `inputStream.available()`. If there is no more data available, we add the contents of the `StringBuilder` to the result list and create a new `StringBuilder` to store the next set of data. \n\nFinally, we check if there is any remaining data in the `StringBuilder` and add it to the result list if necessary. \n\nNote that this code assumes that the command execution will return the output in chunks, with each chunk being available for reading from the input stream. If the output is not chunked, you may need to modify the code accordingly."

I want to create a library using JSch from some other apps I am looking to write.  I have the connections ironed out but I am using stdin and stdout right now.I am looking to have a method that accepts a single command in a String and returns an ArrayList with the results.Any assistance would be great!//This vars are in the class.private JSch _jsch;private Session _session;private Channel _channel;Here is my connection methodpublic boolean Connect () throws JSchException{    try {        _jsch = new JSch();        _session = _jsch.getSession(_user, _hostname, _port);              _session.setPassword(_password);        _session.setConfig(\"StrictHostKeyChecking\", \"no\");          _channel = _session.openChannel(\"shell\");        //((ChannelShell)_channel).setPtyType(\"vt100\");        _channel.setInputStream(bais);        _channel.setOutputStream(baos);        _channel.connect(3000);                         }//try to connect    catch (JSchException ex)    {        throw ex;    }    return true;}The goal is once I open the connection I can send this method a command and return the results in an array.  Act based on the results and send more commands.  I don't want to close the connection each time as they will build on the commands that come before it. I am not sure how to work with the Inputs and Output Streams enough to get the results I am looking for.  If you can assist with filling out the following method, I would be grateful.public List<String> ExecuteCommand (String command) {    //run command to existing connection    //Get returned lines to Array List and return the list}Thanks \nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
