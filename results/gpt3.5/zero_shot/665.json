However, when you call the `close()` method on the PrintWriter object, it also closes the underlying output stream, which in turn closes the socket.\n\nIn the given code, when you call `out.close()`, it closes the PrintWriter object and the underlying output stream, which results in closing the socket as well. As a result, the subsequent read operation fails because the socket is no longer open.\n\nTo avoid this issue, you can use the `shutdownOutput()` method provided by the Socket class. This method only closes the output stream channel of the socket, while keeping the socket itself alive. Here's an example:\n\n```\nSocket socket = new Socket(\"localhost\", 8080);\nPrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true);\nout.write(\"Hello\");\nsocket.shutdownOutput();\n```\n\nIn this code, calling `socket.shutdownOutput()` correctly closes the output stream channel, allowing the subsequent read operation to work without closing the socket."
