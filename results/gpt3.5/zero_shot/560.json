Here's an example:\n\n```java\nIterator<Map.Entry<KeyType, ValueType>> iterator = map.entrySet().iterator();\nint count = 0;\nwhile (iterator.hasNext() && count < k) {\n    iterator.next();\n    iterator.remove();\n    count++;\n}\n```\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nThis code snippet uses an iterator to iterate over the entries of the map. The `iterator.next()` method is called to move the iterator to the next entry, and then `iterator.remove()` is called to remove that entry from the map. The `count` variable keeps track of the number of elements removed so far, and the loop continues until either there are no more elements in the map or `k` elements have been removed. This approach allows you to remove elements from the map without iterating over all of them, making it more efficient."

I want it cut down to size... I don't care which elements I remove, I just want k of the elements removed.What's the most efficient way to do this (other than iterating)?Edit: k is not known in advance. Suggestions to based on other kinds of maps are relevant.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
