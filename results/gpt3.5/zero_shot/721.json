Then, you can use the File.listFiles method to get all the files in the target directory.\n\nNext, you can iterate over each file and check if it is a .txt file using the File.isFile and File.getName methods. If it is a .txt file, you can create a BufferedReader to read the contents of the file.\n\nInside the while loop, you can read each line from the file using the BufferedReader.readLine method and write it to the output file using the PrintWriter.println method.\n\nFinally, make sure to close the BufferedReader and PrintWriter to release any system resources.\n\nNote: In the provided code, I have made some modifications to fix the issue with the original code. The PrintWriter was being closed inside the while loop, resulting in an empty output file. I have also added exception handling to handle any potential IOExceptions."
