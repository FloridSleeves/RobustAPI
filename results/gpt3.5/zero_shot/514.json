You can then call the transmitMessage() method on the selected service to transmit the message.\n\nb) Using Events, you can define a custom event (e.g., MessageEvent) and fire it whenever a message is received. All services that observe this event will be notified, and you can handle the transmission of the message within each service based on their own rules.\n\nc) Annotated Injection allows you to inject specific implementations of SocialNetworkService using annotations. You can have separate injections for each service implementation (e.g., @Twitter, @Facebook) and select the appropriate one based on the message's social network. This approach can become cumbersome if the number of service implementations grows.\n\nChoose the approach that best suits your requirements and the complexity of your application."

I.e if i dont support dont transmit...c). i could have annotaded injection i.e@Twitter, @Facebook all in a controller bean and then select the appropriate but my service implementations number will grow....Thanks in advance,Dimitri\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
