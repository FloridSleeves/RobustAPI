Since the \"createResult\" object is of type java.util.HashMap, you can call the get method on it and pass in the key \"bugs\" to retrieve the value associated with that key. This will give you the array of hashes containing the bugs information."

Object createResult = rpcClient.execute(\"Bug.search\", new Object[]{bugMap});how do i get bugs information from : \"createResult\" object.ie, contents of cretaeResult object.According to Bugzilla documentation two items are returned, bugs and faults, both are array of hashes. and i want to access these.\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:"
