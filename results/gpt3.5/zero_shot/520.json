It uses an `Iterator` to iterate over the elements in the set and appends each element to a `StringBuilder`. After each element, it checks if there are more elements using `iterator.hasNext()`. If there are more elements, it appends the delimiter. Finally, it returns the string representation of the `StringBuilder`. This method can be used with sets of any type, as long as the type implements the `toString()` method."

And I know I can do it in separate functions using a loop. But I just don't want to be tedious and want to do it in one function using Java Generics or whatever that can help. I have done some brain storm but in vain. :(Any idea is appreciated!\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
