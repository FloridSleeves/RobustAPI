Without seeing the code, it is difficult to determine the exact cause of the java.lang.AssertionError.\n\nHowever, the java.lang.AssertionError typically occurs when an assertion statement fails. This means that the code is encountering a condition that it expects to be true, but it is actually false. In the case of the iterator test, it is likely that the test is expecting a certain value from the iterator's next() method, but the actual value returned by the next() method is different.\n\nTo fix this issue, you should review the implementation of your iterator in the SortedArrayList class. Make sure that the iterator is returning the elements in the expected order and that it is not skipping any elements. Additionally, check if there are any conditions or constraints that need to be met for the iterator to work correctly.\n\nIf you can provide more information or code snippets, I can provide a more specific solution to your problem."

My professor send us a JUnit test so we can know if our code is working correctly. Now every method has passed the test except the iterator test which fails the test. It appears to be a java.lang.AssertionError and I cant seem to figure out a way of fixing it. If you could see the error and point it out to me would be awesome. Thanks in advance\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
