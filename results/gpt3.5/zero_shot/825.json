This can cause issues when writing a large amount of data, as the buffer may not be flushed properly. To write a large amount of data correctly, you should use the `write` method instead, which does not add a newline character.\n\nIn the updated code, we use the `write` method to write the entire `result` string to the file. Additionally, we close the PrintWriter after writing to ensure that all data is flushed to the file.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\nString result = acquireLengthyData();\nPrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(\"D:/log.txt\");\nout.write(result);\nout.close();"
