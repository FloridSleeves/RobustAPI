The `FibonacciIterator` class keeps track of the current and next Fibonacci numbers. The `hasNext()` method always returns true, indicating that there are more elements in the collection. The `next()` method returns the current Fibonacci number and updates the current and next numbers accordingly. This allows you to iterate over the Fibonacci sequence and get the elements without recalculating them."

To be useful, such collection should keep already once counted elements and get() them without recounting. The counting of elements should happen in lazy way, at first need. Thus, no member will have to be calculated more than once. In such way we'll a structure that will look like a recursively defined sequence, and will be fast and reusable. When I started to study Java 8 I thought that Stream works in that way. But it does not, for the stream cannot be used twice.I thought about the following construction:IntStream fi;fi=IntStream.iterate(0, i -> fi[i-1]+fi[i-2]);But that way it won't work - I can't get an item from the stream by index.The other problem is that if I'll later go along the stream, it will be consumed and I can't use it repeatedly. If I copy the stream to List, it is not lazy anymore.As a result, I need some construction that I can address by index. As fibo(i). Edit. Obviously, the solution cannot be a stream, for the stream cannot be used twice. I don't want to repeat all calculations on every call to F(i).\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
