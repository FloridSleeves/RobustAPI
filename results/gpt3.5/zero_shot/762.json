                "content": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: \nOne alternative to extending PrintWriter and overriding each method is to create a helper method that takes in a PrintWriter and the text to be written, and then iterate over an array of PrintWriter objects to write the text to each one. Here's an example:\n\n```java\npublic class MultiplePrintWriter {\n    private PrintWriter[] outs;\n\n    public MultiplePrintWriter(PrintWriter[] outs) {\n        this.outs = outs;\n    }\n\n    public void write(String text) {\n        for (PrintWriter out : outs) {\n            out.write(text);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou can then use this helper class to write the same text to multiple files or streams by calling the `write` method with the desired text. This approach avoids the need to override each method in PrintWriter.\n\nAs for whether this functionality is already implemented in a library, I am not aware of any specific library that provides this exact functionality. However, you can achieve similar results using libraries like Apache Commons IO or Guava, which provide utility classes for working with files and streams. These libraries may have methods that can simplify writing to multiple files or streams."
