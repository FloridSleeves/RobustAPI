In your for loop, you are creating a new iterator for each iteration, which means that you are always getting the first shape in the list. To fix this, you need to move the iterator creation outside of the for loop and use the iterator's next() method to get the next shape in each iteration.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\npublic void printShapes(ArrayList<String> numbers){\n    Iterator<Shape> iter = this.shapes.iterator(); // move iterator creation outside of the for loop\n    for(String s:numbers){\n        if(iter.hasNext()){ // check if there is a next shape\n            Shape shape = iter.next(); // get the next shape\n            shape.printMe(s);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWith this change, the output will be:\nThis is Circle no: 1\nThis is Square no: 2\nThis is Triangle no: 3"
