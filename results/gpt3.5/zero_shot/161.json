                "content": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: You can create a constrained InputStream by using the FileInputStream class and overriding the read() method to limit the number of bytes read. Here's an example:\n\n```java\nimport java.io.FileInputStream;\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.io.InputStream;\n\npublic class ConstrainedInputStream extends InputStream {\n    private FileInputStream fileInputStream;\n    private long currentPosition;\n    private long endPosition;\n\n    public ConstrainedInputStream(String filePath, long startPosition, long endPosition) throws IOException {\n        fileInputStream = new FileInputStream(filePath);\n        fileInputStream.skip(startPosition);\n        currentPosition = startPosition;\n        this.endPosition = endPosition;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public int read() throws IOException {\n        if (currentPosition >= endPosition) {\n            return -1; // EOF\n        }\n        int byteRead = fileInputStream.read();\n        currentPosition++;\n        return byteRead;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void close() throws IOException {\n        fileInputStream.close();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou can then use this ConstrainedInputStream to read only a certain range of bytes from a file. For example, to read bytes from position 0 to 100:\n\n```java\ntry (ConstrainedInputStream inputStream = new ConstrainedInputStream(\"path/to/file\", 0, 100)) {\n    int byteRead;\n    while ((byteRead = inputStream.read()) != -1) {\n        // Process the byte\n    }\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the ConstrainedInputStream skips the bytes before the start position and stops reading once the end position is reached. The client code will see EOF once the 100th byte is reached."
