This method returns the index of the last cell contained in the row, which can be used to determine the size or length of the column. In the code snippet provided, we assume that the column you want to get the size of is in the first row of the sheet. The getLastCellNum() method returns the index of the last cell in the row, so adding 1 to it will give you the size or length of the column."
