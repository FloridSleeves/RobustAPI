Create a PrintWriter object and pass the file name to its constructor. This will create a new file or overwrite the existing file with the same name.\n2. Use a for loop to iterate from 1 to 10 (or any desired range).\n3. Inside the loop, construct the output string with the desired format.\n4. Use the `write()` method of the PrintWriter object to write the output string to the file.\n5. After the loop, close the PrintWriter object to ensure that all the data is written to the file.\n\nNote: Make sure to handle any exceptions that may occur while working with files, such as IOException."
