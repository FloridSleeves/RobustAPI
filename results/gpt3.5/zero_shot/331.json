It creates a StringBuilder to store the combined string and an Iterator to iterate over the array. The iterator.next() method is used to retrieve each string from the array, and the StringBuilder.append() method is used to append it to the combined string. The delimiter is appended after each string, except for the last one. Finally, the StringBuilder.toString() method is called to return the combined string."

An opposite to split().Wanted to ask the forum before I try writing my own (since the JDK has everything)\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
