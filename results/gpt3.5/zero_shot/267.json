Here's an example:\n\nif (sections.containsValue(line)) {\n    // line contains a value from the LinkedHashMap\n    // do something\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The issue you are facing is because you are trying to compare a string value with an object. In your code, you are storing the values of the LinkedHashMap as objects. To compare the values as strings, you need to convert the object to a string using the toString() method.\n\nIn your code, you can modify the following lines:\n\nObject nextSection;\nnextSection = me.getValue();\nnextSection = nextSection.toString();\n\nto:\n\nString nextSection;\nnextSection = me.getValue().toString();\n\nThis will ensure that the value stored in nextSection is of type String, allowing you to compare it with the line using line.contains(nextSection).\n\nAdditionally, make sure to use the equals() method instead of the == operator to compare strings. So, instead of:\n\nif (sectionName == me.getValue()) {\n\nuse:\n\nif (sectionName.equals(me.getValue())) {\n\nThis will compare the string values correctly."

I am defining the linked hash map as follows... LinkedHashMap<String, String> sections; sections = new LinkedHashMap();Then, I have collected lines of text from a pdf. If certain conditions are met, II split the text on a white space putting the numerical value \"#######\" as the key and the rest of the line as the value... if (tocStartFound == true && tocEndFound == false) {     if (line.matches(\"\\\\d{6}.+\")){     String lineSplit[] = line.split(\"\\\\s\",2);     sections.put(lineSplit[0], lineSplit[1]); }Now, when i ask if line.contains(nextSection) I am told an \"object cannot be converted to a charSequence.\"if (sectionStarted == true){    Set set = sections.entrySet();    Iterator iter = set.iterator();    boolean foundName = false;    Object nextSection;    while(iter.hasNext()){        Map.Entry me = (Map.Entry)iter.next();        if (foundName == true){            nextSection = me.getValue();            nextSection = nextSection.toString();            break;        }        if (sectionName == me.getValue()) {            foundName = true;        }}Pattern pa = Pattern.compile(\".+((?i)end of section).+\");Matcher ma = pa.matcher(line);if (ma.find() || line.contains(nextSection)){    System.out.println(\"End of Section\");    sectionStarted = false;}I guess I thought by defining the map with <string,string>, i was enduring that the data would be typed as strings.
