Then, you can create a buffer of a specific size (e.g., 1024 bytes) to read the file in chunks. \n\nInside a try-with-resources block, create an `InputStream` object (e.g., `FileInputStream`) to read the file. Use a while loop to read the file in chunks until the end of the file is reached (`in.read(buffer) != -1`). \n\nFor each chunk read, update the `totalBytesRead` variable by adding the number of bytes read (`bytesRead`). Calculate the progress as a percentage using the formula `(totalBytesRead * 100) / fileSize`. \n\nFinally, update the progress bar with the calculated progress value. You can replace the comment `// Update the progress bar with the 'progress' value` with the code to update your specific progress bar component."
