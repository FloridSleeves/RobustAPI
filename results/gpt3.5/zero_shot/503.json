The Iterator provides a safe way to remove elements from a collection while iterating over it. \n\nIn the given code, you can create an Iterator for the ArrayList using the iterator() method. Then, you can use a while loop to iterate over the elements using the hasNext() method to check if there are more elements. Inside the loop, you can use the next() method to get the next element and perform your desired operations. If you want to remove an element, you can use the remove() method of the Iterator. This will remove the current element from the ArrayList.\n\nIn your case, you can modify your code as shown above. Instead of using the for-each loop, you can create an Iterator for the ArrayList and use it to iterate over the elements. If the condition is met, you can use the remove() method of the Iterator to remove the current element from the ArrayList."

Trying to remove it like in the sample code below doesn't want to work. How could I get to the iterator of current px object in this loop to remove it?    for( Pixel px : pixel){ [...]  if(px.y > gHeigh){     pixel.remove(pixel.indexOf(px)); // here is the thing     pixel.remove(px); //doesn't work either  }}\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
