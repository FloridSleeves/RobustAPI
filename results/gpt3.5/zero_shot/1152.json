We then create a StringTokenizer object by passing the input string and a delimiter (in this case, a space) to the constructor.\n\nWe then iterate through each token using the `hasMoreTokens()` and `nextToken()` methods of the StringTokenizer object. For each token, we check if it ends with \"-PRP\" or contains \"-PRP\". If it does not, we append it to a StringBuilder object called `output`.\n\nFinally, we convert the StringBuilder object to a string, trim any leading or trailing spaces, and print the result.\n\nThis code will remove all words that end with \"-PRP\" or contain \"-PRP\" from the list of words."
