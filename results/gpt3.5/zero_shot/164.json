We then obtain the input and error streams from the process using the getInputStream() and getErrorStream() methods. We create BufferedReader objects to read the output from these streams.\n\nWe use a while loop to read the output from the input and error streams line by line until there is no more output. This allows us to print the output to the console or perform any other necessary actions.\n\nAfter reading the output, we call the waitFor() method on the process to wait for the child process to complete. The waitFor() method will block the parent process until the child process has finished executing. The exit code of the child process is then obtained using the exitValue() method.\n\nBy using the InputStream.read API, we can read the output from the child process and ensure that the parent process waits for the child process to complete before continuing execution."

I have tried with runtime.exec and with processBuilder.pb: String cmd = \"ffmpeg -i input.vob output.mp4\" Runtime rt = Runtime.getRuntime();Process proc = rt.exec(cmd); proc.waitFor();This works fine with small input file (say less than 10 Mb). If I give larger input file then program will be hanged. Output file will be partially created and file creation will be hanged and control will not return. Even proc.join(10000); did not give any useful result. Here parent process is terminating before child process (ffmpeg) gets completed.How to overcome this problem?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
