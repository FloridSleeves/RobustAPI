In the first way, you correctly use the method by calling it on the string object \"word\". This converts the string \"word\" into a byte array and assigns it to the variable \"code\".\n\nHowever, in the second way, you are trying to call the method on the String class itself, passing the string \"word\" as a parameter. This is not the correct syntax for using the String.getBytes() method. The method should be called on a specific string object, not on the String class.\n\nTo fix the second way, you should use the first way by calling the method on the string object \"word\" as shown in the first example."
