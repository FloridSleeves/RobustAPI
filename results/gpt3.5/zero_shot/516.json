This feature automatically generates the required methods for the selected interface and adds them to the class. To use this feature, right-click on the class in the Package Explorer, go to Source, then select \"Generate Delegate Methods\". In the dialog that appears, select the interface you want to implement (in this case, Iterator<Integer>) and click Finish. Eclipse will generate the necessary methods for the interface and add them to the class."
