It allows you to specify a delimiter and then iterate over the tokens using the hasMoreTokens() and nextToken() methods. In this case, we are using \"/\" as the delimiter. We create a List to store the tokens and then convert it to an array using the toArray() method. This approach can be faster than split() method in some cases, but it is recommended to measure the performance in your specific application to determine the actual improvement."

Also, the split method takes a regular expression, which is superfluous here.What alternative can I use in order to optimize the string splitting? Is StringUtils.split faster?(I would've tried and tested myself but profiling my application takes a lot of time.)\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
