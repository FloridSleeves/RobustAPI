Here's an example:\n\n```java\ntry (InputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream(\"input.txt\")) {\n    int bit;\n    while ((bit = inputStream.read()) != -1) {\n        // Process the bit\n        System.out.print(bit);\n    }\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n```\n\nTo write bits to a file, you can use the OutputStream class along with the write() method. Here's an example:\n\n```java\ntry (OutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream(\"output.txt\")) {\n    int bit = 1; // Example bit value\n    outputStream.write(bit);\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n```\n\nNote that the read() method returns an integer representing the next byte of data, or -1 if the end of the file is reached. You can process the bits as needed within the while loop.\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nTo read bits from a file in Java, you can use the InputStream class along with the read() method.
