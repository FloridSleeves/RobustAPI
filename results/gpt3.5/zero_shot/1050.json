The `Trace` class represents a single trace with an access type and a memory address. The code reads the file line by line, splits each line using `StringTokenizer`, and parses the access type and memory address. Then, a new `Trace` object is created and added to the `traces` list. Finally, you can process each trace in the `traces` list as needed. This approach avoids loading the entire file into memory at once, which helps prevent out of heap space errors when dealing with large files."

First I need to read 1 or more trace files. Each contains memory addresses for each access. Example: 0 F001CBAD2 EEECA89F0 EBC17910...Where the first integer indicates a read/write etc. then the hex memory address follows. With this data, I am supposed to run a simulation. So the idea I had was parse these data into an ArrayList<Trace> (for now I am using Java) with trace being a simple class containing the memory address and the access type (just a String and an integer). After which I plan to loop through these array lists to process them. The problem is even at parsing, it running out of heap space. Each trace file is ~200MB. I have up  to 8. Meaning minimum of ~1.6 GB of data I am trying to \"cache\"? What baffles me is I am only parsing 1 file and java is using 2GB according to my task manager ... What is a better way of doing this? A code snippet can be found at Code Review\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
