The '\\ufeff' character is written to the writer, which represents the UTF-8 BOM (Byte Order Mark). The writer is then flushed to ensure that the data is written to the underlying stream."

Oracle database also has a NLS_CHARACTERSET value of UTF8.Please suggest.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
