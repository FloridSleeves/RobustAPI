                "content": "<<<api>>>: Activity.setContentView\n<<<code>>>: \nIn your MainActivity.java file, you can use the Activity.setContentView method to set the layout for your activity. You can create two different layouts, one for phones and one for tablets, and use the appropriate layout depending on the device.\n\nFirst, create two layout files in your res/layout folder: activity_main_phone.xml and activity_main_tablet.xml. In activity_main_phone.xml, you can have the button enabled and clickable, while in activity_main_tablet.xml, you can have the button disabled and the text changed.\n\nIn your MainActivity.java file, you can check if the device is a tablet or a phone using the following code:\n\n```java\nboolean isTablet = getResources().getBoolean(R.bool.isTablet);\n```\n\nThen, based on the value of isTablet, you can set the appropriate layout using the setContentView method:\n\n```java\nif (isTablet) {\n    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main_tablet);\n} else {\n    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main_phone);\n}\n```\n\nThis way, when the app is first opened on a tablet, the button will be disabled and the text will be changed without the user having to click the button first.\n\nNote: To determine if the device is a tablet or a phone, you can create a boolean resource in your res/values folder. Create a new file called bool.xml and add the following code:\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<resources>\n    <bool name=\"isTablet\">false</bool>\n</resources>\n```\n\nThen, create another bool.xml file in the res/values-sw600dp folder (create the folder if it doesn't exist) and add the following code:\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<resources>\n    <bool name=\"isTablet\">true</bool>\n</resources>\n```\n\nThis will set the isTablet boolean to true for devices with a smallest width of 600dp, which is typically the threshold for tablets."

This simple app would just contain a button that would use the call intent to call a specific number. I would like to install this app on both tablets and phone but when it is installed on the tablet, I would like the button to be disabled during runtime so errors wouldn't show when the user tries to call using the tablet without a call function. At the moment, I am using the setEnabled() and setClickable() method in my MainActivity.java and setting it to false when the user clicks on the button the first time. My question is whether the button can be disabled and the text changed during runtime or when the app is first opened (in a tablet) so the user wouldn't have to click the button first for it to show that the \"call\" button should be disabled and unclickable?\nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer:"
