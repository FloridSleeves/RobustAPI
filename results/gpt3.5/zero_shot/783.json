The exception you are getting, \"NoSuchElementException\", occurs when there are no more tokens to be read from the StringTokenizer. In your case, it seems that the second line of the data file does not contain any tokens.\n\nTo fix this issue, you can add a check to ensure that there are enough tokens available before calling the nextToken() method. Here's an updated version of your code that includes the check:\n\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.*;\n\nclass dothis {\n  public static void main (String [] args) throws IOException {\n    BufferedReader f = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"ride.in\"));\n    PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(\"ride.out\")));\n    StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(f.readLine());\n    String s1 = st.nextToken();\n    \n    if (st.hasMoreTokens()) {\n      String s2 = st.nextToken();\n      char[] arr = new char[6];\n      if (find(s1, arr, 1) == find(s2, arr, 1)) {\n        out.print(\"one\");\n      } else {\n        out.println(\"two\");\n      }\n    } else {\n      out.println(\"Not enough tokens in the second line\");\n    }\n    \n    out.close();\n  }\n}\n\nBy adding the check \"if (st.hasMoreTokens())\", you ensure that there are enough tokens available before trying to read the second token. If there are not enough tokens, you can handle it accordingly, as shown in the example above."

However, the two first lines of this data file both contain a String. How come a token would not be read for the second line?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
