It is not updating the hasNext variable properly. The correct implementation should be to check if the iterator has a next element, and if it does, move the iterator to the next element and update the hasNext variable accordingly.\n\nIn the modified code, we initialize a boolean variable hasNext to keep track of whether there is a next element or not. In the constructor, we check if the iterator has a next element and update the hasNext variable accordingly.\n\nIn the hasNext() method, we simply return the value of the hasNext variable.\n\nIn the next() method, we first get the next element from the iterator. Then, we check if the iterator has a next element. If it does, we move the iterator to the next element. If it doesn't, we update the hasNext variable to false.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the hasNext() method correctly returns whether there is a next element or not, and the next() method returns the next element while also moving the iterator to the next element if it exists."

The next() function will return iterator.next().next()I have implemented below code, it doesn't look elegant at all.And for list {1, 9, 8, 7, 8, 2, 5}, it will only output 9, 7, 2.Any clue to do it in a better way?Basically this jump iterator is trying to iterator each element with one distance, for example, for 1,2,3,4,5, it will return 1,3,5public class JumpIterator implements Iterator<Integer> {    private Iterator<Integer> it;    public JumpIterator(List<Integer> list){        it = list.iterator();    }    @Override    public boolean hasNext() {        if(!it.hasNext()){            return false;        }else{            it.next();            return it.hasNext();        }    }    @Override    public Integer next() {        return it.next();    }}\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
