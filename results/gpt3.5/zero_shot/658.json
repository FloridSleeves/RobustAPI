The keys of the Map will be the names of the instances, and the values will be the instances themselves. In the get_A_byName method, you can simply use the Map.get method to retrieve the instance of A by its name. If the name does not exist in the Map, the get method will return null."

B contains the instances of A. I want to return instance of A from B by its name:class A{    public String name;    public A (String name)    {        this.name = name;    }}class B{    public A a1;    public A a2;    public A a3;    public B ()    {        this.a1 = new A (\"a1\");        this.a2 = new A (\"a2\");        this.a3 = new A (\"a3\");    }    public A get_A_byName (String name)    {        // Is it possible to write something like this? B will always contain only instances of A        for (A a : B.variables)        {            if (a.name.equals(name))            {                return a;            }            // Or in case A doesn't have a variable \"name\", can I get an A instance by its declared name in B?            if (a.getClass().getName().equals(name))            {                return a;            }        }    }}Is it possible to do things described in code's comments?
