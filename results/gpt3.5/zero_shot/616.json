Then, you can use the Map.get method to retrieve the array based on the variable name and pass it as a parameter to the method. In this example, the arrays are stored in a Map called \"arrays\" and you can retrieve the array using arrays.get(arrayToBeInvokedWith), where arrayToBeInvokedWith is the variable name in String format."

Perhaps storing the variables in an array? What I'd like to do, in case I'm faced with thousands of 2D arrays, is invoking the method with the value of a variable of a different data type, like this:String arrayToBeInvokedWith = \"array1\";method(arrayToBeInvokedWith){}(Yes, I do know this is too simplistic, but you can get the idea from it)Is there a similar solution? Any feedback is much appreciated.EDIT: All of the arrays have a same size.\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:"
