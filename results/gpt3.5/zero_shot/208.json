The `%02X` format specifier ensures that the string is always two characters long, with leading zeros if necessary. By printing the hex value followed by a space, you can achieve the desired format of \"00 11 21 31\"."

I want to read it in to a variable like you would see in a hex editor i.e 00 11 21 31 no single numbers as i need to scan the whole file and look for patterns which I know how to do I'm just stuck on this :/so in short i need a variabe to contain the two hex characters i.e int temp = 01 not int temp = 0 , I hope this all makes sense, I'm a little confused as it's 3am!If anyone knows how to do this I would be most greatful, p.s thanks for the help in advance this site has saved me loads of research and have learnt a lot!Many thanks.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
