The key of the outer map is the dayOfMonth, and the value is another map where the key is the courseCode and the value is the total headCount for that course on that day.\n- It reads each line of the file, extracts the necessary information using `StringTokenizer`, and updates the `attendanceMap` accordingly.\n- If the dayOfMonth is not already present in the `attendanceMap`, a new inner map is created for that day.\n- If the courseCode is already present in the inner map, the headCount is added to the existing value. Otherwise, a new entry is created with the courseCode and headCount.\n- Finally, it prints the attendance data for each day and course.\n\nNote: Replace \"file.txt\" with the actual file path in the code."

From my thinkering, this involves either reading the file a lot of times (ew!) or loading the three salient values (day, course, headcount) into some sort of array and operating on that instead.  Despite being fairly familiar with what a multi dimensional array is, this one has repeatedly caused my head to implode.  I've got the pseudo code for this program written out in front of me and my mind draws a blank when it comes to the line that defines the array.  The dayOfMonth can remain a string because it'll only be compared to another string. The courseCode obviously needs to be a string, too.  However, the headCount ideally would be numeric; it'll be added to as each line of the file is processed. The relationship between the three is basically that there can be many courseCodes per dayOfMonth, but only one headCount per courseCode as I'll be adding to it as I read it all into the array.So, in derpspeak, this is how it should roughly look:{String dayOfMonth = {{String courseCode}, {int headCount}}}The two issues I have here, are...a) that I'm not sure how to actually code this kind of funky array in there andb) as I can't really wrap my brain around it to begin with, there's a really good chance that I've essentially just designed something completely wrong for what I need.  Or impossible.  Both?For example, the array will start off empty.  I'd want to add a dayOfMonth, courseCode and headCount to start it off.  But I couldn't just go array.add(dayOfMonth) because it's expecting an array, leading me to suspect I should be using something else.  Argh!Oh god my brain. \nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
