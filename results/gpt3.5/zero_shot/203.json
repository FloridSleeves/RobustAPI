It avoids wasting random bits by only reading from the input stream when necessary.\n\nThe algorithm uses a `retVal` variable to store the accumulated bits and a `bits` variable to keep track of the number of bits in `retVal`. It also calculates a `mask` to ensure that only the lower 32 bits of `retVal` are considered.\n\nThe algorithm enters a loop that continues until a valid random number within the range is generated. Within the loop, it checks if there are at least 24 bits in `retVal`. If not, it reads a byte from the input stream and adds the bits to `retVal`. It then increments `bits` by 8.\n\nOnce there are at least 24 bits in `retVal`, the algorithm extracts the lower 32 bits using the `mask` and checks if the value is within the range. If it is, the value is returned. Otherwise, the algorithm shifts `retVal` to the right by 24 bits and decrements `bits` by 24.\n\nThis process continues until a valid random number is generated within the range.\n\nNote: The algorithm assumes that the input stream will not return -1 unless the end of the stream is reached. If the input stream can return -1 for other reasons, you may need to modify the code to handle this case appropriately."

Both the domain and the range are integers (more correctly, longs and not Z). What's an algorithm to do this?Implementation-wise, I have a function with this signature:long doRead(InputStream in, long rangeStart, long rangeEnd);in is based on a CSPRNG (fed by a hardware RNG, conditioned through SecureRandom) that I am required to use; the return value must be between rangeStart and rangeEnd, but the obvious implementation of this is wasteful:long doRead(InputStream in, long rangeStart, long rangeEnd) {    long retVal = 0;    long range = rangeEnd - rangeStart;    // Fill until we get to range    for (int i = 0; (1 << (8 * i)) < range; i++) {        int in = 0;        do {            in = in.read();        // but be sure we don't exceed range        } while(retVal + (in << (8 * i)) >= range);        retVal += in << (8 * i);     }    return retVal + rangeStart;}I believe this is effectively the same idea as (rand() * (max - min)) + min, only we're discarding bits that push us over max. Rather than use a modulo operator which may incorrectly bias the results to the lower values, we discard those bits and try again.  Since hitting the CSPRNG may trigger re-seeding (which can block the InputStream), I'd like to avoid wasting random bits.  Henry points out that this code biases against 0 and 257; Banthar demonstrates it in an example.First edit: Henry reminded me that summation invokes the Central Limit Theorem.  I've fixed the code above to get around that problem.Second edit: Mechanical snail suggested that I look at the source for Random.nextInt().  After reading it for a while, I realized that this problem is similar to the base conversion problem.  See answer below.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
