Here's an example code snippet:\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\n\npublic class FileComparator {\n    public static boolean compareFiles(String filePath1, String url) throws IOException {\n        File file1 = new File(filePath1);\n        InputStream inputStream1 = new FileInputStream(file1);\n        \n        InputStream inputStream2 = new URL(url).openStream();\n        \n        int byte1;\n        int byte2;\n        boolean areEqual = true;\n        \n        while ((byte1 = inputStream1.read()) != -1 && (byte2 = inputStream2.read()) != -1) {\n            if (byte1 != byte2) {\n                areEqual = false;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        \n        inputStream1.close();\n        inputStream2.close();\n        \n        return areEqual;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou can call the `compareFiles` method by passing the file path of the first file and the URL of the second file. It will return `true` if the files are equal and `false` otherwise.\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nThis code snippet uses the `InputStream.read` method to read the files byte by byte. It compares the bytes read from both files and breaks the loop if any mismatch is found. This approach avoids loading the entire files into memory, making it suitable for comparing large files without memory concerns."

We have tried to compare by byte[] arrays (we used HTTPRequestBuilder by Apache), but the concern is that the files may be too large and they may exhaust the memory. Do we have any good alternates.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
