Remove the element from the PriorityQueue using the remove() method.\n2. Update the reference of the element externally.\n3. Re-insert the updated element back into the PriorityQueue using the add() method.\n\nHere's an example code snippet:\n\nPriorityQueue<Integer> priorityQueue = new PriorityQueue<>();\npriorityQueue.add(5);\npriorityQueue.add(10);\npriorityQueue.add(3);\n\n// Remove an element\nint removedElement = priorityQueue.remove();\n\n// Update the reference externally\nremovedElement = 7;\n\n// Re-insert the updated element\npriorityQueue.add(removedElement);\n\n<<<explanation>>>: In order to update elements in a PriorityQueue, you need to remove the element, update its reference externally, and then re-insert it back into the PriorityQueue. This ensures that the PriorityQueue maintains its heap property and the ordering is maintained.\n\nRegarding your question about a Fibonacci heap implementation in Java, the java.util.PriorityQueue does not provide a direct implementation of a Fibonacci heap. However, you can implement your own Fibonacci heap data structure if needed."

When I initially insert the elements into the priority queue the ordering is maintained by the data structure. Now after a remove operation I update some of the references which are being held by the priority queue. Ideally this requires a reheapify operation on the priority queue but as is obvious since I am modifying selected references externally a reheapify cannot be triggered. So what is the best way to ensure that I am able to get the advantage of a heap like fast extract max in the presence of modifications to arbitrary elements inside the queue? I see I need a better data structure?To be more specific I need an implementation of something like a Fibonacci heap in Java.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithmIs that available?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
