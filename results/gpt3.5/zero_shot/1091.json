To assign COMBO to one string and ADEFGA to another string, you need to create the `StringTokenizer` outside the while loop and use it to tokenize each line separately. In the modified code, the `StringTokenizer` is created before the while loop and used to tokenize each line separately. The first token from the first line is assigned to the `combo` string, and the first token from the second line is assigned to the `adefga` string."

The \"ride.in\" file contains two lines, one containing the string \"COMBO\" and the other line containing the string \"ADEFGA\".  As I said, each string is on separate lines, so \"COMBO\" is on the first line, while \"ADEFGA\" is on the second line in the \"ride.in\" file.Here is my code: public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {File in = new File(\"ride.in\");File out = new File(\"ride.out\");String line;in.createNewFile();out.createNewFile();BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(in));PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(out)));while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {    StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(line);    String sam =st.nextToken();}pw.close();}    }I want to assign COMBO as one token and ADEFGA as another token, but in this code, both COMBO and ADEFGA are assigned to the sam string. How do I assign COMBO to one string, and ADEFGA to another string?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
