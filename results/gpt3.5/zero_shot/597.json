This map can contain values of type `String` or `List<String>`. \n\nTo work with objects that can be either `String` or `List<String>`, we can define two methods in the `Record` class: `getStringValue` and `getListValue`. \n\nThe `getStringValue` method takes a key as input and retrieves the value from the `attrs` map. If the value is of type `String`, it is returned as is. If the value is of type `List`, the first element of the list is returned as a string. If the value is neither a `String` nor a `List`, `null` is returned.\n\nThe `getListValue` method is similar to `getStringValue`, but it specifically returns the value as a `List<String>`. If the value is not a `List`, `null` is returned.\n\nBy using these methods, you can work with objects that can be either `String` or `List<String>` in a transparent manner."

Maybe I'm going about this the wrong way, but let's see where this question goes :)I would like a Map container that contains either Strings or lists of Strings. I want to enforce this rule during construction of this object so that you can't create a map with values that aren't either of those.e.g.class Record {  public Record(String key, Map<String,Object> attrs) {    // check that attrs only contains Objects which are Strings or List<Strings>  }}Other ways I have thought of to solve the problem might be...1)class Record {  public Record(String key, Map<String,String> attrs, Map<String,List<String>> multiAttrs) {    // ...  }}2)class Record {  public Record(String key, Map<String,Value> attrs) {    // ...  }}class Value {  // Create some funky class that encapsulates lists.  // Perhaps returning the only element in the list if the size is 1,  // but returning the list otherwise}I am not immediately excited at the alternatives, but I'm just putting it there as stuff I've already considered. Really I want the distinction between Strings and List to be transparent to the user of the class.\nPlease using this api: List.get.\nAnswer:"
