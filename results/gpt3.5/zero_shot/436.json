However, the issue with the loss of quality is due to the compression settings used when saving the images. By default, the ImageIO.write() method uses a compression quality of 0.75 for JPEG images, which can result in a smaller file size but lower image quality.\n\nTo maintain the resolution and improve the image quality, you can specify a higher compression quality value when saving the images. For example, you can use a value of 1.0 to indicate lossless compression:\n\nImageIO.write(b1, \"jpg\", outputfile); // Use higher compression quality\nImageIO.write(b2, \"jpg\", outputfile1); // Use higher compression quality\n\nAdditionally, if you want to split the image into equal parts based on file size, you can calculate the desired file size for each part and adjust the subimage dimensions accordingly. You can use the Iterator.next() method to iterate over the subimages and save them with the desired file size."

I am losing quality. 5 MB images gets divided into 400kB and 500kB parts. To maintain the resolution, it must get divided into 2.5 MB each. Please help. Here is the code below. Please help me.  import java.awt.*;import java.awt.image.*;import java.io.File;import javax.imageio.ImageIO;public class CutImange {   public CutImange() {    try{       Image image1 = ImageIO.read(new File(\"G:\\\\6.jpg\"));       BufferedImage buffered = (BufferedImage) image1;       BufferedImage b1=buffered.getSubimage(0, 0,(buffered.getWidth()/2), buffered.getHeight());       File outputfile = new File(\"G:\\\\imageq1.jpg\");       ImageIO.write(b1, \"jpg\", outputfile);       BufferedImageb2=buffered.getSubimage(buffered.getWidth()/2,0,buffered.getWidth()/2, buffered.getHeight());       File outputfile1 = new File(\"G:\\\\image1.jpg\");       ImageIO.write(b2, \"jpg\", outputfile1); }catch(Exception ex)    {        ex.printStackTrace();    }}public static void main(String[] args)   {    new CutImange();   } }I am creating this only for landscape images.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
