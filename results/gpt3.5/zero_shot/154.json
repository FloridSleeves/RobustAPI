Each client connection can be handled in a separate thread, allowing the server to handle multiple clients concurrently.\n\nHere's a basic outline of how you can approach this issue:\n\n1. Create a ServerSocket to listen for client connections.\n2. Accept client connections using the accept() method of ServerSocket.\n3. For each accepted client connection, create a new thread to handle the client.\n4. In the client thread, obtain the InputStream from the client socket using the getInputStream() method.\n5. Use a loop to continuously read messages from the client using the read() method of the InputStream.\n6. Process the received message as required (e.g., store it in a table).\n7. Send an acknowledgement back to the client if needed.\n8. Close the client socket and end the thread when the client disconnects.\n\nHere's an example code snippet to illustrate the above approach:\n\n```java\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.io.InputStream;\nimport java.net.ServerSocket;\nimport java.net.Socket;\n\npublic class SocketServer {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        try {\n            ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(1234);\n            System.out.println(\"Server started. Listening for client connections...\");\n\n            while (true) {\n                Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();\n                System.out.println(\"Client connected: \" + clientSocket.getInetAddress().getHostAddress());\n\n                Thread clientThread = new Thread(() -> {\n                    try {\n                        InputStream inputStream = clientSocket.getInputStream();\n                        byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\n                        int bytesRead;\n\n                        while ((bytesRead = inputStream.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n                            String message = new String(buffer, 0, bytesRead);\n                            System.out.println(\"Received message from client: \" + message);\n\n                            // Process the message and store it in the table\n\n                            // Send acknowledgement back to the client if needed\n                        }\n\n                        System.out.println(\"Client disconnected: \" + clientSocket.getInetAddress().getHostAddress());\n                        clientSocket.close();\n                    } catch (IOException e) {\n                        e.printStackTrace();\n                    }\n                });\n\n                clientThread.start();\n            }\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, each client connection is handled in a separate thread. The InputStream.read() method is used to read messages from the client. You can process the received messages and store them in a table as required. Additionally, you can send an acknowledgement back to the client if needed.\n\nNote that this is a basic example and you may need to handle exceptions, synchronization, and other aspects depending on your specific requirements."

Suppose there are 6 clients connected to the server at the same time and each of the clients are sending some commands to server at the same time. If these clients sending the message to server for every 1 second how can I handle the those messages from the 6 clients on the server side to store it in the table and the acknowledgement to each client. How can i handle these input from from the client. Whether I have to create 6 threads to handle these inputs from the client. Please give me a idea to approach this issue.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
