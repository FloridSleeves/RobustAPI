In the first loop, `hasNext()` is called in the loop condition, which adds an extra method call for each iteration. In the second loop, `hasNext()` is only called once before the loop starts, and then the loop continues until `it.hasNext()` returns false. This reduces the number of method calls and improves performance."

I'm asking because the times given by Junit are not too exact, but they give an approximate value\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
