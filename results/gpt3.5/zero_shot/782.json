However, you need to first create the \"Library\" directory and then create the file within it.\n\nTo do this, you can use the `mkdir()` method to create the directory and the `createNewFile()` method to create the file within the directory.\n\nAdditionally, you can use the `PrintWriter` class to write content to the file. In the provided code, I have added an example of how to write \"Hello, World!\" to the file using `PrintWriter.write()` method.\n\nMake sure to close the `PrintWriter` after writing to the file to release any system resources associated with it."
