                "content": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: \nFirst, you need to create a Spring controller that handles the autocomplete request and retrieves the suggested values from LDAP. Here's an example:\n\n```java\n@Controller\npublic class AutocompleteController {\n\n    @Autowired\n    private LdapTemplate ldapTemplate;\n\n    @RequestMapping(value = \"/autocomplete\", method = RequestMethod.GET)\n    public void autocomplete(@RequestParam(\"term\") String term, HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException {\n        List<String> suggestions = ldapTemplate.search(\n                LdapQueryBuilder.query().where(\"cn\").like(term + \"*\"),\n                (AttributesMapper<String>) attrs -> (String) attrs.get(\"cn\").get());\n\n        PrintWriter writer = response.getWriter();\n        for (String suggestion : suggestions) {\n            writer.println(suggestion);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `autocomplete` method handles the autocomplete request. It takes a `term` parameter which represents the user input and uses it to search for suggestions in LDAP. The suggestions are then written to the response using `PrintWriter.write`.\n\nNext, you need to create a JavaScript function that makes an AJAX request to the Spring controller and handles the response to populate the autocomplete field. Here's an example using jQuery:\n\n```javascript\n$(function() {\n    $(\"#autocompleteField\").autocomplete({\n        source: function(request, response) {\n            $.ajax({\n                url: \"/autocomplete\",\n                dataType: \"text\",\n                data: {\n                    term: request.term\n                },\n                success: function(data) {\n                    response(data.split(\"\\n\"));\n                }\n            });\n        }\n    });\n});\n```\n\nIn this example, the `source` option of the autocomplete widget is set to a function that makes an AJAX request to the `/autocomplete` URL with the user input as the `term` parameter. The response data is split by newline characters and passed to the `response` callback function to populate the autocomplete field.\n\nFinally, you need to include the necessary JavaScript and CSS files for the autocomplete widget. You can do this by adding the following lines to your HTML file:\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://code.jquery.com/ui/1.12.1/themes/base/jquery-ui.css\">\n<script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/ui/1.12.1/jquery-ui.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nMake sure to replace the URLs with the latest versions of jQuery and jQuery UI.\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nThis solution involves creating a Spring controller that handles the autocomplete request and retrieves the suggested values from LDAP. The controller uses the `LdapTemplate` class from Spring LDAP to perform the LDAP search. The suggestions are then written to the response using `PrintWriter.write`.\n\nOn the client-side, a JavaScript function is created using jQuery to make an AJAX request to the Spring controller and handle the response. The response data is split by newline characters and passed to the autocomplete widget to populate the autocomplete field.\n\nMake sure to include the necessary JavaScript and CSS files for the autocomplete widget in your HTML file."
