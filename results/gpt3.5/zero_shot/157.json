                "content": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: You can create a constrained InputStream by using the FileInputStream class and overriding the read() method to limit the number of bytes read. Here's an example:\n\n```java\nimport java.io.FileInputStream;\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.io.InputStream;\n\npublic class ConstrainedInputStream extends InputStream {\n    private FileInputStream fileInputStream;\n    private long currentPosition;\n    private long endPosition;\n\n    public ConstrainedInputStream(String filePath, long startPosition, long endPosition) throws IOException {\n        fileInputStream = new FileInputStream(filePath);\n        fileInputStream.skip(startPosition);\n        currentPosition = startPosition;\n        this.endPosition = endPosition;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public int read() throws IOException {\n        if (currentPosition >= endPosition) {\n            return -1; // EOF\n        }\n        int byteRead = fileInputStream.read();\n        currentPosition++;\n        return byteRead;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void close() throws IOException {\n        fileInputStream.close();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou can then use this ConstrainedInputStream to read only a certain range of bytes from a file. For example:\n\n```java\ntry (ConstrainedInputStream inputStream = new ConstrainedInputStream(\"path/to/file.txt\", 0, 100)) {\n    int byteRead;\n    while ((byteRead = inputStream.read()) != -1) {\n        // Process the byte\n    }\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the ConstrainedInputStream is created with a file path, start position (0), and end position (100). The read() method is overridden to check if the current position has reached the end position, and returns -1 (EOF) if it has. Otherwise, it reads the next byte from the file and increments the current position.\n\nNote that the ConstrainedInputStream extends InputStream, so it can be used wherever an InputStream is expected."
