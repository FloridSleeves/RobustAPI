In this class, you can maintain a variable to store the next even number and a method to find the next even number.\n\nIn the constructor, you initialize the original iterator and call the findNextEven() method to find the first even number.\n\nThe hasNext() method checks if the nextEven variable is not null, indicating that there is a next even number.\n\nThe next() method returns the current even number and calls the findNextEven() method to find the next even number.\n\nThe findNextEven() method iterates through the original iterator until it finds an even number. If an even number is found, it is stored in the nextEven variable and the loop is exited. If no even number is found, the nextEven variable remains null.\n\nBy using this custom iterator, you can iterate over the even numbers in the list without modifying the original list."

I am given an iterator for a list of integers. I need to write a function that returns takes this iterator as argument and returns the iterator for even numbers only. I was told, I cannot modify the original list of numbers. Hence, removing odd numbers from the list is not the solution. Please advise. Thanks.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
