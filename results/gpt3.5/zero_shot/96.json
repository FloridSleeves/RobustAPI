Call the write() method of the DataOutputStream to write the bytes to the client.\n3. After writing the bytes, call the flush() method to ensure that all the bytes are sent.\n4. Get the number of bytes written by calling the size() method of the underlying OutputStream.\n\nHere is an example code snippet:\n\n```java\nSocket client = new Socket(\"localhost\", 8080);\nOutputStream outputStream = client.getOutputStream();\nDataOutputStream dataOutputStream = new DataOutputStream(outputStream);\n\nbyte[] bytes = \"Hello, World!\".getBytes();\ndataOutputStream.write(bytes);\ndataOutputStream.flush();\n\nint bytesWritten = outputStream.size();\nSystem.out.println(\"Number of bytes written: \" + bytesWritten);\n\ndataOutputStream.close();\noutputStream.close();\nclient.close();\n```\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nTo get the number of bytes written by the DataOutputStream, you can use the size() method of the underlying OutputStream. This method returns the number of bytes written to the stream since it was created or the last time the size() method was called. By calling size() after writing the bytes, you can get the exact number of bytes written."

The server will send bytes to the client by calling DataOutputStream's write(bytes[] b), the DataOutputStream is wrapped around client.getOutputStream directly(no Buffer here).   This is a file download functionality And I'm going to support resume, I didn't use any HTTP here, I've implemented my own simple protocol.  I've seen these questions on SO :1-question1.2-C# question.3-FileChannel question.   The first doesn't answer my question, I can't wrap DataOutputStream around ByteArrayOutputStream because the latter can't be wrapped around client.getOutputStream and I don't know how to implement my own write(int i) method(And don't want to use JNI).   the second is C# not java(and it's calling WIN API anyway, I'm a linux user by the way :) ).   The third is talking about FileChannels and HTTP, As I said I'm not using HTTP and I'm using java Socket's API.  So how to get how many bytes were actually written ?PS (EDIT)By resume support I mean I'll give the client the ability to stop download at specific byte and then after a while(minutes,hours,days,whatever) he/she can resume download from where it has left.   \nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:"
