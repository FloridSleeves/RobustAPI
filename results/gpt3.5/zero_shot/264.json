We start by creating a HashMap called `lists` that contains all the ArrayLists.\n2. We create an iterator for the first ArrayList using `Iterator<Integer> iterator = lists.get(\"list1\").iterator();`.\n3. We create a HashSet called `commonNumbers` to store the common numbers.\n4. We iterate through the first ArrayList using `while (iterator.hasNext())` and `int number = iterator.next();`.\n5. For each number, we iterate through the other ArrayLists using a for-each loop and check if the number is present in each ArrayList using `currentList.contains(number)`.\n6. If the number is not present in any of the ArrayLists, we set `isCommon` to false and break out of the loop.\n7. If the number is common to all ArrayLists, we add it to the `commonNumbers` HashSet.\n8. Finally, we convert the HashSet to an ArrayList called `result` using `ArrayList<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>(commonNumbers)`.\n\nThis solution iterates through each ArrayList only once and uses the `contains()` method to check if a number is present in each ArrayList. It stores the common numbers in a HashSet to ensure uniqueness and then converts it to an ArrayList for the final result."

But I'll still post it just in case it is useful for someone else.But of course if you have a better way please do let me know.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
