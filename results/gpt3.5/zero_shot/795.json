By passing the FileWriter object with the \"true\" parameter to the PrintWriter constructor, it will open the file in append mode, allowing you to append data to the file if it already exists. The write method will write the specified string to the file. Finally, remember to close the PrintWriter after writing the data."

If the file doesn't exists, I want to create the file and then add the data.Adding data works fine. But appending data overwrites existing data. I followed the instructions of axtavt here (PrintWriter append method not appending).     String savestr = \"mysave.sav\";     File f = new File(savestr);    PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(savestr);    if ( f.exists() && !f.isDirectory() ) {        out = new PrintWriter(new FileOutputStream(new File(savestr), true));        out.append(mapstring);        out.close();    }    else {        out.println(mapstring);        out.close();    }where mapstring is the string I want to append. Can you help me? Thank you!\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
