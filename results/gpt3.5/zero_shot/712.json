In the code snippet provided, we create a PrintWriter object using the response.getWriter() method. We then use the write method to write each line of the vCard, appending \"\\r\\n\" at the end of each line to represent a carriage return. This will ensure that each line is separated by a CR."

I found out some platforms don't recognize these generated vCards unless their lines are separated by Carriage Returns (CR), and JSP seems to use just Line Feed (LF) by default to separate lines.Do you guys know any way to tell the JSP to include a CR between each line?I hope someone has a clue, cause I haven't found much out there...Thanks in advance!\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
