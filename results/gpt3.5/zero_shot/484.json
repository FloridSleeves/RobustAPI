This allows us to access each index one by one without having to use the .contains() method of HashSet. This approach should be faster as it avoids the overhead of checking for containment in a HashSet."

(I don't know if this makes a difference since as I mentioned in the other question my arrays are small -50 elements-). If this does not make a difference point it out though.I am not interested in the value per se, only the indices.My question is whether there is a faster approach to go with it?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
