If the writer is closed, you can handle the case accordingly.\n\nTo wait for the ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor to finish creating the file before starting to write, you can use a CountDownLatch. The latch is initially set to 1, and when the file creation is finished, it is counted down. The openFileWriter method waits for the latch to reach 0 before proceeding with creating the new file and writer."

(writer.close())How can i wait to the ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor to finish creating the file before start writing\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
