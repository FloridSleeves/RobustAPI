The LinkedList class in Java implements the List interface and provides constant time complexity for adding and removing elements at both ends of the list. Additionally, it provides a method called `Iterator.next()` which allows you to iterate over the elements in the collection. By using the `Iterator.next()` method, you can easily retrieve the next element in the list."

What collection would be good for fast add, get and removal of a random element?The items don't have to retain any kind of order.I'm developing a snake game and I'm keeping track of unoccupied cells in the game area (to be able to quickly pick a new place for the apple once it's eaten).Here \"fast\" can be O(log n) or O(1).\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
