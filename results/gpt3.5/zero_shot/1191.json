First, create a `StringTokenizer` object by passing the `CurrentString` and \":\" as parameters. Then, use the `nextToken()` method to get the first and second strings after splitting. Finally, use `setText()` method of the `TextView` to display the strings in separate `TextViews`."

I would like to split up the CurrentString using the : as the delimiter.So that way the word \"Fruit\" will be split into its own string and \"they taste good\" will be another string.And then i would simply like to use SetText() of 2 different TextViews to display that string. What would be the best way to approach this? \nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
