To solve this, you can directly write the line to the output file using the PrintWriter.write method inside the while loop. This way, each line will be written to the output file separately. Additionally, I have removed the unnecessary variables 's' and 'b' and moved the PrintWriter initialization outside the while loop to avoid opening and closing the file multiple times."

I'm trying to modify the text from testfile.txt and write it to a new file named mdemarco.txt. The modification I'm trying to do is add a line number in front of each line. Does anybody know a way to maybe write the contents of the while loop to a string while it runs and output the resulting string to mdemarco.txt or anything like that?public class Writefile{public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException{  try  {     Scanner file = new Scanner(new File(\"testfile.txt\"));     File output = new File(\"mdemarco.txt\");     String s = \"\";     String b = \"\";     int n = 0;     while(file.hasNext())     {        s = file.nextLine();        n++;        System.out.println(n+\". \"+s);        b = (n+\". \"+s);     }//end while     PrintWriter printer = new PrintWriter(output);     printer.println(b);     printer.close();  }//end try     catch(FileNotFoundException fnfe)  {     System.out.println(\"Was not able to locate testfile.txt.\");  }}//end main}//end classThe input file text is:doremefa solatedoAnd the output I'm getting is only8. doCan anybody help?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
