The command string is assumed to have the format \"command email address number\". The code first extracts the substring starting from index 7 to remove the \"command\" token. Then, it creates a new StringTokenizer object with the extracted substring. The email address is obtained by calling the nextToken() method on the StringTokenizer object, and the number is obtained by calling nextToken() again."

I dont care about the command token.My code looks like this:String test2 = command.substring(7);StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(test2);String email = st.nextToken();String amount = st.nextToken();\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
