In the application I am maintaining train time. From my database I can able to fetch times as String array list like this    train_schedule_time------>[8.2, 13.55, 0.45]Now I want to segregate my array by hour with corresponding minutes like this ...I am using StringTokenizer and split into hour array and minute array. But i can't able to group my hour with multiple minutes and I have to show in list view. How can i do this? Can anybody help me? Thank in advance\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
