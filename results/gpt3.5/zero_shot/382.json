This can cause a ConcurrentModificationException. To avoid this, you can use an Iterator to iterate over the ArrayList and remove elements safely.\n\nIn the updated code, an Iterator is created using the iterator() method of the ArrayList. The while loop is used to iterate over the elements using the hasNext() method of the Iterator. The next() method is used to get the next element in the iteration.\n\nInside the loop, the conditions are checked to determine if the item should be dropped in the current room or not. If the conditions are met, the item is added to the current room using currentRoom.addItem(item), and then removed from the ArrayList using iterator.remove(). The currentMessage is updated accordingly.\n\nIf the item is not found or the room already has an item, the currentMessage is updated accordingly."

Update the game\u2019s message with one of the following options: 1) the player is not holding that item, 2) the room already has an item, or 3) the player has successfully dropped the item in the room.  This is the goal of this method but when I run it it always skipps to the currentMessage in the else statement.PROBLEM:The problem I am hacing is that when I run this method and try to drop an Item in a room, it doesnt and skips to the else statement and resturns the message \"you do not have that item\", and I do not know why it is doing this and not working through the first if statement because I am typing an items name I know is in the arraylist.public void drop(String name){          for(Item count : myArray){        if(count.getName().contains(name) && currentRoom.hasItem() == false){            currentRoom.addItem(count);            currentMessage = \"you have successfully dropped the item in the room\";            myArray.remove(count);        }        else if(count.getName().contains(name) && currentRoom.hasItem() == true)        {            currentMessage = \"the room already has an item\";        }        else         {            currentMessage = \"you do not have that item\";        }    }}\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
