However, the issue is not with the `PrintWriter.write` method itself, but with the response encoding configuration.\n\nIn the provided code, the response encoding is set to UTF-8 using the following line:\n```\nresp.setCharacterEncoding(\"utf-8\");\n```\nHowever, the output shows that the response is being encoded as ISO-8859-1, which is likely the default encoding for the server.\n\nTo ensure that the response is correctly encoded as UTF-8, you can try the following steps:\n\n1. Remove the following line from the code:\n```\nresp.setLocale(Locale.TAIWAN);\n```\nSetting the locale is not necessary for changing the response encoding.\n\n2. Check the server configuration to ensure that it is configured to use UTF-8 encoding. This can typically be done in the server's configuration files or settings.\n\n3. If you are using a web.xml file, make sure that the `<locale-encoding-mapping>` element is correctly configured to map the desired locale (zh_TW) to UTF-8 encoding.\n\nBy ensuring that the server and application are configured to use UTF-8 encoding, the response should be correctly encoded as UTF-8 and the Chinese characters should be displayed correctly."
