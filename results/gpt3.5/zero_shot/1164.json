The code reads the TXT file line by line using a BufferedReader and stores each line in a List of Strings.\n2. The extractPlayers method uses StringTokenizer to split each line into tokens based on the space delimiter.\n3. The tokens are then used to create Player objects, which are added to a List of Players.\n4. The sortPlayers method sorts the List of Players based on the position using a custom Comparator.\n5. The printPlayers method prints each Player object in the sorted order.\n6. The Player class represents a player with various attributes and overrides the toString method to display the player information in the desired format.\n7. The main method calls the above methods in the required order to achieve the desired sorting and printing of player information."
