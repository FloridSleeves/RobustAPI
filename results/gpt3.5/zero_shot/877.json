We specify the columns we want to retrieve, including the columns from the \"clients\" table (id, name, last_name) and all columns from the \"grants\" table (using \"grants.*\" to select all columns).\n\nWe set the selection parameter to \"clients.id = 2\" to filter the results for the specific client with id = 2. The selectionArgs parameter is set to null since we don't have any arguments for the selection.\n\nThe groupBy, having, and orderBy parameters are set to null as we don't need any grouping, filtering, or ordering in this case.\n\nFinally, we execute the query using the db.query method and obtain a Cursor object that can be used to iterate over the result set."
