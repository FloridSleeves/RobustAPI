In this case, you need to use the \"GBK\" encoding.\n\nIn the given code, the string `name` is already in GBK encoding, so you don't need to convert it from UTF-8. You can directly get the bytes of the string using `name.getBytes(\"GBK\")`. Then, create a new string using the GBK bytes and specify the \"GBK\" encoding.\n\nFinally, you can print the converted GBK string using `System.out.println(gbkStr)`.\n\nMake sure that your Java environment supports the GBK encoding. If the output is still not correct, it could be due to incorrect encoding or character mapping issues."

But I do not know how to convert that name string into a readable GBK string (such as \u4e0a\u6d77 or \u5317\u4eac).I am usingString sname = new String(name.getBytes(), \"UTF-8\");byte[] gbkbytes = sname.getBytes(\"gb2312\");String gbkStr = new String( gbkbytes );System.out.println(gbkStr);but it's not printed right in GBK text???\u00a1\u00ec??:????12I have no clue how to proceed.\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:"
