In the code above, we create an instance of `Random` and use the `nextInt()` method to generate random numbers between 1 and 100 (inclusive). We then use a `while` loop to check if any of the numbers match, and if they do, we generate new random numbers until they are all unique. Finally, we assign the generated numbers to the `num1`, `num2`, and `num3` variables. This code can be placed in the `onCreate()` method of your activity class."

I was able to do the random number using the math.rand() but I am trying to make sure that the three numbers do not match. I did a work around using while and if statements, but I was looking to see if there is a one line of command to do this, so that I can put it right under th activity class so that it's public var. and in that area (activity) I can't use while and if statements, I only can in onCreate due to the void or something. Thank you in advance for your help, and will vote for any help or idea that will lead to finding any info about this. \nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer:"
