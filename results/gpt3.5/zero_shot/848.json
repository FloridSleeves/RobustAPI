It opens the file in read mode, seeks to the desired start position (3MB in this case), reads the specified segment size (1MB in this case), and stores the segment in a byte array. You can then use the segment as needed, such as converting it to an InputStream or File object."

I'd like to take advantage of this feature.Here's the scenario.File FOO.BAR is 20 MB.  I'd split it into some arbitrary chunk size, let's say 1 MB, which means 20 chunks.   Chunks #3 and #14 fail (maybe the cellular/WiFi connection was bad).  I can now re-upload just these two chunks and everything will be good.What I'd like to know is how can I read only part of a file (like the data between 3MB and 4MB)?  The file piece should be an InputStream or File object.Thanks,Makoto\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:"
