In this case, the code is trying to create a PrintWriter object with a File object, which can throw a FileNotFoundException if the file cannot be found or accessed.\n\nTo fix this error, you need to either catch the exception using a try-catch block or declare that the method can throw the exception. In the provided code, a try-catch block is added to catch the FileNotFoundException and handle it appropriately. The code inside the try block attempts to create a PrintWriter object and write the string \"hello\" to the file. If a FileNotFoundException occurs, the catch block will be executed and the exception will be printed.\n\nUsing the PrintWriter.write method, the code writes the string \"hello\" to the file instead of using the println method."

(1 answer)                            Closed last year.I'm trying to create a simple program that will output a string to a text file. Using code I found here, I have put together the following code: import java.io.*;public class Testing {  public static void main(String[] args) {    File file = new File (\"file.txt\");    file.getParentFile().mkdirs();    PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(file);    printWriter.println (\"hello\");    printWriter.close();         }} J-grasp throws me the following error:  ----jGRASP exec: javac -g Testing.javaTesting.java:10: error: unreported exception FileNotFoundException; must be caught or declared to be thrown    PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(file);                              ^1 error ----jGRASP wedge2: exit code for process is 1.Since I'm pretty new to Java, I have no idea what this means. Can anybody point me in the right direction? \nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
