It is a common practice to provide access to the elements of a private collection through an iterator.\n\n<<<explanation>>>: Encapsulation is the principle of hiding the internal implementation details of a class and providing controlled access to its data. In this case, by returning an iterator of the private List, you are not exposing the internal implementation of the Zoo class. The iterator allows external code to iterate over the elements of the animalList without directly accessing or modifying the list itself.\n\nBy returning an iterator, you are providing a controlled way to access the elements of the animalList. This allows you to maintain encapsulation while still providing access to the animals in the Zoo class. It also avoids the need for defining explicit getters and setters for the animalList.\n\nOverall, returning an iterator of a private List in the Zoo class is a good practice as it allows controlled access to the elements of the list without breaking encapsulation."

Reason why I want to return iterator is to avoid defining setters and getters and removal methods. Does that break encapsulation?class Zoo{    private List<Animal> animalList;    public Zoo(){        animalList = new ArrayList<Animal>();    }    public void addAnimal(Animal animal){        animalList.add(animal);    }    public Iterator<Animal> iterator(){        return animalList.iterator();    }}class Animal{    private String name;    private double weight, height;    Animal(String name, double weight, double height){        this.name = name;        this.weight = weight;        this.height = height;    }}\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
