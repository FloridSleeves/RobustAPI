To work around this, you can create an array of type `Object` and then cast it to type `T[]`. \n\nIn the code provided, I have modified the `c.toArray()` line to create an array of type `Object[]` using `new Object[c.size()]`. Then, I have used an iterator to iterate over the collection `c` and populate the array `a` with the elements. Finally, the rest of the code remains the same.\n\nNote that casting an array from `Object[]` to `T[]` may cause a warning, but it is safe in this case because we know that the elements in the collection `c` are of type `T`."

From what I understand this results from not specifying the type of objects in my collection. I'm currently working with int's for testing purposes, but the program is supposed to allow for sorting of any type object. I don't think I want to specify my collections as int's, and my collection is currently of type T for this reason. But my instructions explicitly state that my program should not generate any warnings. Here is one of my methods:What I have now:     else {        T[] a = new T[c.size()];        c.toArray(T[] a);        T min = a[0];        for (int i = 0; i < a.size(); i++) {           if (comp.compare(min, a[i]) > 0) {              min = a[i];           }        }        return min;      }What I'm getting:    Testing.java:48: error: generic array creation            T[] a = c.toArray(new T[c.size()]);\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
