To resolve this issue, you can use the wrapper class Long to convert the object to a long. Here's the updated code:\n\nlong a = ((Long) itr.next()).longValue();\n\nThis code first casts the object returned by next() to a Long object, and then uses the longValue() method to convert it to a long primitive type."

The type value is long. I am getting values using .values(). Now I want to access these values. Collection val = table.values();Iterator itr = val.iterator();long a  =   (long)itr.next();But when I try to get it, it gives me error because I can't convert from type object to long. How can I go around it?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
