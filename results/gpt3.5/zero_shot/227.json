To do this, you can iterate over the 2D array and store each char value in the corresponding index of the byte array. Then, you can send the byte array using the OutputStream's write() method.\n\nOn the receiving side, you can read the bytes into a byte array using the InputStream's read() method. After receiving the bytes, you can convert the byte array back to a 2D char array by iterating over the byte array and casting each byte value to a char.\n\nNote that the code provided assumes a 3x3 tic-tac-toe board, but you can adjust the dimensions accordingly for your specific game."

I have the \"board\" stored as a 2 dimensional char array. I want to be able to send and receive this array through Sockets. I am currently using a InputStream and OutputStream to send single bytes. However, I don't think this will work for sending the array. Also, these streams only seem capable of sending int type data. Can someone please explain to me how too send 2 dimensional char arrays over sockets using I/O streams. Example code would be great! Thanks. Current Code:public void communicate() {    try {        OutputStream os = client.getOutputStream();        InputStream is = client.getInputStream();    }    while (gameOver == false) {        char[][] board = new char[3][3];        try {            os.write(board); //this dosen't work, only sends non-array int types.         } catch (IOException e) {            e.printStackTrace();        }    }}\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
