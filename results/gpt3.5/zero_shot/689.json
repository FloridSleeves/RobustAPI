To redirect the output of the command to a file, you can use a PrintWriter object to write the output to the file manually. The updated code reads the output of the command using a BufferedReader and writes each line to the file using a PrintWriter. Finally, the PrintWriter is closed to ensure that all the data is written to the file."
