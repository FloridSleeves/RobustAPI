In some clearly identified cases, the map only contains one key-value pair, effectively only being a wrapper for the two objects.Is there an efficient / elegant / clear way to access both the key and the value? It seems overkill to iterate over the one-element entry set. I'm looking for somehing that would lower the brain power required for people who will maintain this, along the lines of:(...)// Only one result.else {    A leKey = map.getKey(whicheverYouWantThereIsOnlyOne); // Is there something like this?    B leValue = map.get(leKey); // This actually exists. Any Daft Punk reference was non-intentional.}Edit: I ended up going with @akoskm solution's below. In the end, the only satisfying way of doing this without iteration was with a TreeMap, and the overhead made that unreasonable. It turns out there is not always a silver bullet, especially as this would be a very small rabbit to kill with it.\nPlease using this api: SortedMap.firstKey.\nAnswer:"
