If any element is different, you can conclude that the ArrayLists are not the same.\n\nHere's an example code snippet:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.Iterator;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        ArrayList<Integer> list1 = new ArrayList<>();\n        list1.add(1);\n        list1.add(2);\n        list1.add(3);\n\n        ArrayList<Integer> list2 = new ArrayList<>();\n        list2.add(1);\n        list2.add(2);\n        list2.add(4);\n\n        boolean areDifferent = false;\n\n        Iterator<Integer> iterator1 = list1.iterator();\n        Iterator<Integer> iterator2 = list2.iterator();\n\n        while (iterator1.hasNext() && iterator2.hasNext()) {\n            if (!iterator1.next().equals(iterator2.next())) {\n                areDifferent = true;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n\n        if (areDifferent || iterator1.hasNext() || iterator2.hasNext()) {\n            System.out.println(\"The ArrayLists are different.\");\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"The ArrayLists are the same.\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nIn the code snippet above, we have two ArrayLists `list1` and `list2`. We create two iterators `iterator1` and `iterator2` for each ArrayList. We then iterate over both ArrayLists simultaneously using the `hasNext()` and `next()` methods of the iterators.\n\nInside the loop, we compare the elements using the `equals()` method. If any element is different, we set the `areDifferent` flag to true and break out of the loop.\n\nAfter the loop, we check if there are any remaining elements in either ArrayList using `hasNext()`. If there are, it means the ArrayLists have different sizes and are considered different.\n\nFinally, we print the appropriate message based on the value of the `areDifferent` flag and the remaining elements in the ArrayLists.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the elements in the ArrayLists have implemented the `equals()` method correctly. If you have a custom class as the elements, you may need to override the `equals()` method in that class to define the equality criteria."

I don't care what's the difference, I just want to know if they're not the same.I'm fetching scores list from a database every minute, and only if the scores list that I fetched is different from the one I fetched a minute ago I want to send it to the client.Now the value of the ArrayList is actually a class that I created (that contains name, lvl, rank, score).Do I need to implement equals() on it?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
