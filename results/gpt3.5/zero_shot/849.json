In this example, we use a buffer of size 1024 bytes and read from the GZIPInputStream until the end of the stream is reached. The bytesRead variable stores the number of bytes read in each iteration, and the uncompressedSize variable is incremented by this value. Finally, the method returns the total uncompressed size."

I want to know the original (uncompressed) length for the gzip data. Although I can read to the end of the GZIPInputStream, then count the number, it will cost much time and waste CPU. I would like to know the size before read it.Is there a similiar method like ZipEntry.getSize() for GZIPInputStream:public long getSize ()Since: API Level 1  Gets the uncompressed size of this ZipEntry.\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:"
