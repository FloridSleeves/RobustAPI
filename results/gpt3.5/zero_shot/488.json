Here's an example:\n\nIterator<T> iterator = collection.iterator();\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\n    T item = iterator.next();\n    // Process the item\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nThe Iterator.next method returns the next element in the collection and advances the iterator. By calling hasNext before each iteration, you can lazily load the elements one by one as needed. This allows you to avoid loading the entire collection into memory at once, which can be more efficient for large collections."

However, when I do lazy loading in Java/Hibernate. What is the recommended way to iterate over the collection using lazy loading and something similar to yield return ?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
