This method reads a single byte of data from the input stream and returns it as an integer value.\n\nIn the provided code, we initialize an InputStream object (you need to replace the comment with your actual input stream initialization). We then create a StringBuilder object called \"line\" to store the characters read until the new line.\n\nWe enter a while loop that continues until the end of the input stream is reached (indicated by the read() method returning -1). Inside the loop, we read a single byte from the input stream using inputStream.read() and store it in the \"character\" variable.\n\nWe check if the character is equal to '\\n' (new line). If it is, we break out of the loop since we have reached the end of the line. Otherwise, we append the character to the \"line\" StringBuilder object.\n\nFinally, we convert the \"line\" StringBuilder object to a String using the toString() method and store it in the \"lineString\" variable. This variable will contain the characters read until the new line.\n\nNote: This code assumes that the input stream contains text data. If the input stream contains binary data, you may need to handle the character encoding appropriately."
