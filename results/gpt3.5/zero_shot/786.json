Then, we create a `Scanner` object to read the contents of the original file. We also create a `PrintWriter` object to write the data to the new file.\n\nInside a loop, we read each line from the original file using `scanner.nextLine()` and write it to the new file using `writer.write(line)`. We also add a newline character after each line using `writer.write(\"\\n\")`.\n\nAfter the loop, we close both the `writer` and `scanner` objects to ensure that the data is written and the resources are released properly.\n\nFinally, we print a success message to indicate that the data transfer was successful."

In my main method I read in the file and closed the file. I call another method that created a new file inside of the same folder of the original file. So now I have two files, the original file and the file that is being made from the method that I call. I need another method that takes the data from the original file and writes it to the new file that is created. How do I do that?import java.io.*;import java.util.Scanner;import java.util.*;import java.lang.*;public class alice {    public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException {        String filename = (\"/Users/DAndre/Desktop/Alice/wonder1.txt\");        File textFile = new File(filename);        Scanner in = new Scanner(textFile);        in.close();        newFile();    }    public static void newFile() {        final Formatter x;        try {            x = new Formatter(\"/Users/DAndre/Desktop/Alice/new1.text\");            System.out.println(\"you created a new file\");        } catch (Exception e) {            System.out.println(\"Did not work\");        }    }    private static void newData() {    }}\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
