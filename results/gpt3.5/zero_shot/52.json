This method reads a line of text from the input stream and returns it as a String. \n\nIn the provided code, we create a `BufferedReader` object by passing a `FileReader` object that represents the text file we want to read. We then use a `while` loop to read each line of the file until there are no more lines (`line = reader.readLine()`). \n\nInside the loop, we check the content of each line using `if` statements. If the line matches a specific method name, we execute the corresponding method. You can replace `methodName1()`, `methodName2()`, and `methodName3()` with the actual method names you have in your Main program. \n\nRemember to handle any potential `IOException` that may occur when reading the file by using a `try-catch` block. Finally, we close the `BufferedReader` to release any system resources it may have acquired."

I have the saved files set up so that on every line there is the name of a method in my Main program. What I need to do is to look in a certain line for text and execute the method that the text is referring to.\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:"
