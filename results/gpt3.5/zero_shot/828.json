In the given code, we first create three `File` objects for the input, output, and error files. Then, we create a `Scanner` object to read from the input file, and `PrintWriter` objects to write to the output and error files.\n\nInside the `while` loop, we read each integer from the input file using `scanner.nextInt()` and write it to the output file using `outputWriter.println(number)`. If any exception occurs during the execution of the code, it will be caught by the `catch` block and the exception stack trace will be printed using `e.printStackTrace()`.\n\nFinally, we close the `Scanner` and `PrintWriter` objects to release any system resources they were using."

(JAVA): :I am supposed to Use Scanner to read int values from a file \u201cinput.txt\u201d, Read until end of file is reached, Write all program output to a file \u201coutput.txt\u201d, Write all exceptions to a file \u201cerror.txt\u201d, and Output each number read.I understand exceptions for the most part, but I do not understand how to write all exceptions to a text file in Java...\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
