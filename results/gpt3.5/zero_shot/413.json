It creates an iterator for the input list and then iterates over it using a `while` loop. Inside the loop, it creates a new sublist and adds elements to it using the `Iterator.next` method until either `n` elements have been added or there are no more elements in the input list. The sublist is then added to the `dividedLists` list. Finally, the method returns the `dividedLists` list containing the smaller lists. This approach avoids unnecessary array copying and provides a more efficient way to divide the list compared to the previous implementation."

Any pseudocode will do.    for (int i = 1; i <= Math.floor((A.size() / n)); i++) {            ArrayList temp = subArray(A, ((i * n) - n),                    (i * n) - 1);            // do stuff with temp        }    private ArrayList<Comparable> subArray(ArrayList A, int start,                int end) {            ArrayList toReturn = new ArrayList();            for (int i = start; i <= end; i++) {                toReturn.add(A.get(i));            }            return toReturn;        }where A is the list and n is the size of the desired listsI believe this way is taking too much time when working with considerably large lists of up to 1 million in size, so I'm trying to figure out what would be more efficient.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
