Value should be the next element in the collection and it should iterate until the collection is fully read through. public <T> T min(Collection<T> c, Comparator<T> comp) {if ((c == null) || (comp == null)) {     throw new IllegalArgumentException();  }  if (c.isEmpty() == true) {     throw new NoSuchElementException();  }  Iterator itr = c.iterator();   T min = (T)itr.next();  T value = ;  while (itr.hasNext()) {        if (comp.compare(min, value) < 0) {         min = value;       }  }  return min;}\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
