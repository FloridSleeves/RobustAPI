We first obtain the PrintWriter object from the response object using response.getWriter(). Then, we use the write method to write the desired text string (\"Hello all!\") to the response. Finally, we flush the writer to ensure that all the data is sent and close it to release any resources associated with it. This approach can be used as an alternative to the deprecated StringBufferInputStream class."
