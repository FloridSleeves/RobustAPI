In your case, you can create a List in your MainActivity class and store the result in it. Then, in your ViewPager class, you can retrieve the result from the List using the List.get() method. Here is an example code snippet:\n\nIn MainActivity.java:\n```\nList<YourClass> resultList = new ArrayList<>();\n\n// Start the second activity\nIntent intent = new Intent(MainActivity.this, SecondActivity.class);\nstartActivityForResult(intent, 1);\n\n// Receive the result from the second activity\n@Override\nprotected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\n    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);\n    if (requestCode == 1 && resultCode == RESULT_OK) {\n        YourClass result = data.getParcelableExtra(\"result\");\n        resultList.add(result);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn ViewPager.java:\n```\n// Retrieve the result from the MainActivity\nYourClass result = resultList.get(index);\n```\n\nNote: Make sure to replace \"YourClass\" with the actual class name you are using for the result."
