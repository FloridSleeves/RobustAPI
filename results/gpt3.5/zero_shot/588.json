In the given code, a List of Strings is created and three elements are added to it. The `list.get(1)` statement retrieves the element at index 1 (which is \"banana\") and assigns it to the `element` variable. Finally, the element is printed to the console."

Both belong to the Java Collections framework and provide a sorted way to access the elements. However, in my understanding there is no SortedList in Java. You can use java.util.Collections.sort() to sort a list.Any idea why it is designed like that?\nPlease using this api: List.get.\nAnswer:"
