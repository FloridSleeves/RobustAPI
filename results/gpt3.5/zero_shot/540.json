This method checks the type of the numbers and performs the addition accordingly. \n\nIn the \"sum\" method, you can use an iterator to iterate over the elements in the iterable. For each element, you can call the \"add\" method to add it to the result. The result is initialized as null and updated with each iteration. At the end, the final result is returned.\n\nNote that the \"add\" method uses type casting to return the result as the generic type T. This may cause a warning, but it is safe in this case because the method only handles numbers that extend the Number class."

Because you can't have two methods with the same signature (Our compiler thinks Integer sum(Iterable<Integer>) has the same signature as Double sum(Iterable<Double>).) I tried to write one method with generics.private static <T extends Number> T sum(Iterable<? extends T> it) {    T result;    for(T next : it) {        result += next;    }    return result;}However this method will not compile (reason: the operator += is undefined for Object, Object). What can I do here? I know in C++ you can overload operators, but not in Java. But every class which extends Number does overload the += operator. What can I do here?Thank you in advance.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
