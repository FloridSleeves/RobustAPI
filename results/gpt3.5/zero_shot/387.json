This method takes an integer parameter called limit, which represents the maximum number of activities to retrieve.\n\nInside the method, you create an empty ArrayList called latestActivities to store the latest activities. Then, you create an iterator from the activities list using the iterator() method. \n\nYou also create a count variable and set it to 0. This variable will keep track of the number of activities added to the latestActivities list.\n\nNext, you use a while loop to iterate through the activities using the iterator. The loop continues as long as there are more activities in the list and the count is less than the limit.\n\nInside the loop, you add the next activity from the iterator to the latestActivities list using the next() method. Then, you increment the count variable.\n\nFinally, you return the latestActivities list, which will contain the most recent activities up to the specified limit."

Is it possible to automatically do it during any fetch from DB? (so that I don't have to limit the collection by hand in Java).@Entitypublic class Person {    @Id    @GeneratedValue    private Long id;    @OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL, fetch = FetchType.EAGER)    @OrderBy(\"timestamp DESC\")    @JoinColumn(name = \"PERSON_ID\")    private List<Activity> activities;    // other setters, getters, etc. }Essentially I'd like to keep, say, 20 entries in the ACTIVITY entries (dropping the oldest rows, when newer are inserted), but fetch only 5 latest. Is this possible?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
