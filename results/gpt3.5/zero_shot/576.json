The iterator is obtained by calling the `iterator()` method on the `collection` object. The `iterator()` method returns an iterator object that allows us to traverse the elements of the queue.\n\nThe `hasNext()` method of the iterator checks if there are more elements in the queue. If there are more elements, the loop continues. The `next()` method of the iterator returns the next element in the queue and assigns it to the variable `t`. Finally, we print the value of `t` using `StdOut.println(t)`.\n\nSo, in summary, the code iterates through the elements of the queue using an iterator and prints each element."

Correct? Then the second bit of code is what confuses me. We are looping to print whats in the queue but i'm not sure i understand how this works. collection points to the Queue of type Transaction. It looks like we are creating a reference t to the object Transaction and doing something with it to the reference collection. Pretty confused.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
