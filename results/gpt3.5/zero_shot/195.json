After determining the size of the binary content, you can create a byte array with the specified size. Then, you can use a while loop to read the binary content from the stream into the byte array. The loop continues until the number of bytes read is equal to the size of the binary content. This ensures that all the binary content is read from the stream. If the end of the file is reached before reading all the bytes, an IOException is thrown."

The size of the binary content is determined by some one of the plain text lines I read.I was using a BufferedReader to read the individual lines, however it exposes no methods to refer to read a byte array. The readUTF for a DataInputStream doesnt read all the way to the end of the line, and the readLine method is deprecated.Using the underlying FileInputStream to read returns empty byte arrays. Any suggestions on how to go about this?private DOTDataInfo parseFile(InputStream stream) throws IOException{DOTDataInfo info = new DOTDataInfo();BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(stream));int binSize = 0;String line;while((line = reader.readLine()) != null){    if(line.length() == 0)        break;    DOTProperty prop = parseProperty(line);    info.getProperties().add(prop);    if(prop.getName().equals(\"ContentSize\"))        binSize = Integer.parseInt(prop.getValue());}byte[] content = new byte[binSize];stream.read(content); //Its all empty now. If I use a DataInputStream instead, its got the values from the filereturn info;}\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
