The `Iterator` interface provides a method called `next()` which returns the next element in the iteration. By iterating through the collection until there are no more elements, we can obtain the last element.\n\nIn the code snippet provided, we first obtain an iterator for the collection using `collection.iterator()`. We then initialize a variable `lastElement` to store the last element. We iterate through the collection using a `while` loop and assign each element to `lastElement` until there are no more elements. Finally, we return `lastElement`.\n\nThis approach is straightforward and does not require converting the collection to an array. It is also efficient as it only iterates through the collection once."
