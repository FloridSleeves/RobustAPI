Here is the modified code:\n\nPrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"hello.txt\", \"UTF-8\");\nint index = line.indexOf(\"\\r\\n09/19/14\");\nif (index != -1) {\n    writer.write(line.substring(0, index));\n}\nwriter.close();\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The code first finds the index of the substring \"\\r\\n09/19/14\" using the indexOf() function. If the substring is found, it writes the substring from the start of the line to the index to the file using the write() function. Finally, it closes the PrintWriter. This way, only the desired substring will be written to the file."

Now I'm using the .split() function to try separate the tweets from one another but it would seem that \\r\\n09/19/14 isn't an appropriate split string? Here is the code:String[] value = line.split(\"\\r\\n09/19/14\");PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"hello.txt\", \"UTF-8\");writer.println(value[0]);writer.close();The text file 'hello', when I open it is just the following string again, \"TweetJSONObject\\r\\n09/19/14TweetJSONObject\". Any ideas as to where I'm going wrong?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
