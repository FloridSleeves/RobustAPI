This is not allowed and results in a ConcurrentModificationException.\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The ConcurrentModificationException is thrown when a collection is modified while it is being iterated over. In this case, the code is modifying the Map by removing elements while iterating over its keySet. This is not allowed and results in the exception.\n\nTo fix this issue, you can use the Iterator provided by the keySet() method to iterate over the keySet and remove elements using the Iterator's remove() method. Here's an updated version of the code:\n\npublic void remove(Map<String, User> removeUser) {\n    Set<String> keySet = removeUser.keySet();\n    User user = null;\n    Iterator<String> iterator = keySet.iterator();\n    while (iterator.hasNext()) {\n        String key = iterator.next();\n        user = removeUser.get(key);\n        if (!user.isActive()) {\n            iterator.remove();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nBy using the Iterator's remove() method, you can safely remove elements from the Map while iterating over its keySet without encountering a ConcurrentModificationException."

As per the requirement I need to iterate over the keySet of the Map and remove objects which dont need any modification.Conside the code below: public void remove(Map<String,User> removeUser){  Set<String> keySet = removeUser.keySey();  User user = null;  for(String key : keySet){      user = (user) removeUser.get(key);       if(!user.isActive()){                removeUser.remove(key);       }  } }Here in above code, I am getting ConcurrentModificationException when I try to fetch User object after Object removal.Can anyone tell me why it's happening?I have not used multi threading.So not able to understand, from where it generated ConCurrentModification Exception.Even I tried with HashMap and Hashtable, but the problem still exist.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
