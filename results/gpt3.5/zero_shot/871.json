Create a Singleton class for your SQLiteOpenHelper. This class will ensure that only one instance of the helper is created and shared among the activities.\n\n```java\npublic class DatabaseHelper extends SQLiteOpenHelper {\n    private static DatabaseHelper instance;\n\n    private DatabaseHelper(Context context) {\n        super(context, DATABASE_NAME, null, DATABASE_VERSION);\n    }\n\n    public static synchronized DatabaseHelper getInstance(Context context) {\n        if (instance == null) {\n            instance = new DatabaseHelper(context.getApplicationContext());\n        }\n        return instance;\n    }\n\n    // Rest of the SQLiteOpenHelper implementation\n}\n```\n\n2. In each activity, obtain an instance of the DatabaseHelper using the getInstance() method.\n\n```java\nDatabaseHelper dbHelper = DatabaseHelper.getInstance(this);\nSQLiteDatabase db = dbHelper.getWritableDatabase();\n```\n\n3. Use the SQLiteDatabase object to perform database operations, such as querying using the SQLiteDatabase.query() method.\n\n```java\nCursor cursor = db.query(TABLE_NAME, null, null, null, null, null, null);\n```\n\n4. After you have finished using the database, close the SQLiteDatabase object.\n\n```java\ndb.close();\n```\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nBy creating a Singleton class for your SQLiteOpenHelper, you ensure that only one instance of the helper is created and shared among the activities. This helps in maintaining a single connection to the database throughout the application.\n\nIn each activity, you can obtain an instance of the DatabaseHelper using the getInstance() method. This method checks if an instance already exists and creates a new one if necessary. This way, you can access the same database instance from multiple activities.\n\nAfter you have finished using the database, it is important to close the SQLiteDatabase object to release any resources associated with it. You can call the close() method once you are done with all the database operations in an activity."

Two activities must save some informations so I use in both a MySQLiteHelper to access the database.I read here that building SQLiteOpenHelper as static data member could be a good practice so I did this. The static factory method ensures that there exists only one DatabaseHelper instance at any time.I create in each activity a SQLiteOpenHelper that uses the method getWritableDatabase() but I don't know where to use the close() method. Should I put this method after every modification or once at the end of the activity ? Thank you =)\nPlease using this api: SQLiteDatabase.query.\nAnswer:"
