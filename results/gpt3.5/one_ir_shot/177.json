In this case, you can create a FileInputStream to read the binary file, specify the buffer size as the size of the struct, and use the read() method to read the bytes into the buffer. You can then process the buffer as needed. Note that this approach assumes that the binary file was written in a compatible format, with the same padding and alignment rules as the C compiler used."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Replicating C struct padding in Java: :According to here, the C compiler will pad out values when writing a structure to a binary file. As the example in the link says, when writing a struct like this:struct { char c; int i;} a;to a binary file, the compiler will usually leave an unnamed, unused hole between the char and int fields, to ensure that the int field is properly aligned. How could I to create an exact replica of the binary output file (generated in C), using a different language (in my case, Java)?Is there an automatic way to apply C padding in Java output? Or do I have to go through compiler documentation to see how it works (the compiler is g++ by the way).\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
