You can use the getInstalledApplications() method to get a list of all installed applications. Then, you can iterate over the list and retrieve the package name for each application. Finally, you can implement your own logic to get the execution count for each package name. This can be done using SharedPreferences or any other method of your choice to store and retrieve the execution count."

I am trying to find the value how many times were the already installed packages executed (closed and open). I am aware i can do that for my application from sharepreferences but how to do for packages that are already there?
