I really can't understand what is wroong. I have this premission in my manifest:<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\" />Can someone give me a clue? I know that I'm missing something small, but I really can't spot it.Here is how I write the file:/* Write content to a file */    private void writeToFile(ArrayList<String> list, Context cont) {        File file = new File(\"jokesBody1.bjk\");             FileOutputStream fos;        if(list != null){        try {                           fos = cont.openFileOutput(\"jokesBody1.bjk\", Context.MODE_PRIVATE);                ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(fos);                out.writeObject(list);                out.close();        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {                e.printStackTrace();        } catch (IOException e) {                e.printStackTrace();         }        }else{            try {                file.createNewFile();                fos = openFileOutput(\"jokesBody1.bjk\",Context.MODE_PRIVATE);                ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(fos);                out.writeObject(\"\");                out.close();        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {                e.printStackTrace();        } catch (IOException e) {                e.printStackTrace();         }        }    }\nPlease using this api: File.createNewFile.\nAnswer:"
