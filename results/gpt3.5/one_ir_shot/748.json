In this case, the code is trying to create a PrintWriter object with a File object, which can throw a FileNotFoundException if the file cannot be found or accessed. To fix this error, you need to either catch the exception using a try-catch block or declare that the method throws the exception. In the provided code, a try-catch block is used to catch the FileNotFoundException and handle it by printing the stack trace."

(1 answer)                            Closed last year.I'm trying to create a simple program that will output a string to a text file. Using code I found here, I have put together the following code: import java.io.*;public class Testing {  public static void main(String[] args) {    File file = new File (\"file.txt\");    file.getParentFile().mkdirs();    PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(file);    printWriter.println (\"hello\");    printWriter.close();         }} J-grasp throws me the following error:  ----jGRASP exec: javac -g Testing.javaTesting.java:10: error: unreported exception FileNotFoundException; must be caught or declared to be thrown    PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(file);                              ^1 error ----jGRASP wedge2: exit code for process is 1.Since I'm pretty new to Java, I have no idea what this means. Can anybody point me in the right direction? \nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
