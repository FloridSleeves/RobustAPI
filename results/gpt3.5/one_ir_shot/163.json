Client will keep streaming data requests to my server app through the socket. Request is a POST with a binary payload which needs to be copied to a byte array which i need to use to get the protocol buffer class.POST / HTTP/1.1Host: 127.0.0.1:80Accept-Encoding: identityContent-Length: 423Content-type: application/octet-stream[PAYLOAD]val out = new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream())val in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()))Any ideas ? UPDATE - I got a temporary solution using a DEPRECATED java function - DataInputStream.readLine.Can someone make this code better ?val in = new DataInputStream(socket.getInputStream())var n:Int = 0var size:Int=0while (n==0) {    var str=in.readLine    if(str==\"\"){        n =1    }else{        val breaks=str.split(\" \")        if(breaks(0).equals(\"Content-Length:\"))size=breaks(1).toInt    }}var payload:Array[Byte]=new Array(size)n=size-1for(i <- 0 to n) payload(i)=in.readByte\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
