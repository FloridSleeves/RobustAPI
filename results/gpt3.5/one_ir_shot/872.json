It takes several parameters including the table name, projection (columns to include in the result), selection (the WHERE clause), selectionArgs (values for the selection), and additional parameters for sorting and grouping. In this case, we are querying for rows with a specific group_id by setting the selection to \"word_group_id = ?\" and passing the group_id as a selection argument. The result is returned as a Cursor object, which we can iterate over to create WordContainer objects."

It is not currently accepting answers.                                                            Want to improve this question? Update the question so it focuses on one problem only by editing this post.Closed 9 years ago.                        Improve this question                    I have a database with two tables , First one contains 2 columns: group_ID , group_name . And the second one : ID, Word, Definition , word_group_id . This is the prototype of the function which I am going to write WordContainer [] findWordsByGroupId(int id);and this is the WordContainer class:public class WordContainer {      String word;      String definition;      int id  = -1;public WordContainer (int id , String word ,String definition){    this.id = id;    this.word = word;    this.definition = definition;}public void setWord (String word){    this.word = word;}public void setDefinition (String definition){    this.definition = definition;}public String getWord (){    return this.word;}public String getDefinition (){    return this.definition;}}So the question is , How to write a SQLite query which will find all the rows (or ids of those rows)which have the given group_id ; \nPlease using this api: SQLiteDatabase.query.\nAnswer:"
