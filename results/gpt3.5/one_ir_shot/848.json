The seek() method is used to set the file pointer to the desired position, and the read() method is used to read the specified number of bytes into a byte array."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Read a segment of a file in Java / Android: :I'm sure this might be a simple question, but unfortunately this is my first time using Java and working the Android SDK.I am uploading files on Android using the Apache HTTP libraries, in particular using the MultipartEntity.I'm uploading to a service that allows me to send them chunks of the file, and once complete, they'll reassemble the chunks.  I'd like to take advantage of this feature.Here's the scenario.File FOO.BAR is 20 MB.  I'd split it into some arbitrary chunk size, let's say 1 MB, which means 20 chunks.   Chunks #3 and #14 fail (maybe the cellular/WiFi connection was bad).  I can now re-upload just these two chunks and everything will be good.What I'd like to know is how can I read only part of a file (like the data between 3MB and 4MB)?  The file piece should be an InputStream or File object.Thanks,Makoto\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:"
