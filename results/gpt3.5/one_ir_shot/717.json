The flush() method flushes the stream, meaning that any buffered output is written to the underlying stream. In the case of a servlet response, calling flush() will send the response to the client. So, when you call out.flush(), the response is committed and flushed to the client."

This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: when is servlet response committed or flushed?: :According to javadoc:in-request.getRequestDispatcher(\"/Test\").forward(request,response);forward should be called before the response has been committed to the  client (before response body output has been flushed).Uncommitted output in the response buffer is automatically cleared before the forward.I am getting confused when this response is committed or been flushed?is this writing in println of printwriter.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
