However, now I want to switch from using the split method to another second scanner class to read each sentence to each word.import java.util.Scanner;import java.io.FileNotFoundException;import java.io.File;import java.io.PrintWriter;public class ScannerDemo{     public static void main(String args[]) {        String c = \"\";        try{            File file = new File(args[0]);            Scanner scanner = new Scanner(file);            PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(args[1]);         // as long as the scanner reads that the file has a next line               while (scanner.hasNextLine()) {        // read the first line of string in scanner s2                   Scanner s2 = new Scanner(scanner.nextLine());        // read the first word of first line from s2 as string \"counts\"                   String counts = s2.next();        // parse the string \"counts\" as int, \"count\"                   int count = Integer.parseInt(counts);        // as long as s2 has the next element                   while (s2.hasNext()){        // for loop executed \"count\" number of times to skip the words                       for (int x = 0; x < count; x ++){                           String b = s2.next();                        }       // else add the next words to string, \"c\"                           c += s2.next();                           c += \" \";                        }                    }        // close the scanner            scanner.close();        // output string \"c\" to the output file            writer.println(c);        // close the writer            writer.close();        }        catch (FileNotFoundException e) {            e.printStackTrace();  }   } }However, it gives out error messageException in thread \"main\" java.util.NoSuchElementExceptionI felt this error message is due to the second scanner class not closed properly. However, I did not figure out how to solve it after I added      s2.close();in the for loop.Any help is appreciated. Thank you but I am really new to Java, \nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
