Once you find it, you can remove it using the Iterator's remove() method and then add the updated element back to the PriorityQueue. This will trigger the reheapify operation and maintain the heap property. In the example code, we remove the element with value 2 and add 4 instead."

This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Reheapify java.util.PriorityQueue after updating elements: :I have a PriorityQueue containing references to some objects. When I initially insert the elements into the priority queue the ordering is maintained by the data structure. Now after a remove operation I update some of the references which are being held by the priority queue. Ideally this requires a reheapify operation on the priority queue but as is obvious since I am modifying selected references externally a reheapify cannot be triggered. So what is the best way to ensure that I am able to get the advantage of a heap like fast extract max in the presence of modifications to arbitrary elements inside the queue? I see I need a better data structure?To be more specific I need an implementation of something like a Fibonacci heap in Java.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithmIs that available?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
