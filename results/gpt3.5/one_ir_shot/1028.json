The tokens are added to the tokens list, and the delimiters are added to the delimiters list. The tokenIndex and delimiterIndex variables are used to keep track of the indices. When a token is added, the tokenIndex is incremented by 2 and the delimiterIndex is incremented by 2. This ensures that the tokens and delimiters have the correct indices."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Using the same indices between two arrays to get relevant information?: :I have a data reader that tokenizes input strings by given delimiters. The tokens go to an ArrayList, and the delimiters go to another. For example:this + is - an * inputThis sentence would be tokenized so that \"this\", \"is\", \"an\" and \"input\" would go to the token array while \"+\", \"-\" and \"*\" go to the delimiters array. Now, I need to store the original indices of these as well, so that the tokens would have indices 0, 2, 4 and 6 and the deliminators would have indices 1, 3 and 5. The normal solution would be to put them into the same array, but I need to keep them separated for performance reasons (e.g. to quickly check through the delimiters).How could this indexing be done so that when I have a token index 'i', I could easily get the deliminator from index 'i+1' without looping through all the delimiters?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
