Closed 10 years ago.I have a set of 3 strings, each in different lines, which are integers separated by spaces.1 1 23 4 44 5 5I wanted to input them into a character array, and I used StringTokenizer in this manner:for(int j=0;i<n1;i++){  s2=bure.readLine();           st1=new StringTokenizer(s2);  for(int k=0;k<n2;k++){    a[j][k]=Integer.parseInt(st1.nextToken());  }      }Where n1 and n2 are the number of rows and columns.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
