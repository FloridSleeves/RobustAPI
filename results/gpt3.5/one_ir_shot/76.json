The handshake packet is constructed as a byte array and then written to the output stream using the DataOutputStream.write() method. The write() method writes the specified byte array to the output stream. In this case, the byte array contains the handshake message. The output stream is then flushed to ensure that all data is sent to the server. If an exception occurs during the process, the code will catch the exception and print \"Failed! (Exception)\" as the output."

This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Java sending handshake packets to minecraft server: :I have been working on a java program that basically acts like Minechat(text-based app to just view chat.) I have never really worked with networking too much, so the issue is figuring out how to send packets correctly. I am currently at the position of creating the handshake with the server. After hours of research, I have come up with the following code, but it always runs into the \"Failed! (Exception)\" message. To me, everything looks correct, but for all I know it could be 100% wrong. If someone could point out what I'm doing wrong here, I'd really appreciate it.For reference, feel free to use this and this.public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {    host = new InetSocketAddress(\"162.244.165.111\", 48040);    socket = new Socket();    System.out.println(\"Connecting...\");    socket.connect(host, 3000);    System.out.println(\"Done!\");    System.out.println(\"Making streams...\");    output = new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());    input = new DataInputStream(socket.getInputStream());    System.out.println(\"Done!\");    System.out.println(\"Attempting handshake... \"+host.getAddress().toString().substring(1));    byte[] msg = (\"47;\"+host.getAddress().toString().substring(1)+\";\"+host.getPort()+\";2;\").getBytes(Charset.forName(\"UTF-16\"));    output.writeInt(msg.length+Integer.valueOf(0x00));    output.writeByte(0x00);    output.write(msg);    output.flush();    try {        if (input.readByte() != 0x02)            System.out.println(\"Failed!\");        else            System.out.println(\"Done!\");    } catch (EOFException e) {        System.out.println(\"Failed! (Exception)\");    }}EDIT:More research suggests I use a Byte array, but this confuses me on how to represent a string and using strings is required?\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:"
