This causes the buffer to still have data when the next iteration of the loop starts, resulting in incorrect data being written to the output file. To fix this, you need to call the clear() method on the buffer after writing to the output channel. Additionally, it is important to close the input and output channels after you are done using them to release system resources."

I tried reading a file using fileinputstream and file channel. I could not find out the bug in the following code. It runs successfully but file has not been transferred.
