We create an array of Strings to store the products and a 2D array of integers to store the ratings. We iterate over each line of the file using a for loop and use the StringTokenizer to split each line into tokens using the comma as the delimiter. For the first line, we store the tokens in the products array. For the remaining lines, we convert the tokens to integers and store them in the ratings array."

This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Read CSV file and use StringTokenizer: :This is a simple homework assignment that has been driving me crazy for the last few days. If I were to use a couple of Arrays I could have done it a while ago but having to use the StringTokenizer is driving me nuts. The main problem I am having is reading the CSV file. I don't know how to do it and previous searches online have only brought forward super intense solutions that are too much for a beginner like me to handle. This is my code. As you can see, I don't know whether use .nextLine() or .NextToken(). Neither seems to work.For those wondering the assignment is basically reading the first 4 products separated by commas and reading the rest of the rows as the rating of those 4 products. Basically 6 rows with 4 columns. The first row is the products the rest are the ratings.import java.util.StringTokenizer;import java.io.FileInputStream;import java.io.FileNotFoundException;import java.util.Scanner;public class ProductRating {public static void main(String[] args) {    // TODO Auto-generated method stub    Scanner fileIn=null;    try{        fileIn = new Scanner(                 new FileInputStream(\"C:/Users/Cristian/Desktop\"));    }    catch (FileNotFoundException e)     {  // This block executed if the file is not found        // and then the program exits    System.out.println(\"File not found.\");    System.exit(0);    }    //If Opened File Successful this runs    String products = \"A\";    String rantings =\"0\";    System.out.println(\"Gathering Ratings for Products\");    do{        String delimiters = \", \";        StringTokenizer gatherProducts[]=new StringTokenizer[inputLine, delimeters];        gatherProducts=fileIn.nextLine();    }while(fileIn.hasNextLine()==true);}   }\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
