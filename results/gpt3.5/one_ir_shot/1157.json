In this case, we can use it to split the input string by the \"\u00a7\" delimiter. The countTokens() method returns the number of tokens in the string, which we can use to initialize the size of the data array. We then iterate through the tokens using the hasMoreTokens() and nextToken() methods, storing each token in the data array."

This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: String.split() not behaving in android: :I have a code in Java that is meant to get the server info from a Minecraft server. This returns data split by \u00a7. In eclipse, when run as an application, the code works fine. The issue is when I bring it to Android. I have done some research on this but haven't been able to find a working solution. (Have tried Pattern.quote(\"\u00a7\")) Here is an example of what I'm running:String input = \"Look like this\u00a70\u00a725\";String[] data = input.split(\"\u00a7\");The expected data would be a 3-long String[] with the values \"Look like this\", \"0\", and \"25\". This is what happens in eclipse. In android, I get a 1-long String[] with the value \"Look like this\u00a70\u00a725\". Does anyone know if this is an issue with android or am I doing something wrong?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
