The iterator's next() method is used to move to the next element, and the remove() method is used to remove the current element. By decrementing k after each removal, you can control the number of elements to remove."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Can you efficiently remove any k elements from a map without iterating?: :I have a map I've populated (say it's a HashMap). I want it cut down to size... I don't care which elements I remove, I just want k of the elements removed.What's the most efficient way to do this (other than iterating)?Edit: k is not known in advance. Suggestions to based on other kinds of maps are relevant.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
