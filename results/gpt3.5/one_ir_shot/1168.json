In this case, we can use it to split the input sentence into words. We create a StringTokenizer object with the input string as the argument. We then create an array with the size equal to the number of tokens in the string. We iterate through the tokens using the hasMoreTokens() method and store each token in the array using the nextToken() method. Finally, we return the array of words."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How do I return an array of words given an input sentence (string)?: :How do I create a method that takes a string as an argument, and returns the array whose elements are the words in the string. This is what I have came up with so far:// split takes some string as the argument, and returns the array// whose elements are the words in the stringpublic static String[] split (String s){    // determine the number of words    java.util.Scanner t = new java.util.Scanner (s);    int countWords = 0;    String w;    while (t.hasNext ())    {        w = t.next ();        countWords++;    }    // create appropriate array and store the string\u2019s words in it    // code here}As you can see, I can just input each word via Scanner. Now I just have to put all the words of the String into an array as the elements. However, I'm not sure how to proceed.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
