It calculates the chunk size and remaining bytes based on the file size and the number of output files. It then iterates over the input file, reading chunks of data and writing them to the corresponding output file. The output file names are generated based on the index of the current iteration."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Read file and split into multiple files: :I have a file which I would like to read in Java and split this file into n (user input) output files. Here is how I read the file:int n = 4;BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"file.csv\"));try {    String line = br.readLine();    while (line != null) {        line = br.readLine();    }} finally {    br.close();}How do I split the file - file.csv into n files?Note - Since the number of entries in the file are of the order of 100k, I can't store the file content into an array and then split it and save into multiple files.\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:"
