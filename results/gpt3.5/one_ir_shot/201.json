When a client connects, a new thread is created to handle the client request. The client code creates a Socket and connects to the server. It sends a request to the server and reads the response. Both the server and client use InputStream.read to read data from the socket's input stream."

The server is connected to a database.Ok, sorry for that, it's a classic question I'm sure, but I don't know how to start.In a project I worked for they implemented a lot of magic with Proxy.newProxyInstance() to invoke the Glassfish server transparently.I don't want to use a Glassfish server. I just want something simple in plain Java. But the concept of proxies seems pretty cool.Do you have ideas or examples of such thing? How do I write the server part to handle the requests of clients?Thanks in advanceFluminis\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
