The Iterator interface provides a way to iterate over a collection and access the elements one by one. The next() method returns the next element in the iteration. By calling next() twice, you can access the current and next elements."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How do I refer to the previous and next element during an iteration?: :When I have a for loop, I use the i to refer to the elements of my array, objects, etc.  Like:Current item: myArray[i]Next item: myArray[i+1]Previous item: myArray[i-1] But at the moment, I'm using a foreach loop ( for (Object elem : col) { ).How do I refer to the previous item?(I need to do a search an 'array', which I'm doing with for (Object object : getComponents()).  But when it returns true (so it finds what I look for), it should perform the code on the previous and the next item.  Clarification: I have java.awt.Component elements!\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
