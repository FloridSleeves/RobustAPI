In this example, we are querying the \"clients\" table and selecting specific columns from both the \"clients\" and \"orders\" tables using a JOIN operation. We are filtering the results to only include rows where the client id is 2. The resulting Cursor object allows you to retrieve the data from each column using the column index or column name."
