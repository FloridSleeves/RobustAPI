This method returns an array of bytes. By summing up the unicode values of the first five characters (or less if the string is shorter), you can create a simple hash function for strings. However, keep in mind that this hash function may not be very effective in terms of distributing the hash values evenly. It may lead to collisions and uneven distribution of hash values."

And I was thinking it might be a good idea to sum up the unicode values for the first five characters in the string (assuming it has five, otherwise stop where it ends).  Would that be a good idea, or is it a bad one?I am doing this in Java, but I wouldn't imagine that would make much of a difference.\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:"
