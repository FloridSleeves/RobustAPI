It does this by implementing a new iterator that checks each element from the original iterator and only returns the even numbers. The hasNext() method checks if there are any more even numbers in the original iterator, and the next() method returns the next even number."

I am given an iterator for a list of integers. I need to write a function that returns takes this iterator as argument and returns the iterator for even numbers only. I was told, I cannot modify the original list of numbers. Hence, removing odd numbers from the list is not the solution. Please advise. Thanks.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
