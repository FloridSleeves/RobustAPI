Now, how do I read starting from the tag specified? I'm not sure where to start. The file and string sizes are variable so I couldn't really trust it. The only thing constant is the tag.EDIT: I forgot to mention that the file will be accessed from another thread/activity/app/device.Code used for appending some data:String TAG = \"CLIPPYDATA-\";String content = \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\"; //size not fixed, sample purpose only.FileOutputStream output = new FileOutputStream(\"/path/to/file\", true);try {        output.write((TAG + content).getBytes());} finally {        //output.flush(); (should I?)        output.close();}Sample output:yyvA\u017e\u00ee\u00e9\u00c3I&8Q\u00c0 \u00d8 +Z\u0160( \u00a2\u0160( \u00a2\u0160(\u00ff\u00d9CLIPPYDATA-The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.Sample input:yyvA\u017e\u00ee\u00e9\u00c3I&8Q\u00c0 \u00d8 +Z\u0160( \u00a2\u0160( \u00a2\u0160(\u00ff\u00d9CLIPPYDATA-The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.Desired Output:CLIPPYDATA-The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:"
