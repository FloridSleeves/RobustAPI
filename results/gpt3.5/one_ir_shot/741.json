To ensure that the file is downloaded as a CSV file, you need to set the Content-Type header to \"text/csv\" and remove the extra space after \"Content-Disposition:\". Additionally, it is recommended to use a PrintWriter to write the contents of the file. The writer should be flushed and closed after writing the content."

On chrome, it directly downloads the file as a *.csv format and when the user opens it, it will use Excel automatically to open the file, if they already have installed and this is the right behavior I wanted to have.However, on firefox, it prompts a save as window with open with and save options. If I use open with option, it tells me the filename is filename.csv but the type is chrome htm file. I haven't mentioned htm anywhere in my code and I dont know why its trying  to open it as htm instead of csv file. Once it tries to open it, it brings excel application and the contents are in a bad format.Is there a way to avoid this problem on firefox ?Thanks\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
