The writeShort() method of the DataOutputStream class can be used to write a short value (16-bit) to the data stream. After writing the sequence number and the image data to the data stream, you can convert the data stream to a byte array using the ByteArrayOutputStream class. Then, you can create a DatagramPacket with the packet data and send it using a DatagramSocket."
