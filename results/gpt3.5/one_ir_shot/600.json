Inside this method, you can get the result using the getIntent() method and then pass it to your desired class.\n\nHere is an example code snippet:\n\n// MainActivity.java\npublic class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {\n    private MyFragment myFragment;\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n\n        myFragment = new MyFragment();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\n        super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);\n\n        if (requestCode == 1 && resultCode == RESULT_OK) {\n            String result = data.getStringExtra(\"result\");\n            myFragment.setResult(result);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// MyFragment.java\npublic class MyFragment extends Fragment {\n    private String result;\n\n    public void setResult(String result) {\n        this.result = result;\n    }\n\n    // Use the result in your desired class\n}\n\nIn the above code, when the second activity finishes and returns the result, it will be received in the onActivityResult() method of the MainActivity class. Then, the result is passed to the MyFragment class using the setResult() method. You can then use the result in your desired class.\n\nNote: Make sure to set the result in the second activity using setResult() before calling finish().\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The List.get() method returns the element at the specified position in the list. In this case, we are using it to get the result from the Intent data in the onActivityResult() method."
