If a match is found, you can return the corresponding key. The getKeyFromValue() method in the code snippet demonstrates this approach. It iterates over the entries of the wordCountMap and returns the key for the entry with the specified value. The code snippet also sorts the values in descending order and prints the top 5 results along with their corresponding keys."

I am building a word counter in Java using Map<String, Integer> where a word is the String and the amount of times that word was said in a .txt document is Integer. This is all working great...but I am trying to develop a part where it will display at the bottom what the top 5 results are ---> what the top 5 map.values() are.The problem I have run into is after I find the value, I can't get the String with it.Any suggestions would be very helpful to me.\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:"
