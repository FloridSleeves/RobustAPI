Then, we create an ArrayList to store the positions of each '1'. We use the StringTokenizer class to split the reversed number by '1'. We iterate through the tokens and add the length of each token to the index variable. This gives us the position of each '1' in the original binary number. We add each position to the positions ArrayList. Finally, we convert the ArrayList to an int array using the stream() and mapToInt() methods."

Anyways...Take for example, an 8 bit binary representation of a number in String format, \"01110101\". If I reverse the number, I get \"10101110\". If I wanted to find the positions of each 1 and add them to an array, how would I go about doing that? I tried to use indexOf('1'), but it keeps returning 0 or 1 as the index. Edit: By end result, I mean the overall goal I'm trying to accomplish with all of this, not the question I'm asking. I just wanted to keep someone from jumping in and telling me exactly how to convert from binary to dec rather than answering my current question...Edit2: Okay, I'll be more specific. Basically, I'm trying to take a binary number(s), flip them around and get the positions of the ones and add them to an array. Then I'm going to try to iterate through the array, taking 2 to the power of each position and adding them up. Maybe not the most efficient way to convert from binary to decimal, but it's what I came up with. \nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
