In the read() method, you can check if the current position is within the desired range and return the byte value accordingly. Once the desired range is reached, you can return -1 to indicate the end of the stream. In the example code, LimitedInputStream is a custom class that takes an existing InputStream and the desired range as parameters. It overrides the read() method to enforce the range constraint. The client code can then use this LimitedInputStream to read only the specified range of bytes from the file."

So that the client code should see EOF once 100th byte is reached.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
