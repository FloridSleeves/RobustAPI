In this case, we use \":\" as the delimiter to split the currentString into two parts. We then use the nextToken() method to retrieve each part and assign them to separate strings. Finally, we use the setText() method of the TextView class to display the strings in two different TextViews."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Android Split string: :I have  a string called CurrentString and is in the form of something like this\"Fruit: they taste good\". I would like to split up the CurrentString using the : as the delimiter.So that way the word \"Fruit\" will be split into its own string and \"they taste good\" will be another string.And then i would simply like to use SetText() of 2 different TextViews to display that string. What would be the best way to approach this? \nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
