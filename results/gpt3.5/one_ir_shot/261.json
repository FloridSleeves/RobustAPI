In this case, we are using it to iterate through the online players and count them. By incrementing the virtualPlayerCount variable each time we call next(), we can keep track of the number of online players. This approach works regardless of whether you are using the setMaxPlayers() method or querying the players in a plugin."

I Thing to set a virtual number for the max Player Count I can use the Method setMaxPlayers(int mxPlayers) from the ServerListPing Event. But what about the online Players? And does it also work if I try to get the Players via a query in a plugin?Thank you for your help and sorry for my bad English ;)\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
