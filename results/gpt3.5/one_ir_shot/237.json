It returns -1 if the end of the stream is reached. In this code, we create a FileOutputStream to write the data to a file, and then use a buffer to read and write the data in chunks. The bytesRead variable keeps track of the number of bytes read in each iteration, and we write that number of bytes to the file using the write() method of the FileOutputStream. Finally, we close the FileOutputStream to ensure all data is written to the file."
