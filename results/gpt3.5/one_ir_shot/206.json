It uses two InputStreams, one for the file in the file system and the other for the file being downloaded from the HTTP URL. It reads chunks of data into byte arrays and compares them. If the number of bytes read or the content of the arrays is different, it returns false. It continues reading and comparing until the end of both files is reached. If all chunks are equal, it returns true. This approach avoids loading the entire files into memory at once, making it suitable for comparing large files without exhausting memory."

Do we have any good alternates.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
