It is able to call the read() method of the InputStream class because System.in is an instance of InputStream. Even though read() is not a static method, it can be called directly on System.in because System.in is a static variable of type InputStream. In your example, rd.read() does not work because InputStream is an abstract class and cannot be instantiated directly. You need to use a concrete subclass of InputStream, such as FileInputStream or ByteArrayInputStream, to create an instance and call the read() method on it."

This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Why Java System.in.read() can call which is not a static method: :In java, java.lang.System class, which has an in static variable. Declared as: public static final InputStream in Which means that in is an InputStream varibale. However I see some example, using System.in.read() to read input.  How can it do that, the read() method in InputStream is not a static method, how can it be directlly call it? As my understanding, only static method can call directly by a Class without creating an instance.read() declartion: public abstract int read() throws IOExceptionThank you Jon Skeet for answering, I still have some point don't understand.If I call System.in.read() which mean that I call InputStream class method read() ?java.lang.System.in -----> java.io.InputStream ----> read()calling java.lang.System.in ( which is a static variable), in is a java.io.InputStream variableThe calling act like calling PrintStream class.The process work like calling : PrintStream.read()however I have difficulty on understand the read() method, which is not a static method, as it\u2019s should not be call directly.It should be call like: PrintStream rd = new PrintStream();int c = rd.read();as read() should be call by an instance.read() declartion: public abstract int read() throws IOExceptionPS: I try this code does not work:InputStream rd = new InputStream();        int c = rd.read();        System.out.println(c);But do not know why.ref: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/InputStream.html\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
