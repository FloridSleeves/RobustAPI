The problem is that I use plain HTTP to send soap message and javax.xml for parsing response. But some services responds me with mulipart/related and it    requires much more complex logic to parse it (performance matters). So I wonder may I somehow take advantage of apache cxf, apache axiom or any other library for parsing MTOM/XOP SOAP response?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
