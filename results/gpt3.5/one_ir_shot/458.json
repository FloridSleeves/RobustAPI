In this case, you can define the class as `FooIterator<E extends Bar>`. This means that E must be a subtype of Bar. Then, in the `next()` method, you can cast the Bar object to E. However, please note that this will only work if the actual type of E at runtime is a subtype of Bar. If it's not, a ClassCastException will be thrown at runtime."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Making assumptions about type parameters?: :I want to subclass Iterator into what I'll call FooIterator. My code looks something like this:public class FooIterator<E> implements Iterator<E> {  public FooIterator(Collection<Bar> bars) {    innerIterator = bars.iterator();  }  @Override  public boolean hasNext() {    return innerIterator.hasNext();  }  @SuppressWarnings(\"unchecked\")  @Override  public E next() {    Bar bar = innerIterator.next();    return new E(bar);  }  @Override  public void remove() {    throw new UnsupportedOperationException(\"Don't remove from FooIterator!\");  }  private Iterator<Bar> innerIterator;}...except, of course, this doesn't work because I can't instantiate a new E from a Bar.I would only ever use this with an E that has a constructor that takes a Bar. Is there any way to \"prove\" that to the compiler, or to just throw a runtime error if E doesn't have an appropriate constructor?Or perhaps I'm just not using the right design pattern here? I've been doing a lot of C++ recently, and I feel like I might be approaching this the wrong way.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
