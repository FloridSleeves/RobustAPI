It takes two File objects as parameters and returns a boolean value indicating whether the contents are equal or not.\n\nIf multiple threads invoke the FileUtils.contentEquals() method in parallel, there can be race conditions and the end result of each execution may not be guaranteed. This is because the method may access shared resources or perform I/O operations, which can lead to unpredictable behavior when multiple threads are involved.\n\nTo ensure thread safety and avoid race conditions, you can synchronize the access to the method or use other concurrency control mechanisms such as locks or atomic variables."
