It returns an int value representing the byte read, or -1 if the end of the stream is reached. In Java, bytes are represented using two's complement, which means that the range of values for a byte is -128 to 127. When you add two bytes together, the result is promoted to an int. In this case, -1 + 1 + 0 = 0, but since the result is an int, it is not truncated and remains as 256."

Why?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
