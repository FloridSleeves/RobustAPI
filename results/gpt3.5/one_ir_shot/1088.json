In this case, we can use it to split the full id entered in the textfield into the string part and integer part. We can then use these parts to search the database and fill the other fields accordingly."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Java, Swing, sql- Can I match a value entered in textfield with two column in the database: :Can I match a value entered in textfield with two column in the database.It is required in a application which has  options of \"Save\" and \"search\" according to the id but id is in combined form of String and Integer (eg abc/345) and the next id is incremented version of last id ie abc/346,abc/347 So I create two columns to store id in database , first for string part and second for integer partproblem is that When I enter full id ie abc/345 in textfield and click on the \"Search button\" then the other fields should be fill according to this full id\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
