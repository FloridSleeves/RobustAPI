It returns -1 if the end of the stream is reached. In this code, we read the bytes from the \"byte.log\" file and convert them to a string. Then, we split the string based on the \"))\" characters and iterate over the substrings. For each substring, we find the index of the carriage return character (\"\\r\") and extract the hex string from the start of the substring to the carriage return character. Finally, we print the hex string."
