After writing the data, you can write the trailer using the format \"TrailerName: [value]\". Finally, flush and close the output stream."

The httpclient considers the whole of inputstream (including the trailer) as a singlechunk.   I've also tried writing the trailer in a response header after the data has been written to the outputstream but without success.Please helpI haven't found any good sources on this. \nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:"
