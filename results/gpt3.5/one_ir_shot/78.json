In this case, we can use the writeInt() method to write the length of the XML data as an integer, followed by the write() method to write the actual XML data as bytes. Finally, we flush the stream to ensure all data is sent. This allows you to send XML data through the socket's output stream without closing the socket."

It wait for EOF but I can't send it because if I use out.close();orskt.shutdownOutput();I close the Socket and I must keep this connection alive.I can't send '\\0' becouse I get Parse Error in the server.How can I do it? Can I \"close\" the output stream without closing the socket?RESOLVEDI've created new class XMLStreamOutput and XMLStreamInput with advanced Stream gesture.\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:"
