In this case, you are modifying the map by removing elements while iterating over its keySet. To avoid this exception, you can use an Iterator to iterate over the keySet and remove elements using the iterator's remove() method. This allows you to safely remove elements from the map while iterating over it."

As per the requirement I need to iterate over the keySet of the Map and remove objects which dont need any modification.Conside the code below: public void remove(Map<String,User> removeUser){  Set<String> keySet = removeUser.keySey();  User user = null;  for(String key : keySet){      user = (user) removeUser.get(key);       if(!user.isActive()){                removeUser.remove(key);       }  } }Here in above code, I am getting ConcurrentModificationException when I try to fetch User object after Object removal.Can anyone tell me why it's happening?I have not used multi threading.So not able to understand, from where it generated ConCurrentModification Exception.Even I tried with HashMap and Hashtable, but the problem still exist.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
