Achieved by doing the fallowing.List<String> listlist.add(line);What I am trying to do is see if some Id such as \"0x0640e331\" is in the list. And if it is get everything on the line of text that that Id is found. So the fallowing would happen,0x0604f552;name0;function0x0640e331;name1;function0x0342t521;name2;functionSearching for 0x0640e331 would return, 0x0640e331;name1;function.Any ideas?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
