In this case, it writes the UTF-8 BOM character '\\ufeff' to the output stream. The OutputStreamWriter is used to convert the character stream to a byte stream using the specified character encoding (\"UTF-8\"). The flush() method is then called to ensure that the character is written to the output stream."

Oracle database also has a NLS_CHARACTERSET value of UTF8.Please suggest.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
