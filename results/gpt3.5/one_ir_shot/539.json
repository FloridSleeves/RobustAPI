First, define the minimum and maximum values of the range. Then, calculate the sample size by multiplying the desired percentile (e.g., 0.2 for 20%) by the range size. Create an empty list to store the random sample. Use a for loop to generate random integers within the range using the Random.nextInt method. Add each random integer to the list."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Generating Random integers within a range to meet a percentile in java: :I am trying to generate random integers within a range to sample a percentile of that range. For example: for range 1 to 100 I would like to select a random sample of 20%. This would result in 20 integers randomly selected for 100. This is to solve an extremely complex issue and I will post solutions once I get this and a few bugs worked out. I have not used many math packages in java so I appreciate your assistance.Thanks!\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
