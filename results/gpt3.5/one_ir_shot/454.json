We generate a random number within the desired range and check if it is already in the Set. If it is, we generate a new random number until we find one that is not in the Set. Once we have a unique number, we add it to the Set and assign it to the corresponding position in the 2D array."

I currently have it filed with random numbers within the correct range, but I just cant think of a solution to have non duplicates. How could i do this using very basic java methods? I have not yet learned anything such as arraylists, or anything like that, only the very basic methods. \nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
