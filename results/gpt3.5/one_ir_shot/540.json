However, you can create a helper method to perform the addition based on the type of the numbers. In this solution, we use the Iterator.next method to iterate over the elements in the Iterable. We initialize the result variable to null and then check if it is null to handle the first element separately. We then use the add method to perform the addition based on the type of the numbers. The add method checks the type of the numbers using the instanceof operator and performs the addition accordingly."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Java 1.7: Sum of Iterable<T extends Number>: :I need to create a helper method which allows to create a sum of any Iterable<? extends Number>, because we have many vectors and require a fast method to determine the sum, so I created the following method: static Integer sum(Iterable<Integer> it) {    Integer result = 0;    for(T next : it) {        result += next;    }    return result; }This method only works for ints however, but we also have doubles and longs. Because you can't have two methods with the same signature (Our compiler thinks Integer sum(Iterable<Integer>) has the same signature as Double sum(Iterable<Double>).) I tried to write one method with generics.private static <T extends Number> T sum(Iterable<? extends T> it) {    T result;    for(T next : it) {        result += next;    }    return result;}However this method will not compile (reason: the operator += is undefined for Object, Object). What can I do here? I know in C++ you can overload operators, but not in Java. But every class which extends Number does overload the += operator. What can I do here?Thank you in advance.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
