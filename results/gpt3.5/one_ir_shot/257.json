First, you need to create a FileInputStream object to read the Excel file. Then, create a Workbook object using the FileInputStream. Next, get the desired sheet from the workbook using the getSheetAt() method. Use an Iterator to iterate over the rows in the sheet, and within each row, use another Iterator to iterate over the cells. You can then process the cell data as needed. Finally, close the FileInputStream."
