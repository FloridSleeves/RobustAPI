We then put the data into the buffer using the put() method. After that, we flip the buffer to prepare it for writing. Finally, we use the write() method of the FileChannel class to write the data from the buffer to the file. This allows us to perform bulk writing and reduce disk I/O by writing a large chunk of data at once."

Currently, I am using File Writer class. However, it is too slow. Can anybody help me how to perform bulk write in Java like maintaining a large buffer and periodically flush it.\nPlease using this api: FileChannel.write.\nAnswer:"
