Improve this question                    Suppose I have a txt file called \"filename\". The data inside is as following,N12  3934  2312  225   77   1011  8  .  .  .left column contains the x value of each point. Right column contains y value of each point. N is the number of lines Point data that follow. I need to extract all the Point data and store it in a data structure(such as List). Is there any way I can do that?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
