In this example, we create a BufferedReader object to read from a text file. We then use a while loop to read each line of the file until there are no more lines. Inside the loop, you can execute the method based on the text in the line using reflection."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Reading data from text line by line in java: :I'm making a game in Java, but can't figure out how to get information from a text file so that I can load the game. I have the saved files set up so that on every line there is the name of a method in my Main program. What I need to do is to look in a certain line for text and execute the method that the text is referring to.\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:"
