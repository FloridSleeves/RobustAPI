We check if the writer is not null before closing it to avoid NullPointerException. In the writeLine() method, we use synchronized keyword to make sure only one thread can write to the file at a time. We use a while loop to wait until the writer is not null before writing to the file. We use wait() and notifyAll() to synchronize the threads and ensure that the file is created before writing to it."
