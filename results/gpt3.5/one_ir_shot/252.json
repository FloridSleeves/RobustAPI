First, obtain the input stream from the web service. Then, create an ObjectInputStream using the input stream. Finally, use the readObject() method to read the object from the stream. You can then process the object as needed."

This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to access data from a foreign stream: :A web service is providing a binary chunked application/octet-stream.I have to build a reading client in java. I know the structure from some documentation and would like to use that stream as an ObjectInputStream, but before I can call any self made readObject methods, this approach fails, due to java.io.StreamCorruptedException: invalid stream header. What's the best way to populate java objects from such a byte stream?BTW: Data is coming in as LittleEndian, texts as 16bit chars preceeded by 4 byte size info, e.g.   03 00 00 00 41 00 62 00 63 00   (hex)would result in \"Abc\"\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
