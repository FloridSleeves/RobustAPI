In your case, you are trying to cast the returned Object to a String, but it is actually a Boolean. This can happen if you mistakenly put a Boolean value into the map using the same key. To fix this issue, you should ensure that you are putting the correct value into the map using the correct key."

This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Bug casting String, Integer, Double using HashMap: :I have some strange bug on Android 2.3 and lower.I have following code:HashMap<Somekey, Object> data = new HashMap<Somekey, Object>();data.put(somekey, \"asdfdsafdsf\");String value = (String) data.get(somekey);on the last line I have ClassCastException: get(somekey) returns Boolean value instead of String. This error appears not only with String type, with Integer and Double too.I don't understand why, because this code correctly works on android 4.0.3 and higher.\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:"
