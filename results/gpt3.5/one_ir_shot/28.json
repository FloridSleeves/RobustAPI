In the receiving activity, you can retrieve the layout name using getIntent().getStringExtra(\"layoutName\"). Then, you can use getResources().getIdentifier() to get the resource ID of the layout based on the layout name. Finally, you can call setContentView() with the layout ID to display the specific layout in the new activity."
