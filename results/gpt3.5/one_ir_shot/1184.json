In this case, it is used to read the contents of the \"test.in.txt\" file. The BufferedReader class is used to read text from a character-input stream. The readLine() method reads a line of text. The StringTokenizer class is used to break a string into tokens. In this case, it is used to break the line of text read from the file into two tokens (i1 and i2). The nextToken() method returns the next token from the StringTokenizer. The Integer.parseInt() method is used to convert the tokens into integers."

This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Simple java file reader not working: :I am creating a program where two numbers are read from one file (test.in) and then the sum is output to another file (test.out). I created the two files as TXT documents in the bin folder of my project but it still gives this Exception in thread \"main\" java.io.FileNotFoundException: test.in.txt (The system cannot find the file specified)    at java.io.FileInputStream.open0(Native Method)    at java.io.FileInputStream.open(Unknown Source)    at java.io.FileInputStream.<init>(Unknown Source)    at java.io.FileInputStream.<init>(Unknown Source)    at java.io.FileReader.<init>(Unknown Source)    at test.main(test.java:11)The files are not showing up in my project directory on the left hand side of the screen, it just won't work.import java.io.*;import java.util.*;public class test {    public static void main (String [] args) throws IOException {        BufferedReader f = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"test.in.txt\"));        PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(\"test.out.txt\")));        StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(f.readLine());        int i1 = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());    // first integer        int i2 = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());    // second integer        out.println(i1+i2);                           // output result        out.close();                                  // close the output file      }}\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
