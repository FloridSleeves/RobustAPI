Then, you can use the Iterator.next method to select one implementation based on certain rules contained within the message. Once you have the selected implementation, you can call the processMessage method on it to transmit the message accordingly. This approach allows you to dynamically select the appropriate implementation based on the message content."

This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Inject list of service objects in CDI (Weld): :Let's say I have an interface called SocialNetworkService, and multiple implementations - TwitterService, FacebookService and FriendFeedService, MyService etc.Now I want, whenever my managed bean receives a message, to select one/or more implementations depending on certain rules contained within the message and transmit the message accordingdly.I am not quite sure which would be the best pattern to use?a) Use Interface Instance i.e@Inject @Any Instance<SocialNetworkService> socialNetworkService;SocialNetworkService service = socialNetworkService.get();How would I pass the message to the SocialNetworkServiceFactory ?b) Use Events observe the event in all services (regardless of their interface, which is not exactly what i would like. I.e if i dont support dont transmit...c). i could have annotaded injection i.e@Twitter, @Facebook all in a controller bean and then select the appropriate but my service implementations number will grow....Thanks in advance,Dimitri\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
