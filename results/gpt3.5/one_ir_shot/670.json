This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Not working I/O method: :I'm pretty new to JAVA, so I do not really see what I am doing wrong within the following method:public void writeWNDFile(){        String strFilePath = \"C:/Users/fperrone/Desktop/ddd.txt\";        try        {          //create FileOutputStream object          FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(strFilePath);           DataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(fos);           dos.writeDouble(12);                       dos.close();        }        catch (IOException e)        {          System.out.println(\"IOException : \" + e);        }    }The file is actually generated, but I don't get 12 as printed and expected result, but @(, which probably is the ASCII representation.May you shed some light?EDITDoes eventually exist a JAVA function behaving similarly to the MATLAB fwrite function? I actually wanna write a binary file. In MATLAB I am simply calling:fwrite(filename, A, precision)How could I achieve the same in JAVA?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
