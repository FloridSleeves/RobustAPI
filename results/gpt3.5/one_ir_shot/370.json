Sets are designed to store unique elements and do not have a specific order. To retrieve data from a set, you can use an iterator to iterate over the elements. The iterator's next() method can be used to retrieve the next element in the set."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Why doesn't java.util.Set have get(int index)?: :I'm sure there's a good reason, but could someone please explain why the java.util.Set interface lacks get(int Index), or any similar get() method?It seems that sets are great for putting things into, but I can't find an elegant way of retrieving a single item from it.If I know I want the first item, I can use set.iterator().next(), but otherwise it seems I have to cast to an Array to retrieve an item at a specific index?What are the appropriate ways of retrieving data from a set? (other than using an iterator)I'm sure the fact that it's excluded from the API means there's a good reason for not doing this -- could someone please enlighten me?EDIT:Some extremely great answers here, and a few saying \"more context\".  The specific scenario was a dbUnit test, where I could reasonably assert that the returned set from a query had only 1 item, and I was trying to access that item.However, the question is more valid without the scenario, as it remains more focussed:What's the difference between set and list.Thanks to all for the fantastic answers below.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
