We then iterate n times to get the id and time values for each element and add them to their respective lists. We then create a JPanel with a GridLayout to display the elements in a grid format. For each element, we create two JTextFields, one for the id and one for the time, and add them to the panel. Finally, we add the panel to the JFrame, pack it to adjust its size, and make it visible."
