After reaching a certain point I want to be able to just take what is left of the string after the current position(I want to then use it recursively)If I do StringTokenizer sTokenizer = new StringTokenizer(expression);//operations with some of the tokens hereSystem.out.println(sTokenizer.nextToken());it will delimit by spaces.I triedsTokenizer.nextToken(null)but that just throws a null pointer exception.I know I could just put some random string in the parameter that is unlikely to show up in the expression, but that isn't ideal.If I were implementing this with substringsexpression.substring(currentposition)would work, but I need stringtokenizer.In short, I'm trying to figure out a way to retrieve the remainder of a string(that is being used by stringtokenizer) as a single token.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
