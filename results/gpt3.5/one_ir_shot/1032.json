It creates a StringTokenizer object with the input string and uses a for loop to iterate through the tokens. It checks if there are more tokens using the hasMoreTokens() method and assigns the next token to the \"token\" variable. After the loop, it returns the third token."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Returning the nth Token: :I'm very new at Java and I have a question about a summer assignment. These are the instructions:Write a class called SpecialToken that has a static method called thirdToken. Thismethod should return as a String, the third token of a String that you pass as a parameter. You may assume that spaces will serve as delimiters.This is what I have so far but honestly I am stumped at what the parameter should be and how to return the third token! I was thinking I could do something like nextToken() until the third.public class SpecialToken {    public static String thirdToken() {    }}\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
