The performance of the two loops depends on various factors such as the size of the collection, the complexity of the code inside the loop, and the specific implementation of the Iterator. The difference in performance you observed in your unit tests could be due to other factors and may not be directly related to the change in the loop structure. It is recommended to use a profiler tool to accurately measure the performance of different code snippets."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: which loop is faster?: :I have this loopfor (it= someCollection.iterator; it.hasNext(); ){    //some code here}I changed it to:for (it= someCollection.iterator;; ){    if (!it.hasNext())        break;    //some code here}The second code ran a little bit faster in unit tests in junit on eclipse.Is the second loop faster? I'm asking because the times given by Junit are not too exact, but they give an approximate value\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
