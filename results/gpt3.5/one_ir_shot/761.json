To write the file to a directory, you can use a FileOutputStream to create a new file in the specified directory and write the contents of the input stream to it. The PrintWriter.write() method can be used to write the file extension to the writer."

I am stuck trying to figure out how to get the file extension of the uploaded file, how to write the file to a directory and the worst part is where the person who wrote the example comments // Process the input stream... It leaves me wondering if it's something so trivial that I'm the only one  who doesn't know how to. \nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
