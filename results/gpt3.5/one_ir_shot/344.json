We set the expectations for the iterator to return \"A\" when next() is called. The hasNext() method is set to return true on the first call and false on the second call. This simulates a list with one element. The for loop iterates over the mockList, and the flag is set to true, indicating that the loop was executed. Finally, we assert that the flag is true, ensuring that the loop was executed."

This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Testing Java enhanced for behavior with Mockito: :I want to test a java method that has an enhanced for on it using Mockito. The problem is that when I don't know how to set the expectations for the enhanced for to work. The following code was gotten from an unanswered question in the mockito google group: import static org.mockito.Mockito.when;import static org.testng.Assert.assertTrue;import java.util.ArrayList;import java.util.Iterator;import java.util.List;import org.mockito.Mockito;import org.testng.annotations.Test;public class ListTest{  @Test  public void test()  {    List<String> mockList = Mockito.mock(List.class);    Iterator<String> mockIterator = Mockito.mock(Iterator.class);    when(mockList.iterator()).thenReturn(mockIter);    when(mockIter.hasNext()).thenReturn(true).thenReturn(false);    when(mockIter.next()).thenReturn(\"A\");    boolean flag = false;    for(String s : mockList) {        flag = true;    }    assertTrue(flag);  }} The code inside the for loop never gets executed. Setting expectations for an iterator doesn't work, because the java enhanced for doesn't use the list iterator internally. Setting expectations for List.get() method doesn't either since the enhanced for implementation doesn't seem to call the get() method of the list either. Any help will be much appreciated.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
