However, it seems I cannot find a way to do it.. I tried with JMF, but I get java.io.IOException: Invalid Http response everytime I run the code.Here is what I tried:Player player = Manager.createPlayer(new URL(\"http://50.7.98.106:8398\"));player.start();The .pls file:[playlist]NumberOfEntries=1File1=http://50.7.98.106:8398/In the piece of code above I'm setting the URL by hand, just for testing, but I've sucessfuly done the .pls downloading code and it's working, and from this I make another question, is it a better approach to just simply play the .pls file locally? Can it be done?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
