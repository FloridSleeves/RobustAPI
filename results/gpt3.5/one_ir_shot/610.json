Since the value of 'x' is not used in the calculation, it doesn't matter what value it has. The List.get method is not used in this specific code snippet."

For example if the input data is 2, 4, 8, 9 then the function would be 2 + 4x + 8x^2 + 9x^3.Now I do know how to process the input data etc. but I don't know how to declare a variable that has no value, for example I declared a variable x = double, but I still have to initialize it but I don't want to give x a value at this point yet?So how can I write a method that for example returns 'x' to the power of something?This is what I have at the moment (it still doesn't work of course)public class Interpol {public static void main(String []args) {    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);        //get user input (polynomial coefficients and interval values x1 and x2)        ArrayList<Double> polynomialCoefficients = new ArrayList<Double>();        int amountCoefficients = 0;        while (scanner.hasNextDouble()) {            polynomialCoefficients.add(scanner.nextDouble());            amountCoefficients++;        }        String in = scanner.next();        double x1 = scanner.nextDouble();        double x2 = scanner.nextDouble();        //call method f to determine the polynomial function        double x;        double[] termsFunction = new double[amountCoefficients];        for (int i = 0; i < polynomialCoefficients.size(); i++) {            termsFunction[i] = f(i, polynomialCoefficients.get(i));        }        //call method findaroot to determine the root        //print result}//determine function of which a root is to be foundpublic static double f(int i, double polynomialCoefficient) {    if (i == 0) {        return polynomialCoefficient;    }    double x;    return polynomialCoefficient * (Math.pow(x, i));}/*  //rounds off d to 3 decimals public static double rnd(double d) {}//returns a root in this interval, recursive function public static double findaroot{double x1, double x2) {}*/}\nPlease using this api: List.get.\nAnswer:"
