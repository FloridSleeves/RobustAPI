Data is actually based on key-value structure.Like;100 \"white\"200 \"black\"300 \"red\"and like that. What I want to do is to change the key-value pairs according to I don't know yet, some algorithm.But they need to be shuffled like this, but shuffling need to be not random, so I can revert data when I need.100 \"red\"200 \"white\"300 \"black\"I don't really know how my approach should be to the solution. Should I use HashTable or something, and how can I shuffle them dynamically?Any help is appreciated\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
