The next() method returns the next element in the iteration, but it does not remove it from the set. To remove the element, you need to call the remove() method after calling the next() method.\n\nHere is the corrected code:\n\npublic void foo(Set<Object> set){\n    Iterator<Object> iterator = set.iterator();\n    if(iterator.hasNext()){\n        Object obj = iterator.next();\n        iterator.remove();\n    }\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The next() method returns the next element in the iteration, but it does not remove it from the set.
