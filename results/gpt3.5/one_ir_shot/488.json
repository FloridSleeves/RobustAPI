By using this method in a loop, you can iterate over a collection lazily, fetching elements only when needed. This is similar to the concept of \"yield return\" in C#."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Is there a yield return in java for lazy fetching in hibernate?: :I understand that a \"yield return\" (C# construct) is not available in Java. However, when I do lazy loading in Java/Hibernate. What is the recommended way to iterate over the collection using lazy loading and something similar to yield return ?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
