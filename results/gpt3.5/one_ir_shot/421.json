The next() method of the Iterator interface returns the next element in the iteration. After processing a job with a host, you can check if there are more hosts using the hasNext() method. If there are no more hosts, you can reset the iterator to the beginning of the list to achieve a round-robin scheduling approach."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: round robin scheduling java iterators: :I have a list of hosts in an array which represnt the servers available to do a particular job. Currently I simply iterate thru the list looking and establish comms with a host to check its not busy. If not I will send a job to it. This approach tends to mean that the first host in the list tends to get hot constanly with the load not balanced properly with the rest of the available hosts.in pseudocode ..for (Host h : hosts) {    //checkstatus    if status == job accepted break;}I'd like to balance this load properly between the hosts i.e first time host one is used 2nd time the method is used host 2. Just wondering that the most elegant solution to this is ??ThanksW\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
