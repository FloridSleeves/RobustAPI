In this case, we are retrieving the value of the \"os.arch\" property, which represents the operating system architecture. We then check if the architecture contains \"64\" to determine if a 64-bit JRE is installed."

I already know that I can check a system property \"sun.arch.data.model\", but this is Sun-specific. I'm wondering if there is a standard solution for this.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
