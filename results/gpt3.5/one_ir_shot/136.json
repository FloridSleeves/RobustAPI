I found similar questions but i haven't exactly got my answer. So please forgive me if i have done something wrong.I'm trying to save an image from an ImageView in my app to a folder in my sdcard. Here's the code :-public void save(View view) {    myImage.setDrawingCacheEnabled(true);    Bitmap imgV = myImage.getDrawingCache();    String root = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().toString();    File myDir = new File(root + \"/AVP_saved\");    String fname=\"Image.png\";    File file = new File(myDir, fname);        try {               FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(file);               imgV.compress(Bitmap.CompressFormat.PNG, 90, out);               out.flush();               out.close();               Toast.makeText(this, \"Image Downloaded\", 7000).show();        } catch (Exception e) {               e.printStackTrace();               Toast.makeText(this, e.getMessage(), 8000).show();        }    }'save' method is the method assigned to a button. 'myImage' is the ImageView found by its id. I have already set the permissions in the manifest. The thing is, the image dosen't get saved and it says that the path dosen't exist. When I myself create the folder \"AVP_saved\", then the image gets saved. What do i have to edit in this code such that the app creates the folder by itself when i click the button?Thanks for your time!\nPlease using this api: File.mkdirs.\nAnswer:"
