It returns the total number of bytes read into the buffer, or -1 if there is no more data because the end of the stream has been reached. In this case, we use the bytesRead variable to keep track of the actual number of bytes read from the stream and pass it as the length parameter when creating the ByteArrayInputStream. This ensures that only the actual data read from the stream is used to create the ByteArrayInputStream, starting from the correct position."
