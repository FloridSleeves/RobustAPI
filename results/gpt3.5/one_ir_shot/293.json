The hasNext() method checks if there are more elements in the collection, and the next() method returns the next element. We can add the condition doesWordMatch == true to the while loop to control the loop execution."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: add additional parameters to foreach loop: :I have a foreach loop that goesboolean doesWordMatch = false;for(Character[] charArr : charSets){  if(doesWordMatch)    //dosomething  else    break;}I was wondering, is there anyway to put the condition into the for loop? e.g.for(Character[] charArr : charSets && doesWordMatch == true){  //dosomething}edit-- Right, so would this be possible in a while loop? :o\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
