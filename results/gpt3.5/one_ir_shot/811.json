In the filter I am using HTTPResponseWrapper for modifying the response to the user. My code in doFilter method of Filter is:CharArrayWrapper responseWrapper = new CharArrayWrapper(        (HttpServletResponse) response); chain.doFilter(request, responseWrapper);String responseString = responseWrapper.toString();System.out.println(\"responseString ********************* \"        + responseString);PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();out.write(responseString);The CharArrayWrapper class is:public class CharArrayWrapper extends HttpServletResponseWrapper {    private CharArrayWriter charWriter;    public CharArrayWrapper(HttpServletResponse response) {        super(response);        charWriter = new CharArrayWriter();    }    public PrintWriter getWriter() {        return (new PrintWriter(charWriter));    }    public String toString() {        return (charWriter.toString());    }    public char[] toCharArray() {        return (charWriter.toCharArray());    }}If the JSP for which the above filter is configured executes fine, there is no problem in the filter too and I can see the sysout on the console. On the other hand, when there is some unhandled exception raised in the JSP scriptlet code (its an old application) and I invoke chain.doFilter(request, responseWrapper);,  I get a NullPointerException. Is there any way by which I can know in my filter that there was an unhandled exception raised in the JSP\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
