Inside this class, you can have a field of type Iterator<Item> called delegate, which will be the backing iterator. In the next() method, you can call the delegate's next() method to get the next Item object, and then create a new FacadeItem object using that Item object. This new FacadeItem object can then be returned as the next element in the iterator."
