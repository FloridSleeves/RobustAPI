It initializes two variables, fibn and fibnext, with the first two elements of the ArrayList. Then, it enters a loop that calculates the next Fibonacci number (fibnew) and checks if it matches the next element in the ArrayList. If it doesn't match, the method returns false. If it matches, the variables fibn and fibnext are updated and the loop continues until the end of the ArrayList. If the loop completes without returning false, the method returns true, indicating that the ArrayList is part of the Fibonacci sequence."

This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Java: check if arraylist is part of fibonacci sequence: :My assignment for school is to implement a method that checks if a given ArrayList is part of the Fibonacci sequence.The array must not be empty and must be bigger than 3.I understood that I have to check if one number of the array and the next one are part of the Fibonacci sequence, however I have a lot of trouble with it since you're supposed to accept the array if it's any part of the sequence and not just from the start.e.g.: 0 1 1 2 3 5 will be accepted as well as 2 3 5 8 13 21.This is my code so far. I know it's very flawed but i really have no clue how to move on.public class ArrayCheck { /** * Tests if the given array is a part of the Fibonacci sequence. * * @param arr array to be tested * @return true if the elements are part of the fibonacci sequence */public boolean isFibonacci(ArrayList<Integer> arr) {    //check if array exists    if(arr.size() == 0)        return false;    //check if array is bigger than 3    if (arr.size() < 3)        return false;    //check for the startsequence of 0,1,1    else if(arr.get(0) == 0 && arr.get(1) == 1 && arr.get(2) == 1)        return true;    //check every number in array    for(int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {        //check if i >= 2 is fib        if(i >= 2) {            int fibn = i;            int nextfib = i + 1;            int fibnew = (fibn - 1) + (fibn - 2);            int fibnext = (nextfib - 1) + (nextfib - 2);            if (arr.get(i) != fibnew && arr.get(i + 1) != fibnext)                return false;        }        //check if the order is right        if(arr.get(i) > arr.get(i+1))            return false;    }    return true;}Any help is greatly appreciated!\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
