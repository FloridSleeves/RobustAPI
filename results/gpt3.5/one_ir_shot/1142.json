The issue you are facing is most likely due to the content of the input file \"ride.in\". Make sure that the file contains at least two lines of text, each separated by a space. If the file is empty or does not contain enough lines, you will encounter a NoSuchElementException when calling st.nextToken() on the second line.\n\nIf you have confirmed that the input file is correct, you can try adding some error handling to your code to handle the case where there are not enough tokens in the second line. For example, you can use the hasMoreTokens() method to check if there are more tokens available before calling nextToken():\n\n<<<code>>>: \nif (st.hasMoreTokens()) {\n    String s2 = st.nextToken();\n    // rest of your code\n} else {\n    // handle the case where there are not enough tokens in the second line\n}\n\nThis way, if there are not enough tokens in the second line, you can handle the situation gracefully without encountering a NoSuchElementException."
