However, the token is of type Object, so it doesn't have the equals() method that compares the content of the string. To fix this, you need to cast the token to a String before comparing it with \"Table\". You can do this by changing the declaration of the token variable to Object and casting it to String when comparing it with \"Table\"."

Object token is supposed to be read as 'Table'.        void process() {        Iterator fileIterator = fileContent.iterator();        int state = 0;        Object token = null;        switch (state) {        case 0:            token = fileIterator.next();            if (token.equals(\"Table\")) {                System.out.println(token);                state = 1;            } else {                System.err.println(\"Corrupt file format at state 0: \"+ token);                System.exit(0);            }            break;        }    }This doesn't switch state to 1, instead it prints out:'Corrupt file format at state 0: Table'So it seems as it reads the Object token correctly as 'Table' but not for the statement 'if (token.equals(\"Table\"))'. I have also tried 'if (token == (\"Table\"))'Can somebody help me?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
