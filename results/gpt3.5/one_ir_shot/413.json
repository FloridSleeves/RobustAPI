In each iteration, you can create a new sublist and add elements to it using the next() method of the Iterator. The loop will continue until there are no more elements in the list or until the desired sublist size is reached. This approach avoids creating unnecessary temporary ArrayList objects and is more efficient for large lists."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Efficient way to divide a list into lists of n size: :I have an ArrayList, which I want to divide into smaller List objects of n size, and perform an operation on each.My current method of doing this is implemented with ArrayList objects in Java. Any pseudocode will do.    for (int i = 1; i <= Math.floor((A.size() / n)); i++) {            ArrayList temp = subArray(A, ((i * n) - n),                    (i * n) - 1);            // do stuff with temp        }    private ArrayList<Comparable> subArray(ArrayList A, int start,                int end) {            ArrayList toReturn = new ArrayList();            for (int i = start; i <= end; i++) {                toReturn.add(A.get(i));            }            return toReturn;        }where A is the list and n is the size of the desired listsI believe this way is taking too much time when working with considerably large lists of up to 1 million in size, so I'm trying to figure out what would be more efficient.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
