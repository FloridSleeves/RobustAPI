This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: What Java class allows to write to a file, both in Binary and ASCII?: :I need to write files, with Headers in ASCII and values in Binary.For now, I'm using this:File file = new File(\"~/myfile\");FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(file);// Write in ASCIIout.write((\"This is a header\\n\").getBytes());// Write a byte[] is quite easybyte[] buffer = new buffer[4];out.write(buffer, 0, 4);// Write an int in binary gets complicatedout.write(ByteBuffer.allocate(4).putInt(6).array());//Write a float in binary gets even more complicatedout.write(ByteBuffer.allocate(4).order(ByteOrder.BIG_ENDIAN)        .putFloat(4.5).array());The problem is that it's very slow (in terms of performance) to write that way, way slower than writing the values in ASCII actually. But it should be shorter since in I'm writing less data.I've looked at other Java classes, and it seems to me that they are either only for ASCII writing, or only for Binary writing.Would you have any other proposition for this problem ?\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:"
