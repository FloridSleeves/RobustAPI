We keep track of the number of lines read using the count variable. Inside the loop, we check if the count is equal to the (amount of lines) - 1, which means we have reached the last line before the \"word\" line. If so, we break out of the loop to stop reading further lines. Otherwise, we continue to tokenize the line and add the integers to the graph."

No problem therebut then i have this for-loopfor (int i = 0; i < (amount of lines); i++) {        StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());        graph.addEdge(Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken()), Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken()));    }i cant write in the code how many times i want it to put integers, because my code should run generally with other inputs...How can i make it stop before the last line, i still need to be able to use the last bufferreaderline\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
