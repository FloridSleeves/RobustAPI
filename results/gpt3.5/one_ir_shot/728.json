The FileWriter object is set to append mode by passing \"true\" as the second parameter. Then, a for loop is used to iterate from 1 to 10. Inside the loop, the ans is calculated using your logic and written to the file using the PrintWriter's println() method. Finally, the writer is closed to ensure that all data is written to the file."
