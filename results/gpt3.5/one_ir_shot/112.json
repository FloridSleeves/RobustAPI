If this condition is satisfied, it sets the start flag to true. Then, it writes the characters to the output file using the DataOutputStream.write() method. However, the issue with the code is that it is comparing bytes with characters, which may not work as expected. To fix this, you can modify the code to compare bytes instead of characters. Here's an updated version of the code:\n\nInputStream is = new FileInputStream(\"D:\\\\Users\\\\Vinoth\\\\workspace\\\\Testing\\\\Testing_2.doc\");\nDataInputStream dis = new DataInputStream(is);\nOutputStream os = new FileOutputStream(\"D:\\\\Users\\\\Vinoth\\\\workspace\\\\Testing\\\\Testing_3.doc\");\nDataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(os);\nbyte[] buff = new byte[dis.available()];\ndis.readFully(buff);\nbyte temp = 0;\nboolean start = false;\ntry{\n    for(byte b:buff){\n        if(temp == -48 && b == -113){\n            start = true;\n        }\n        if(start){\n            dos.write(b);\n        }\n        temp = b;\n    }\n}\nThis code compares the bytes -48 and -113 with the bytes read from the input file. If the condition is satisfied, it sets the start flag to true and writes the bytes to the output file."
