The append() method of StringBuilder returns a reference to the StringBuilder itself, so you don't need to reassign it to the Request variable. Also, make sure to print the Request after appending the strings to check if it is empty or not. Additionally, when writing the Request to the output stream, you need to convert it to bytes using the getBytes() method. Similarly, when writing tmp to the client output stream, you also need to convert it to bytes using the getBytes() method."

(codes changed)class Threading extends Thread{Socket server;Socket client;StringBuilder Request;Threading(Socket sck,Socket srv){    client = sck;    server = srv;    Request = new StringBuilder();}@Overridepublic void run() {    try    {        DataOutputStream clientout = new DataOutputStream(client.getOutputStream());        BufferedReader clientinput = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(client.getInputStream()));        System.out.println(\"---------REQUEST--------\");        String tmp =\"THIS\";        while((tmp=clientinput.readLine())!=null)        {            Request = Request.append(tmp);        }        System.out.println(Request.toString());//Request is empty!!!
