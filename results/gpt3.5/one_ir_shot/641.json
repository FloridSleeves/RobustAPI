It iterates through the array, rounds each element to the desired precision, and updates the count in the HashMap. Then, it iterates through the HashMap to find the mode (the element with the highest frequency) that meets the frequency requirement. The precision is gradually decreased by reducing the number of decimal places in the rounding format. The code uses the getOrDefault() method of the Map interface to handle the case when an element is not present in the map."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Finding a mode with decreasing precision: :I feel like there should be an available library to more simply do two things, A) Find the mode to an array, in the case of doubles and B) gracefully degrade the precision until you reach a particular frequency.So imagine an array like this:double[] a = {1.12, 1.15, 1.13, 2.0, 3.4, 3.44, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4};If I was looking for a frequency of 3 then it would go from 2 decimal positions to 1 decimal, and finally return 1.1 as my mode.  If I had a frequency requirement of 4 it would return 4 as my mode.I do have a set of code that is working the way I want, and returning what I am expecting, but I feel like there should be a more efficient way to accomplish this, or an existing library that would help me do the same.  Attached is my code, I'd be interested in thoughts / comments on different approaches I should have taken....I have the iterations listed to limit how far  the precision can degrade.public static double findMode(double[] r, int frequencyReq){    double mode = 0d;    int frequency = 0;    int iterations = 4;    HashMap<Double, BigDecimal> counter = new HashMap<Double, BigDecimal>();    while(frequency < frequencyReq && iterations > 0){        String roundFormatString = \"#.\";        for(int j=0; j<iterations; j++){            roundFormatString += \"#\";        }        DecimalFormat roundFormat = new DecimalFormat(roundFormatString);        for(int i=0; i<r.length; i++){            double element = Double.valueOf(roundFormat.format(r[i]));            if(!counter.containsKey(element))                counter.put(element, new BigDecimal(0));            counter.put(element,counter.get(element).add(new BigDecimal(1)));        }        for(Double key : counter.keySet()){            if(counter.get(key).compareTo(new BigDecimal(frequency))>0){                mode = key;                frequency = counter.get(key).intValue();                log.debug(\"key: \" + key + \" Count: \" + counter.get(key));            }        }        iterations--;    }    return mode;}EditAnother way to rephrase the question, per Paulo's comment: the goal is to locate a number where in the neighborhood are at least frequency array elements, with the radius of the neighborhood being as small as possible. \nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:"
