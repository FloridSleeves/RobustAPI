It returns the number of bytes written, possibly zero. This method is safe to be called from multiple threads as long as each thread has its own buffer and does not share the same channel. However, if multiple threads are writing to the same channel, you should synchronize the write operations to ensure that the messages are not mixed."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Write to FileOutputStream from multiple threads in Java: :Is it safe to call write on Java FileOutputStream object form multiple threads? Will the output be serialized correctly?clarification:In my case the class logger holds a FileOutputStream reference, and multiple threads can call logger write, that formats the output and calls FileOutputStream write.Should I synchronize my logger write method to warrant that the messages from multiple threads are not mixed?\nPlease using this api: FileChannel.write.\nAnswer:"
