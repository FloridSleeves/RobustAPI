The summation method takes an Iterator as a parameter and recursively calculates the sum by adding the current element to the sum of the remaining elements. The base case is when the iterator has no more elements, in which case we return 0. This solution does not use an index and is non-iterative."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Different ways of using recursion in Java: :I'm thinking of several elegant ways of writing a simple Lisp-like recursive function in Java that does, let's say, a simple summation.In Common Lisp it would be like this:(defun summation(l)    (if l        (+ (car l) (summation (cdr l)))        0))(summation '(1 2 3 4 5)) ==> 15In Java the one of many possible solutions would be:public int summation(int[] array, int n) {    return (n == 0)            ? array[0]            : array[n] + summation(array, n - 1);}CALL: summation(new int[]{1,2,3,4,5}, 4); //151) Is there any possible way NOT to use the index n? 2) Or leave your solution (non-iterational) which you see as interesting. Thanks.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
