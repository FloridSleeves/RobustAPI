However, the java.lang.AssertionError is typically thrown when an assertion made by the code fails. It is possible that there is an incorrect assertion in the iterator test that is causing the error. \n\nTo fix the error, you can review the iterator test code and check if the assertions being made are correct. Make sure that the expected values match the actual values returned by the iterator.next() method. Additionally, ensure that the iterator is properly initialized and that the elements in the SortedArrayList are in the expected order.\n\nIf you provide the code for the iterator test, I can provide more specific guidance on how to fix the error."

My professor send us a JUnit test so we can know if our code is working correctly. Now every method has passed the test except the iterator test which fails the test. It appears to be a java.lang.AssertionError and I cant seem to figure out a way of fixing it. If you could see the error and point it out to me would be awesome. Thanks in advance\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
