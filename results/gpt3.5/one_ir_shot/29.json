Then, in your onPostExecute method, you can call the showColumnCounts method on the UI thread using the runOnUiThread method of the Activity class.\n\nHere is an example:\n\npublic class MyAsyncTask extends AsyncTask<Void, Void, String> {\n    private Activity mActivity;\n\n    public MyAsyncTask(Activity activity) {\n        mActivity = activity;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected String doInBackground(Void... voids) {\n        // Perform background task\n        return \"result\";\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onPostExecute(String s) {\n        super.onPostExecute(s);\n        mActivity.runOnUiThread(new Runnable() {\n            @Override\n            public void run() {\n                showColumnCounts();\n            }\n        });\n        dataDownloadCompleteToast();\n    }\n}\n\nThen, in your Activity class, when you create an instance of MyAsyncTask, pass the reference of your Activity to the constructor:\n\nMyAsyncTask task = new MyAsyncTask(this);\n\nMake sure to call setContentView in your Activity's onCreate method before executing the AsyncTask:\n\n@Override\nprotected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n    task.execute();\n}\n\nThis way, the showColumnCounts method will be called on the UI thread and should work as expected."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: AsyncTask onPostExecute UI Changes: :It is always the little things that stump me for hours.I have an onPostExecute method from an AsyncTask class that looks like so: @Override    protected void onPostExecute(String s) {                               super.onPostExecute(s);        showColumnCounts();        dataDownloadCompleteToast();    }The toast works just fine. However, my showColumnCounts() method refuses to work. It works just fine on the main thread. I use it during onCreate() just not here. I thought the onPostExecute ran on the UI thread?Here is my showColumnCounts() method if it is relevant. public void showColumnCounts() {    TextView totalView = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.totalColumn2);    TextView ignoredView = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.ignoredColumn2);    TextView rView = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.rColumn2);    Cursor c = myDB.getEmptyRColumn(\"\");    int count = c.getCount();    if (count == 0) {        c.close();        return;    }    String unread = String.valueOf(count);    String total = getTotalCount();    int tTotal = Integer.parseInt(total);    int r = tTotal - count;    String read = String.valueOf(r);    totalView.setText(total);    ignoredView.setText(unread);    rView.setText(read);    c.close();}I've been fiddling with it for a while now assuming the answer should be obvious but I'm calling uncle. Can't figure it.Edit***** 6/30I THINK I've found my problem. In my background thread I am using a parse.com method \"query.findInBackground\" which I assume is starting a third thread? I'm trying to update this to \"query.find\" and I'm hoping that will fix.\nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer:"
