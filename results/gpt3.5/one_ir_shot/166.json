In this case, you can use FileInputStream to create an InputStream from the file \"D:\\\\test.bmp\". Then, you can use the drawImage() method of the Graphics class to draw the image on the applet window."

The following is my code.  The picture (test.bmp) does exist and is on the D drive but when I run this I get the applet window with nothing in it.  Can somebody tell me what I am missing to make the ImageIcon show?public class Form1 extends JApplet {    ImageIcon i;    public void init(){        i = new ImageIcon(\"D:\\test.bmp\");    }    public void paint(Graphics g){        i.paintIcon(this, g, 0, 0);    }}Thanks, Steve.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
