You can do this by using the findViewById() method on the activity object. However, since you are in a non-activity class, you need to cast the context to an Activity object first. Additionally, since you are modifying the UI, you need to run the code on the UI thread using the runOnUiThread() method."

Here's the code:LayoutInflater mInflater = (LayoutInflater) mContext.getSystemService(mContext.LAYOUT_INFLATER_SERVICE);View view = mInflater.inflate(R.layout.target_details, null);TextView val = (TextView) view.findViewById(R.id.val);Not sure if I'm doing it properly.UPDATE:I used Kay's answer with added code below. It's now working.((Activity)mContext).runOnUiThread(new Runnable(){        @Override        public void run(){            //settext here        }    });\nPlease using this api: Activity.findViewById.\nAnswer:"
