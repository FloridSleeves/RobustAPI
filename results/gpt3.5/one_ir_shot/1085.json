This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Inline external CSS with HTML: :I am looking for a java library which can inline an external CSS file with a HTML document based on its ID/class attributes.I've found jStyleParser but I am not sure if this is the right library for me. I seem to fail to understand if it can do the job of inlining the CSS on the elements from the HTML. The documentation and examples is not what I expected.Is there anyone who can answer that question or does there exist another library for this?Thanks\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
