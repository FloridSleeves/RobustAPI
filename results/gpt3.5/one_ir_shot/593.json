This mapping allows us to access any node in O(1) time using the List.get() method. To move a node with a specific ID to the end of the list, we can retrieve the node from the ArrayList using List.get() and then use the Doubly Linked List's remove() and addLast() methods to move the node to the desired position."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Arraylist mapping to linkedlist nodes: :I want to be able to access a certain node in my Doubly Linked List in O(1) time. I know that if i traverse the list to find a certain node it would take O(n) time so I want to map the nodes to an array list where I can access the nodes in O(1) time.I'm really unsure how I would do this mapping. I would like to see an example of how this can be done.Edit:I would like to be able to access any node in the linked list so I can move the nodes around in O(1) time.Example: Move node with ID 5 to end of list in O(1) time. Edit 2: I uploaded a picture example of what I'm trying to accomplish\nPlease using this api: List.get.\nAnswer:"
