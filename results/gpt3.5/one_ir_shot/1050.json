Each line is then split into tokens using the StringTokenizer class. The first token represents the access type and the second token represents the memory address. These tokens are used to create a new Trace object, which is then added to the traces list. This approach allows you to parse the trace file without loading the entire file into memory at once, which helps to avoid running out of heap space."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Reading large files for a simulation (Java crashes with out of heap space): :For a school assignment, I need to create a Simulation for memory accesses. First I need to read 1 or more trace files. Each contains memory addresses for each access. Example: 0 F001CBAD2 EEECA89F0 EBC17910...Where the first integer indicates a read/write etc. then the hex memory address follows. With this data, I am supposed to run a simulation. So the idea I had was parse these data into an ArrayList<Trace> (for now I am using Java) with trace being a simple class containing the memory address and the access type (just a String and an integer). After which I plan to loop through these array lists to process them. The problem is even at parsing, it running out of heap space. Each trace file is ~200MB. I have up  to 8. Meaning minimum of ~1.6 GB of data I am trying to \"cache\"? What baffles me is I am only parsing 1 file and java is using 2GB according to my task manager ... What is a better way of doing this? A code snippet can be found at Code Review\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
