By using the wildcard <? extends T>, the method can accept a collection of any subtype of T, allowing for greater flexibility and compatibility. This means that the method can be used with collections of different subtypes of T without needing to modify the method signature. Additionally, it ensures type safety by preventing the addition of elements that are not subtypes of T to the collection."

This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Signature of Collections.min/max method: :In Java, the Collections class contains the following method:public static <T extends Object & Comparable<? super T>> T min(Collection<? extends T> c)Its signature is well-known for its advanced use of generics,so much that it is mentioned in the Java in a Nutshell bookand in the official Sun Generics Tutorial.However, I could not find a convincing answer to the following question:Why is the formal parameter of type Collection<? extends T>, ratherthan Collection<T>? What's the added benefit?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
