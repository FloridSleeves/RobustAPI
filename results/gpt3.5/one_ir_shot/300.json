In this case, we are using it to iterate over the list of arrays and process each element in each array. This eliminates the need for recursion.\n\nAs for a better way to solve this problem, you can use the concept of permutations to generate all possible combinations. You can use a library like Apache Commons Math or write your own permutation algorithm to generate the combinations. This would allow you to handle arrays of any size and generate all possible combinations without the need for recursion."

How would a loop version of this look?Is there a better way to solve this problem?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
