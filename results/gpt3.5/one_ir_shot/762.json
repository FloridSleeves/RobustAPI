This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: PrintWriter to multiple files: :I need to write the same text to multiple files (or streams).Sometimes I need to use Writer, sometimes a PrintWriter, sometimes a OutputStream...One way to do this wold be to extend a PrintWriter to have an array of PrintWriters and overridde each method as follows:class MutiplePrintWriter extends PrintWriter {    private PrintWriter[] outs;    public MutiplePrintWriter(PrintWriter[] outs) { this.out = out; }    public void print(boolean b) { for (PrintWriter out : outs) print(b); }    public void print(char c) { for (PrintWriter out : outs) print(c); }    public void print(char[] s) { for (PrintWriter out : outs) print(s); }    ...}   (and the same for Writer, OutputStream...)Is there a better alternative?Is this already implemented in a library?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
