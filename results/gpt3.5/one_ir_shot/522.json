For each person, you can retrieve the necessary attributes (name and town in this case) and use them as keys in a nested Map structure. If the keys do not exist in the Map, you can create them and add the person to the corresponding list. This way, you can dynamically group the persons based on different attributes."

A person have some attributes like name, country, town, zipcode, etc. I wrote the static code, which works very well:Object groupedData = data.stream().collect(groupingBy(Person::getName, Collectors.groupingBy(Person::getCountry, Collectors.groupingBy(Person::getTown))));But the problem is, that is it not dynamic. Sometimes I want to just group by name and town, sometimes by a attributes. How can I do this? Non Java 8 solutions are welcome as well.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
