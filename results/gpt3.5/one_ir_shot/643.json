Then, you can modify the value as needed and use the put() method to update the value for that key in the HashMap. In this case, you can retrieve the current value for key 1 using DocsCollection.get(1), concatenate the new file name to the value, and then use DocsCollection.put(1, value) to update the value in the HashMap. This way, you can have only one entry in the HashMap and modify the value for that key."

It begins with \"1\" but when I find the word second time , the key increments and then the put method inserts a new entry with a new keyBut i would like to have only one entry and modify the key.Can this be done?How can i have only one object in a HashMap and modify the key every time?   DocsCollection.put(2,\"foo.txt,hello.txt\"); Thanks, in advance\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:"
