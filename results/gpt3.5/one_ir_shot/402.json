In your code, you are using a synchronized list, which ensures thread safety for individual operations, but it does not prevent concurrent modifications from different threads. \n\nTo fix this issue, you can use a synchronized block to ensure that the iteration and modification of the list are done atomically. Here's an updated version of your code:\n\nprivate List<IStartAction> mActions = Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList<IStartAction>());\n\nprotected void removeNonApplicableActions() {\n    synchronized (mActions) {\n        Iterator<IStartAction> iterator = mActions.iterator();\n        while (iterator.hasNext()) {\n            IStartAction action = iterator.next();\n            if (!action.isApplicable()) {\n                iterator.remove();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nBy synchronizing on the mActions list, you ensure that no other thread can modify the list while it is being iterated over, preventing the ConcurrentModificationException."
