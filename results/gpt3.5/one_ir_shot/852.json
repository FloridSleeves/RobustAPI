It returns the total number of bytes read into the buffer, or -1 if there is no more data because the end of the file has been reached. In this example, we read the audio data from the file in chunks of 1024 bytes until the end of the file is reached."

Currently the sound system I have is working (basically the same code as the top answer here), but there is a significant stall during every output (~200-300 ms). Since it's a quick game I'm looking for something significant quicker. I'm not experienced with Threads, but would those be applicable here?\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:"
