It returns null if the end of the stream has been reached. By using this method in a while loop, you can read input from System.in interactively. You can then process each line of input as needed."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Interactive Antlr: :I'm trying to write a simple interactive (using System.in as source) language using antlr, and I have a few problems with it. The examples I've found on the web are all using a per line cycle, e.g.:while(readline)  result = parse(line)  doStuff(result)But what if I'm writing something like pascal/smtp/etc, with a \"first line\" looks like X requirment? I know it can be checked in doStuff, but I think logically it is part of the syntax.Or what if a command is split into multiple lines? I can trywhile(readline)  lines.add(line)  try    result = parse(lines)    lines = []    doStuff(result)  catch    nopBut with this I'm also hiding real errors.Or I could reparse all lines everytime, but:it will be slow there are instructions I don't want to run twiceCan this be done with ANTLR, or if not, with something else?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
