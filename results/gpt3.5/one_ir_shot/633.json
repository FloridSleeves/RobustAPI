First, you need to get the model of the JTable using the getModel() method. Then, you can create a HashMap object to store your data. After adding the data to the HashMap, you can use the addRow() method of the DefaultTableModel to add the values of the HashMap as a new row to the JTable."

No, it did not help me. Yes, I am a dolt. Please don't answer with a reference to that document. What I am specifically interested in is how to dynamically add rows and columns to my Jtable via the Netbeans IDE. I already have an object that contains a hashmap with my data. I can't figure out where or what object I should be passing that object to. Thanks for your time! I have a vector that contains a series (of length l) of objects (each one corresponding to a row). How do I get that vector object to display on the JTable?\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:"
