In this case, we are using \"/\" as the delimiter. The countTokens() method returns the number of tokens in the string, which we use to initialize the size of the array. We then iterate through the tokens using the hasMoreTokens() and nextToken() methods, storing each token in the array. This approach can be faster than using the split() method, especially if you don't need to use regular expressions."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Java split String performances: :Here is the current code in my application:String[] ids = str.split(\"/\");When profiling the application, a non-negligeable time is spent string splitting. Also, the split method takes a regular expression, which is superfluous here.What alternative can I use in order to optimize the string splitting? Is StringUtils.split faster?(I would've tried and tested myself but profiling my application takes a lot of time.)\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
