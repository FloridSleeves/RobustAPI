On device A, you can create a socket and a DataOutputStream to write the data to the socket's output stream. On device B, you can create a ServerSocket and accept the incoming connection. Then, you can create a DataInputStream to read the data from the socket's input stream. The DataOutputStream.writeUTF() method is used to write a string to the output stream, and the DataInputStream.readUTF() method is used to read a string from the input stream."
