In order to use this method, you need to change your iterator declaration to `Iterator<T> iterator = iterator();` and then you can call `iterator.remove()` to remove the min item from the array."

What's the purpose?My second question is how to remove an item from this Comparable array. I have wrote the removeMin method, I have found the item, I named the variable \"min\", how do I go on and remove this min item from the arrayList? Thanks a lot!Here's some partial code:public class Bag<T extends Comparable<T>> implements Iterable<T> {    private int MAX_ITEMS = 10; // initial array size    private int size;    private Comparable[] data;    public Bag( ) {        //data = (Comparable []) new Object[MAX_ITEMS];        data = (T []) new Comparable[MAX_ITEMS];        size = 0;    }      public Comparable removeMin(){          Iterator<T> iterator=iterator();          T min = iterator.next();          while (iterator.hasNext())          {               T next = iterator.next();             if (min.compareTo(next) > 0)                 min = next;                ****************************************************                How to remove this min item?                 ****************************************************                }          return min;          }\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
