It returns -1 if the end of the stream is reached. In your code, you can modify the condition to check if the value is greater than or equal to 0, instead of just greater than 0. This will ensure that the byte value of 0 is also received by the server. As for the issue with receiving byte values of 128 or more as 65533, it is likely due to character encoding. You can try using a different character encoding, such as UTF-8, to properly handle these byte values."

If the client sends me a byte of value 0, it is not received by the server. The second issue is, if the byte value is 128 or more, I keep receiving a value of 65533 or a binary value of 11111101. Anyone knows how to solve these issues. I am a beginner in networking on JAVA.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
