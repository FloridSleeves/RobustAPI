Then, you can create a new ByteArrayInputStream using the byte array to create a new input stream that can be read again. In the example code, the image is downloaded from a URL and saved into a byte array. Then, a new ByteArrayInputStream is created using the byte array, allowing you to read the saved image again."

Is it possible to copy it somehow?I need to get a image from web, save it locally and then return the saved image. I just thought it would be faster to use the same stream instead of starting a new stream to the downloaded content and then read it again.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
