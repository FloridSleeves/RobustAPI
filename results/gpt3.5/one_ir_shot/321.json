This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Java why does no third syntax for for (each) loops exist?: :I know that currently there are two approaches to loop over an List. But let's complicate it a bit more, consider:You iterate over List<E> list.You want to keep track of an int y on every iteration.There exists a function process(E elem, int y) that processes an item.Option 1:for (int i = 0, y = 0; i < list.size(); i++, y++) {    process(list.get(i), y);}which actually just isfor (int i = 0; i < list.size(); i++) {    process(list.get(i), i);}Option 2:int y = 0;for (E elem : list) {    process(elem, y);    y++;}which can be rewritten toint y = 0;for (E elem : list) {    process(elem, y++);}However why does the following not exist? What are the objections to it not existing?Option 3:for (int y = 0; E elem : list; y++) {    process(elem, y);}Two arguments to have this construct:Both foreach syntaxes are distinguishableMany objects implement Iterable<E>, but have no for counterpart. This happens when an Iterable<E> has no order associated with it for example.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
