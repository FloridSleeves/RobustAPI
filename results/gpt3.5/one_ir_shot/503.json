The Iterator provides a safe way to remove elements from a collection while iterating over it. In the code snippet provided, we create an Iterator for the ArrayList \"pixel\" using the iterator() method. Then, we iterate over the elements using a while loop and the hasNext() method to check if there are more elements. Inside the loop, we use the next() method to get the next element and store it in the \"px\" variable. If the condition \"px.y > gHeigh\" is true, we use the remove() method of the Iterator to remove the current element from the ArrayList. This ensures that the removal is done safely without causing any ConcurrentModificationException."

Trying to remove it like in the sample code below doesn't want to work. How could I get to the iterator of current px object in this loop to remove it?    for( Pixel px : pixel){ [...]  if(px.y > gHeigh){     pixel.remove(pixel.indexOf(px)); // here is the thing     pixel.remove(px); //doesn't work either  }}\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
