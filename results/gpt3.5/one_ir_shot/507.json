You can then use the expect() and andReturn() methods to define the behavior of the mock objects. In this example, we are expecting the iterator to have two elements, so we use the hasNext() method to return true twice. We also use the next() method to return the mockItem twice. Finally, we use the hasNext() method to return false to indicate that there are no more elements in the iterator."

The issue is that the iterator returned by ItemCollection<QueryOutcome>::iterator is of type IteratorSupport, which is a package protected class. Therefore, it is impossible to mock the return type of this iterator. What can I do instead?Thanks!\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
