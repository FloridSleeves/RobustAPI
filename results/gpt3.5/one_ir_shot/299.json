It starts by creating an iterator for each list in the input list of lists. Then, it recursively generates combinations by iterating through the elements of the first iterator, adding each element to the current combination, and calling the generateCombinations method again with the remaining iterators. Once all iterators have been processed, the current combination is added to the result list. This process is repeated for each possible combination."

If you think of the Object objects as integers, you could see it like this :{{1,2},{10,20,30},{100}}I need to get all possible lists containing exactly one element of each list, that is, come up with this :{{1,10,100},{1,20,100},{1,30,100},{2,10,100},{2,20,100},{2,30,100}}Of course you don't know at compiling time how much items the lists will contain, so you cannot rely on an overlapping of for loops...How would you come up with this? Time constraints are not relevant to my problem because the lists will likely contain few elements.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
