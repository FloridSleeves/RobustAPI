Inside this method, you can use `Activity.findViewById` to initialize the `EditText` with the corresponding id. In your activity class, you can then call `setEditText` for each enum value, passing the activity instance and the id of the corresponding EditText. Finally, you can access the EditTexts using the `getEditText` method."
