The Iterator.next() method returns the next element in the iteration. We check if the item's name matches the given name and if the current room does not have an item. If both conditions are true, we add the item to the current room, remove it from the ArrayList using the Iterator.remove() method, and update the current message. If the current room already has an item, we update the current message accordingly. If none of the items match the given name, we update the current message to indicate that the player does not have that item."

Update the game\u2019s message with one of the following options: 1) the player is not holding that item, 2) the room already has an item, or 3) the player has successfully dropped the item in the room.  This is the goal of this method but when I run it it always skipps to the currentMessage in the else statement.PROBLEM:The problem I am hacing is that when I run this method and try to drop an Item in a room, it doesnt and skips to the else statement and resturns the message \"you do not have that item\", and I do not know why it is doing this and not working through the first if statement because I am typing an items name I know is in the arraylist.public void drop(String name){          for(Item count : myArray){        if(count.getName().contains(name) && currentRoom.hasItem() == false){            currentRoom.addItem(count);            currentMessage = \"you have successfully dropped the item in the room\";            myArray.remove(count);        }        else if(count.getName().contains(name) && currentRoom.hasItem() == true)        {            currentMessage = \"the room already has an item\";        }        else         {            currentMessage = \"you do not have that item\";        }    }}\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
