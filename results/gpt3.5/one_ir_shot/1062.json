Then, we create a Scanner object to read the file. We use a while loop to iterate through each line of the file. Inside the loop, we create a StringTokenizer object to tokenize each line into individual integers. We initialize a sum variable to keep track of the sum of every second integer in the line, and a count variable to keep track of the position of each integer in the line. We use the hasMoreTokens() method to check if there are more tokens in the line, and the nextToken() method to get the next token (integer). We check if the count is odd (count % 2 == 1) to determine if it is a second integer in the line, and if so, we parse the token to an integer and add it to the sum. Finally, we print the sum of every second integer in the line."

I am trying  to read a txt file which has a variable number of integers per line, and for each line I need to sum every second integer! I am using scanner to read integers, but can't work out when a line is done. Can anyone help pls?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
