This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Remove last character of a StringBuilder?: :When you have to loop through a collection and make a string of each data separated by a delimiter, you always end up with an extra delimiter at the end, e.g.for (String serverId : serverIds) {  sb.append(serverId);   sb.append(\",\");}Gives something like : serverId_1, serverId_2, serverId_3,I would like to delete the last character in the StringBuilder (without converting it because I still need it after this loop).\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
