This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Is there a conventional iterator interface in Java which separates traversal from element access?: :For my application, element access is expensive, so java.util.Iterator is no use.  I want something more like C++ iterators, where I can move the pointer around without returning an element.  Is there something in the standard library like this, or has some de facto standard interface evolved through custom?  (If not, please don't waste your time posting code snippets - I'm quite able to think up reasonable names which will do the job).  \nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
