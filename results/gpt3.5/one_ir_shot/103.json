Then, it creates a DataOutputStream to write the lines to a file. For each line, it writes the line content as bytes using the write() method, and then writes the LF character (\"\\n\") as bytes. Finally, it closes the DataOutputStream. This ensures that the output file will always use the Linux EOL character LF."

The server takes an input file from clients. Linux has end of line char LF, while Mac has end of line char CR, andWindows has end of line char CR+LFThe server needs as end of line char LF. Using java, I want to ensure that the file will always use the linux eol char LF. How can I achieve it?\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:"
