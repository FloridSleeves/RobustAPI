It compares the bytes and if they are not equal, it prints \"Bytes are not equal\" and breaks out of the loop. If the end of both files is reached and all bytes are equal, it prints \"Bytes are equal\". Finally, it closes the FileInputStream objects."

Improve this question                    can anyone write pseudocode to compare byte to byte in Java. I understand that we use read() to read byte to byte. but how do we do the comparison? \nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
