In your code, you need to replace \"Iterator\" with \"Iterator<E>\" to specify the type of elements the iterator will return. This will resolve the compilation error."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Incompatible Types, but it doesn't make sense(Java): :I'm trying to iterate through a set and I want to save the next element in a temporary variable, but it is giving me a compilation error for incompatible types. Iterator it = this.iterator();E next = it.next();next() returns a generic type E and next is of type E. Why is it giving me the error?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
