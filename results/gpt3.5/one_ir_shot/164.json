The read() method of the InputStream class reads the next byte of data from the input stream. The while loop continues until the end of the stream is reached (-1 is returned). This ensures that the parent process waits for the child process to complete before proceeding."

I have tried with runtime.exec and with processBuilder.pb: String cmd = \"ffmpeg -i input.vob output.mp4\" Runtime rt = Runtime.getRuntime();Process proc = rt.exec(cmd); proc.waitFor();This works fine with small input file (say less than 10 Mb). If I give larger input file then program will be hanged. Output file will be partially created and file creation will be hanged and control will not return. Even proc.join(10000); did not give any useful result. Here parent process is terminating before child process (ffmpeg) gets completed.How to overcome this problem?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
