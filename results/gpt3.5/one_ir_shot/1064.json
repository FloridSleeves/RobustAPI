I'm new to java reading from files, and I don't know how to work with just some parts of what I readHere is the initial file: http://pastebin.com/D0paWtAdAnd I have to write in another file the following output:Average,Joe,44,31,18,12,9,10I've managed just to take everything from the file and print it to output. I would need help just in taking the output I need and print it to the screen.
