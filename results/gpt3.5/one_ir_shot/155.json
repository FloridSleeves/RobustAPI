It returns -1 if the end of the stream is reached. In the provided code, it is used to read the output of the process. The available() method returns an estimate of the number of bytes that can be read from the input stream without blocking. It is used in the while loop to read all available bytes from the input stream. The write() method of the OutputStream class writes the specified byte array to the output stream. The flush() method flushes the output stream and forces any buffered output bytes to be written out. The close() method closes the output stream. In the provided code, it is used to write the command to the process and close the output stream."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Issue with a Process Object of Java: :I have a problem with a Process Object of Java.I want to open the process called linphonec.exe to make calls, and inside this process I have to insert a few command lines to do calls, answer ...The problem comes when I have to insert more than one command line because the OutputStream of Process only accepts a command line when I call the close() method of OutputStream. If I dont call this method the command line isn't executed.I want to execute more than one command but I can't.Example:\"Call phone\" and then \"terminate\" to end the call whenever I want. But I can only insert the first command line and if I dont use the close() method the command line is not executed.Code:Start a process:ProcessBuilder builder = new ProcessBuilder(PROCESS);builder.redirectErrorStream(true);Process p = builder.start();Read the InputStream of Process:InputStream i = p.getInputStream();System.out.print((char)i.read());while(i.available() > 0){    System.out.print((char)i.read());}Insert command line into OutputStream:String command = com.nextLine();OutputStream o = p.getOutputStream();o.write(comando.getBytes());o.flush();o.close();If I delete \"o.close()\" the command line is not executed, but if I execute it I can't execute the other command lines.I tried the code on my program, but when I insert the command line I dont see the next information of the process.When I put your code :ReadyWarning: video is disabled in linphonec, use -V or -C or -D to enable.linphonec> Registration on sip:XX.XX.XX.XX successful.linphonec> call XXXExemple with my code:ReadyWarning: video is disabled in linphonec, use -V or -C or -D to enable.linphonec> Registration on sip:XX.XX.XX.XX successful.linphonec> call XXXEstablishing call id to sip:XXX@XX.XX.XX.XX, assigned id 1With \"Available > 0\" I get \"Establishing call id to sip:XXX@XX.XX.XX.XX, assigned id 1\".If I use this loop I dont see the other info of the process.I think the problem is that the outputstream does not get the command lines until I execute the Close method.Thank you.Sorry for my bad englando.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
