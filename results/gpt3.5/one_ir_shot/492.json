When writing to the map, you can synchronize on the map itself to prevent concurrent modifications. When reading the entire map, you can also synchronize on the map and use an iterator to iterate over the entries. This ensures that no concurrent modifications occur while reading. Additionally, you can override the removeEldestEntry method to limit the size of the map to 50 entries and preserve the order."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: thread safe LinkedHashMap without Collections.synchronized: :I am using a LinkedHashMap and the environment is multi threaded so this structure needs to be thread safe. During specific events I need to read the entire map push to db and clear all. Most of time only writes happen to this map. This map has a limit 50 entries.I am using Oracle MAF and it does not have Collections.syncronizedMap available. So, what are things I need to put in synchronized blocks to make sure writing and reading doesn't hit me concurrentModificationException etcFew requirements:I need to behave it like a circular queue so Overriding removeEldestEntry method of the LinkedHashMap. I need to preserve the order\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
