In this case, we are using the default delimiter which is whitespace. We can then use the nextToken() method to retrieve the next token from the string. In this example, we first retrieve the first name token and assign it to the firstName variable. Then, we retrieve the number token and assign it to the numberString variable. Finally, we parse the numberString into a double using the Double.parseDouble() method to get the desired number variable."

I tried using the Double.parseDouble(name); method, but when it runs, it doesn't work right. What should I use?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
