To handle exceptions on the individual next() calls, you can wrap the code inside the foreach loop with a try-catch block. This way, any exception thrown by the next() method will be caught and you can handle it accordingly."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Exception handling in Iterable: :Is there any way of handling -- and continuing from -- an exception in an iterator while maintaining the foreach syntactic sugar?I've got a parser that iterates over lines in a file, handing back a class-per-line.  Occasionally lines will be syntactically bogus, but that doesn't necessarily mean that we shouldn't keep reading the file.My parser implements Iterable, but dealing with the potential exceptions means writingfor (Iterator iter = myParser.iterator(); iter.hasNext(); ) {  try {    MyClass myClass = iter.next();    // .. do stuff ..  } catch (Exception e) {    // .. do exception stuff ..  }}.. nothing wrong with that, but is there any way of getting exception handling on the implicit individual iter.next() calls in the foreach construct?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
