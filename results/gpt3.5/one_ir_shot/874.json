To get the strings from the file and show them in the app, you can use the SQLiteDatabase.query method to query the database and retrieve the data.\n\nHere is an example code snippet:\n\n1. Put the SQL file in the assets folder of your project.\n\n2. In your Java code, create an instance of SQLiteDatabase and open the database:\n\n   SQLiteDatabase db = SQLiteDatabase.openDatabase(\"path/to/your/database.db\", null, SQLiteDatabase.OPEN_READONLY);\n\n3. Use the query method to retrieve the data from the database:\n\n   Cursor cursor = db.query(\"your_table_name\", null, null, null, null, null, null);\n\n4. Iterate over the cursor to get the strings from the file:\n\n   List<String> strings = new ArrayList<>();\n   while (cursor.moveToNext()) {\n       String string = cursor.getString(cursor.getColumnIndex(\"column_name\"));\n       strings.add(string);\n   }\n\n5. Show the strings in your app, for example, in a ListView:\n\n   ArrayAdapter<String> adapter = new ArrayAdapter<>(this, android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1, strings);\n   listView.setAdapter(adapter);\n\n6. Close the cursor and the database when you're done:\n\n   cursor.close();\n   db.close();\n\n<<<explanation>>>: By including the SQL file in the assets folder of your project, you can access it using the SQLiteDatabase.openDatabase method. Then, you can use the SQLiteDatabase.query method to retrieve the data from the database and show it in your app."
