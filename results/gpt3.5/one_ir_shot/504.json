It then iterates through the scores array and adds the positions to the corresponding score in the map. \n\nNext, it creates an array called ranking to store the rankings. It starts with rank 1 and iterates from the highest score to the lowest score. For each score, it checks if it exists in the scoreMap. If it does, it retrieves the positions and assigns the current rank to each position in the ranking array. The rank is then incremented by the number of positions.\n\nThis approach handles cases where there are multiple players with the same score by assigning the same rank to all of them and incrementing the rank accordingly."

I want to get another array that gives me the ranking of the players based on their scores.For example: Given the scores {10,20,15,40}I want the ranking to be {4,2,3,1}The lowest score being rank 4 and the highest score being rank 1.The biggest problem is when there are multiple players with the same score. For example {10,10,20,40} then I want to get {34,34,2,1} (34 because the third and fourth place are shared by two players)Another example is {40,40,10,20}, which should give the ranking {12,12,4,3} (12 for shared first and second place)I have for the moment two dubble arrays to come to that result, but I think it can be better, but I don't find how. My biggest problem now is when we have 3 same scores: {40,40,40,10} than I should have the result {123,123,123,4}I hope you understand my question and of course can help me to find a solution.thanks\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
