In this code, we first get the length of the file using the length() method. Then, we iterate from the end of the file to the start using a pointer variable. Inside the loop, we use the seek() method to set the file pointer to the current position, and then use the read() method to read a single character at that position. We append each character to a StringBuilder in reverse order. Finally, we reverse the StringBuilder and convert it to a String to get the reversed content of the file."
