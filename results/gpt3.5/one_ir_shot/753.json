The main method calls these methods in a logical order. The readFromFile method reads the content of the text file and populates the dictionary ArrayList. The createDictionary method removes duplicates from the dictionary and sorts it alphabetically. The writeToFile method writes the contents of the tempdictionary ArrayList to the output file. This approach improves code readability, maintainability, and adheres to the principles of good object-oriented programming practice."

I managed to do the below, which works, but it has raised some questions/fundamental gaps in my knowledge. I  believe that based on the principles of good O.O. programming practice, I should break the below down into a series of methods that have a single purpose, and then call those methods. However, I really struggle doing this. Can anyone please elaborate/advise a way to improve on that specific point? Or correct me if I'm wrong? public class Main{    private static ArrayList<String> dictionary;     private static ArrayList<String> tempdictionary;    public static void main() throws FileNotFoundException    {        Scanner inFile = new Scanner(new FileReader(\"H:\\\\csc8001\\\\results.txt\"));        dictionary = new ArrayList <>();        tempdictionary = new ArrayList <>();        while (inFile.hasNext()) {             dictionary.add(inFile.next().toLowerCase().replaceAll(\"[^a-zA-Z ]\", \"\"));        }        inFile.close();        PrintWriter outFile = new PrintWriter(\"H:\\\\csc8001\\\\results1.txt\");        int index = 0;        for (String a : dictionary)        {            if (!tempdictionary.contains(a)){                 tempdictionary.add(a);            } else {                index++;            }        }        Collections.sort(tempdictionary);        for (int i=0; i<tempdictionary.size(); i++)            outFile.println(tempdictionary.get(i));        outFile.flush();        outFile.close();    }}\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
