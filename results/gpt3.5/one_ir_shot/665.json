When you close the PrintWriter object, it also closes the underlying output stream, which in turn closes the socket. This is why the subsequent read operation fails. To only close the output stream channel and keep the socket alive, you can use the socket's shutdownOutput() method, which only closes the output stream channel."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Behavior of Java sockets when closing output stream: :Can someone explain the following behavior in Java sockets:The general idea is this:Open socket, Obtain I/O streams.Write request, Close out streamRead Response, Close in streamClose socket.Here's my question / issue.If I use a PrintWriter for output, and then close it, It closes the whole socket, and the subsequent read operation fails miserably.Instead if I directly use the socket's shutdownOutput() method, it correctly closes the output stream channel, while keeping the socket alive.Why would closing the PrintWriter object take the whole socket down with it?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
