The dummy byte and number of files can be read using the readByte() method."

This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Resource file format processing in Java: :I am trying to implement a processor for a specific resource archive file format in Java. The format has a Header comprised of a three-char description, a dummy byte, plus a byte indicating the number of files. Then each file has an entry consisting of a dummy byte, a twelve-char string describing the file name, a dummy byte, and an offset declared in a three-byte array. What would be the proper class for reading this kind of structure? I have tried RandomAccessFile but it does not allow to read arrays of data, e.g. I can only read three chars by calling readChar() three times, etc.Of course I can extend RandomAccessFile to do what I want but there's got to be a proper out-of-the-box class to do this kind of processing isn't it?This is my reader for the header in C#:protected override void ReadHeader(){    Header = new string(this.BinaryReader.ReadChars(3));    byte dummy = this.BinaryReader.ReadByte();    NFiles = this.BinaryReader.ReadByte();}\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:"
