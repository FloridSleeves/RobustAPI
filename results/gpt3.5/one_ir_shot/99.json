First, create a FileInputStream to read the image data from the input file. Then, create a DataOutputStream with a FileOutputStream to write the header and image data to the output file. Write the specific header bytes using the write() method of DataOutputStream. Then, read the image data bytes from the input file in chunks and write them to the output file using the write() method of DataOutputStream. Finally, close the FileInputStream and DataOutputStream to release resources."

The TIFF header has been replace by a specific one but the image bytes are exactly the same as in a TIFF file.EDIT :Thanks to haraldK, I can finally create a TIFF header. But I can't open the image, maybe it is because of the compression : \"M2 = Modified Read Code II (MRII), i.e., fax group 4\". Here is the header that I created :SubFileType (1 Long): ZeroImageWidth (1 Long): 210ImageLength (1 Long): 297BitsPerSample (3 Short): 8, 8, 8Compression (1 Short): Group 4 Fax (aka CCITT FAX4)Photometric (1 Short): RGBStripOffsets (1 Long): 306SamplesPerPixel (1 Short): 3RowsPerStrip (1 Short): 297StripByteCounts (1 Long): 187110ResolutionUnit (1 Short): NoneXResolution (72 Rational): YResolution (1 Rational): Unexpected numericDateTime (20 ASCII): 2014:07:12 10:51:51 Software (28 ASCII): Put your software name here ImageDescription (30 ASCII): Put an image description here Should I uncompress the image data before merging the header and the image data ?\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:"
