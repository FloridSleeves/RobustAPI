This means that you can only generify a class using T extends Something, not T super Something. In your case, since you want to generify the class MyIterator to accept any type that is a superclass of Maple, you can use T extends Tree instead. This will allow you to use the Iterator.next method to return objects of type T, which in this case will always be Maples. However, you will need to cast the returned object to type T in order to satisfy the return type of the method."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Generifying with \"super\": :I would like to write an Interator like this:class Plant { }class Tree extends Plant { }class Maple extends Tree { }// Iterator class: compiler error on the word \"super\".class MyIterator<T super Maple> implements Iterator<T> {    private int index = 0;    private List<Maple> list = // Get the list from an external source.    public T next() {         Maple maple = list.get(index++);         // Do some processing.         return maple;    }    // The other methods of Iterator are easy to implement.}Conceptually, the idea is to have an iterator that looks like it returns Trees or Plants (even though they are always Maples) without writing separate classes for each.But the compiler doesn't like it when I generify with T super Maple; apparently you can only generify a class using T extends Something. Does anyone know of a good way to accomplish the same thing?My motivation for asking is that I have a program that uses interfaces for its API. I want to have one method that returns an iterator of interfaces (for the API) and another that returns an iterator of the implementation classes (for internal use).\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
