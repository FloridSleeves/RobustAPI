The default iterator returned by the Iterable.iterator() method will be used by the for-each loop. In the example above, the Polygon class implements Iterable<Vertex> and provides two custom iterators: PolygonIterator for running through all elements just once, and CyclicPolygonIterator for running through elements cyclically. The for-each loop can be used with the default iterator, while the cyclicIterator() method can be used to obtain the cyclic iterator for a specific use case."

Is this correct? Or is there a way I could use for-each with both?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
