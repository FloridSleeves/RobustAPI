Here are some steps you can follow:\n\n1. Implement authentication: You can use a token-based authentication mechanism such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or OAuth. When a user logs in, generate a token and send it back to the client. The client should include this token in subsequent requests to authenticate the user.\n\n2. Implement authorization: Once the user is authenticated, you can implement authorization to control access to different resources or endpoints. You can use role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC) to define the permissions for each user or role.\n\n3. Use HTTPS: Ensure that your web service is accessed over HTTPS instead of HTTP. This will encrypt the communication between the client and the server, making it more secure.\n\n4. Validate input: Always validate the input received from the client to prevent any security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. You can use libraries like OWASP Java Encoder or Hibernate Validator for input validation.\n\n5. Implement rate limiting: To prevent abuse or denial of service attacks, you can implement rate limiting to restrict the number of requests a client can make within a certain time period.\n\n6. Monitor and log: Implement logging and monitoring mechanisms to track any suspicious activities or potential security breaches. This will help you identify and respond to security incidents in a timely manner.\n\nRemember that security is an ongoing process, and it's important to stay updated with the latest security best practices and vulnerabilities."
