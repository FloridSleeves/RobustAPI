By doing so, the LinkedList class itself is acting as an iterator for the elements in the linked list. The iterator() method is overridden to return the instance of the LinkedList class itself, which means the LinkedList object can be used as an iterator.\n\nThe hasNext() method is implemented to check if there is a next element in the linked list. The next() method is implemented to return the next element in the linked list and move the current pointer to the next node. The remove() method is implemented to throw an UnsupportedOperationException, indicating that the remove operation is not supported in this implementation.\n\nSo, in this case, the iterator() method is not returning a separate inner class implementing the Iterator interface. Instead, the LinkedList class itself is acting as an iterator by implementing the required methods of the Iterator interface."

This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Java: Implement own Linked LIst -> Where to define hasNext(), next(), remove()?: :HOMEWORK: Please guide me help guide me without posting complete codeMy instructor is having us implement a LinkedList as a homework assignment. Here is the header for the shell of the class:public class LinkedList<T> implements Iterable<T>, Iterator<T>Note he is implementing the Iterable and Iterator interfaces. I then understand that I need to implement an iterator(), hasNext(), next(), and remove() methods in my class. What confuses me though is that he does not put the methods required for the Iterator interface in a separate inner class. All of the methods below are defined in the LinkedList class:/* * (non-Javadoc) *  * @see java.lang.Iterable#iterator() */@Overridepublic Iterator<T> iterator(){    return null;}/* * (non-Javadoc) *  * @see java.util.Iterator#hasNext() */@Overridepublic boolean hasNext(){    return false;}/* * (non-Javadoc) *  * @see java.util.Iterator#next() */@Overridepublic T next(){    return null;}/* * (non-Javadoc) *  * @see java.util.Iterator#remove() */@Overridepublic void remove(){}Shouldn't the iterator() method be returning something like:public Iterator<T> iterator(){    return new MyClassIterator(front);}Where MyClassIterator() is defined with the hasNext(), next(), and remove() methods. What am I missing?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
