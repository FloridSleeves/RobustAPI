It returns -1 if the end of the stream is reached. In this code, we create an InputStream from the output stream of the SSH channel and read the data into a buffer. We then append the data to a StringBuilder until the end of the stream is reached. Finally, we convert the StringBuilder to a String and close the channel and session."

For example, this one doesn't show code for handling the output stream. And, this one uses an ugly hack to know when to stop reading from the output stream.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
