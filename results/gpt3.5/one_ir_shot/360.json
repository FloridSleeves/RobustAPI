However, since the type of the element returned by the Iterator is Object, you need to cast it to the appropriate type before assigning it to a variable of that type. In this case, you need to cast it to Map.Entry because you are iterating over a HashMap, which stores key-value pairs as Map.Entry objects."

Why can't I have just Map.Entry m = i.next();?Sorry. It is a HashMap.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
