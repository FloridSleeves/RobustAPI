This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Java create InputStream from ZipInputStream entry: :I would like to write a method that read several XML files inside a ZIP, from a single InputStream.The method would open a ZipInputStream, and on each xml file, get the corresponding InputStream, and give it to my XML parser. Here is the skeleton of the method : private void readZip(InputStream is) throws IOException {    ZipInputStream zis = new ZipInputStream(is);    ZipEntry entry = zis.getNextEntry();    while (entry != null) {        if (entry.getName().endsWith(\".xml\")) {            // READ THE STREAM        }        entry = zis.getNextEntry();    }}The problematic part is the \"// READ THE STREAM\". I have a working solution, which consist to create a ByteArrayInputStream, and feed my parser with it. But it uses a buffer, and for large files I get an OutOfMemoryError. Here is the code, if someone is still interested :int count;byte buffer[] = new byte[2048];ByteArrayOutputStream out = new ByteArrayOutputStream();while ((count = zis.read(buffer)) != -1) { out.write(buffer, 0, count); }       InputStream is = new ByteArrayInputStream(out.toByteArray());The ideal solution would be to feed the parser with the original ZipInputStream. It should works, because it works if I just print the entry content with a Scanner :Scanner sc = new Scanner(zis);while (sc.hasNextLine()){    System.out.println(sc.nextLine());}But... The parser I'm currently using (jdom2, but I also tried with javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory) closes the stream after parsing the data :/ . So I'm unable to get the next entry and continue.So finally the question is :Does anybody know a DOM parser that doesn't close its stream ?Is there another way to have an InputStream from a ZipEntry ?Thanks.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
