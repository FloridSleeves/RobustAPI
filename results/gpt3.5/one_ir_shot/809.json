To implement an autocompleting input field in Spring 3 with LDAP as the data source, you would need to use a combination of Spring LDAP and JQuery.\n\nHere is a general outline of the steps you would need to follow:\n\n1. Configure Spring LDAP: Set up the necessary configuration for connecting to your LDAP server in your Spring configuration file.\n\n2. Create a Spring Controller: Create a controller class in your Spring application that handles the requests for autocompletion. This controller should use Spring LDAP to query the LDAP server for the suggested values.\n\n3. Implement the Autocomplete Logic: In your controller, implement the logic to query the LDAP server and retrieve the suggested values based on the user's input. You can use the Spring LDAP API to perform the LDAP search and retrieve the results.\n\n4. Return the Suggested Values: Once you have retrieved the suggested values from the LDAP server, you can return them to the client-side using JSON format. You can use the @ResponseBody annotation in your controller method to automatically convert the Java objects to JSON.\n\n5. Implement the Client-side Autocomplete: On the client-side, you can use JQuery to implement the autocomplete functionality. You can make an AJAX request to the server-side controller to retrieve the suggested values and then use JQuery's autocomplete plugin to display the suggestions in the input field.\n\nPlease note that this is a high-level overview and there are many details that need to be considered and implemented. It would be best to refer to the Spring LDAP documentation and JQuery documentation for more detailed instructions and examples."

I have found some examples with data txt.files, but not ldap.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
