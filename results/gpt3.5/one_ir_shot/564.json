In fact, it can be a good practice to provide an iterator to allow controlled access to the elements of the private List without exposing the underlying implementation details. The Iterator.next() method returns the next element in the iteration.\n<<<explanation>>>: By returning an iterator, you are providing a way for other classes to iterate over the elements of the private List in a controlled manner. This allows for encapsulation, as the internal implementation of the List can be hidden while still providing access to its elements. It also allows for flexibility, as you can change the underlying implementation of the List without affecting the classes that use the iterator."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Is returning an iterator of private List (in class) considered bad practice?: :Suppose I have two classes: Animal and Zoo, which has private List containing instances of Animal. Reason why I want to return iterator is to avoid defining setters and getters and removal methods. Does that break encapsulation?class Zoo{    private List<Animal> animalList;    public Zoo(){        animalList = new ArrayList<Animal>();    }    public void addAnimal(Animal animal){        animalList.add(animal);    }    public Iterator<Animal> iterator(){        return animalList.iterator();    }}class Animal{    private String name;    private double weight, height;    Animal(String name, double weight, double height){        this.name = name;        this.weight = weight;        this.height = height;    }}\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
