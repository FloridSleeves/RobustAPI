By comparing each element using the equals() method, you can determine if the lists differ. If the lists have different sizes or if there are elements remaining in either iterator after the loop, it means the lists differ."

I don't care what's the difference, I just want to know if they're not the same.I'm fetching scores list from a database every minute, and only if the scores list that I fetched is different from the one I fetched a minute ago I want to send it to the client.Now the value of the ArrayList is actually a class that I created (that contains name, lvl, rank, score).Do I need to implement equals() on it?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
