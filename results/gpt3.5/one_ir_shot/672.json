The problem I have now is that the txt file highscores.txt isn't found anywhere because I haven't created it. Is it possible to have the file created whenever it isn't found? Here is the relevant code:Write highscores to file at gameover: if(gameOver == true){        sbg.enterState(5, new FadeOutTransition(), new FadeInTransition());        if(score > Highscores.highscore3 && score < Highscores.highscore2){            Highscores.highscore3 = score;        }else if(score > Highscores.highscore2 && score < Highscores.highscore1){            Highscores.highscore3 = Highscores.highscore2;            Highscores.highscore2 = score;          }else if(score > Highscores.highscore1){            Highscores.highscore3 = Highscores.highscore2;            Highscores.highscore2 = Highscores.highscore1;            Highscores.highscore1 = score;        }else Highscores.highscore1 = score;        //Write highscores to highscores.txt        try{            PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"highscores.txt\", \"UTF-8\");            writer.println(String.valueOf(Highscores.highscore1));            writer.println(String.valueOf(Highscores.highscore1));            writer.println(String.valueOf(Highscores.highscore1));            writer.close();        }catch(Exception e){            e.printStackTrace();        }        gameOver = false;        gameStart = false;    }Read highscores from highscores.txt at program start:public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException{    BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"highscores.txt\"));    String line;    while((line = in.readLine()) != null){        System.out.println(line);    }    in.close();I know that I can create a file if it doesn't exist like this:try{File save = new File(\"highscores.txt\");if (!save.exists()){    save.createNewFile();System.out.println(\"\\n----------------------------------\");System.out.println(\"The file has been created.\");System.out.println(\"------------------------------------\");}But I don't know how to do that with buffers.
