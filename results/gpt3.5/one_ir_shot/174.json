It then gets the input stream of the process using getInputStream() and creates a BufferedReader to read the output line by line. The readLine() method reads a line of text from the input stream, and the while loop continues until there are no more lines to read. Each line is then printed to the console using System.out.println()."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Redirect process output to stdout: :I would like to execute foo.bat from within a Groovy program and have the resulting process' output redirected to stdout. Either a Java or Groovy code example would be fine.foo.bat can take several minutes to run and generates a lot of output, so I would like to see the output as soon as it is generated, rather than having to wait until the process has completed before seeing all the output at once.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
