In this case, we are using a space (\" \") as the delimiter. We iterate through each token and check if it contains the specified tags (\"-PRP\" and \"PRP\"). If it does not contain these tags, we append it to the output StringBuilder. Finally, we convert the StringBuilder to a String and trim any extra spaces."
