Then, we create an Iterator object called \"iterator\" by calling the iterator() method on the collection. The iterator allows us to iterate over the elements in the collection.\n\nThe while loop is used to iterate through the collection. The condition \"iterator.hasNext()\" checks if there are more elements in the collection. If there are, the loop continues. Inside the loop, we use the \"iterator.next()\" method to get the next element in the collection and assign it to the reference variable \"t\". Finally, we print the transaction using StdOut.println(t).\n\nSo, the code is looping through the collection and printing each transaction in the queue. The iterator.next() method returns the next element in the collection, and the loop continues until there are no more elements."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Iteration through data structures(queue, stacks, bags): :Queue<Transaction> collection = new Queue<Transaction>andfor(Transaction t: collection){ StdOut.println(t); }From my understanding of objects, it looks like we just created an object, the queue, of datatype transaction(type parameter) and collection is the reference to that object. Correct? Then the second bit of code is what confuses me. We are looping to print whats in the queue but i'm not sure i understand how this works. collection points to the Queue of type Transaction. It looks like we are creating a reference t to the object Transaction and doing something with it to the reference collection. Pretty confused.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
