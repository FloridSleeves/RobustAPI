Then, it creates an empty result list and an iterator for the letters list. It iterates through the letters using the iterator and adds each letter to the result list. It then removes the letter from the original list and continues adding the letter to the result list as long as it appears in the original list. Finally, it joins the letters in the result list into a single string. This approach ensures that the letters are grouped together based on their first appearance in the input string."

This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Order Strings by apperance in Java: :I have a list of string that have already been arranged according to a numeric value.Now I would like to group these strings in the following way.Lets say I have a text file that looks like this:dbcebcdeddacbebcdacedbcdaAnd I would like to order it in a way that would end up like this:dbcdacebebceddedbcdcdaacbSo as you can see it has to group by the letter of the string and stack em together. What would be the most efficient way of accomplishing this task?UPDATE.As you can see the desired order is not alphabetical, that includes reverse. As I mentioned the objective is to group the strings and order them by first appearance. For this example I am using letter to simplify a (lot) more complex problem I am trying to solve. The thing to concentrate with here is the order on which the letter of each string appear. Grouping in a specific order, rather than ordering.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
