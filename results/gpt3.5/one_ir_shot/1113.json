In this case, we are using the double quote (\") as the delimiter. We iterate through the tokens and add them to a list if they are not empty. This will give us the words between the quotes."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: how to get data between quotes in java?: :I have this lines of text the number of quotes could change  like: Here just one \"comillas\"But I also could have more \"mas\" values in \"comillas\" and that \"is\" the \"trick\"I was thinking in a method that return \"a\" list of \"words\" that \"are\" between \"comillas\"How I obtain the data between the quotes? The result should be:  comillasmas, comillas, tricka, words, are, comillas  \nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
