In this case, it seems like you are trying to import the Violin class from the ViolinGonzalezAP3 class, but you forgot to include the outer class name when referencing the inner class. To fix this, you need to include the outer class name before the inner class name, like this: ViolinGonzalezAP3.Violin."

I am working with 2 files. One defines a class and all of it's methods and another constructs an instance of this class.
