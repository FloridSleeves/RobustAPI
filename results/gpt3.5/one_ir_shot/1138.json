In this case, we use a comma as the delimiter. We create three separate arrays to store the words from the line, and then use the nextToken() method to retrieve each word and store it in the respective array. The trim() method is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from each word."

For example if the line in the file wasDog, blue, largeThen I would like to have 3 different arrays that store one word from the list. So would array 1 would store Dog, array 2 stores blue, and array 3 stores large.Thanks \nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
