Then, you can use the writeInt() method of DataOutputStream to write an int value and the write() method to write a byte array. Finally, you can call the toByteArray() method of ByteArrayOutputStream to get the resulting byte array."

This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to use ByteArrayOutputStream and DataOutputStream simultaneously in Java?: :I'm having quite a problem here, and I think it is because I don't understand very much how I should use the API provided by Java.I need to write an int and a byte[] into a byte[].I thought of using a DataOutputStream to solve the data writing with writeInt(int i) and write(byte[] b), and to be able to put that into a byte array, I should use ByteArrayOutputStream method toByteArray().I understand that this classes use the Wrapper pattern, so I had two options:DataOutputStream w = new DataOutputStream(new ByteArrayOutputStream());orByteArrayOutputStream w = new ByteArrayOutputStream(new DataOutputStream());but in both cases, I \"loose\" a method. in the first case, I can't access the toByteArray() method, and in the second, I can't access the writeInt() method.How should I use this classes together?\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:"
