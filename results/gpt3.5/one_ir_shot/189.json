The reason is because I do not have '\\n' at the end of the last sentence but my method adds  numChars += line.length() + 1;However, I cannot find a solution to why I get 0 for words and lines.*My texts includes elements as: ? , - 'After all, could anyone help me to make this work? **So far, I the problem that concerns me is how I can get a number of characters, if the last sentence does not have '\\n' element. Is there a chance I could fix that with an if statement? -Thank you!\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
