If you want to write data to a RandomAccessFile, you can use the write() method of the RandomAccessFile class. Here is an example:\n\nRandomAccessFile file = new RandomAccessFile(\"file.txt\", \"rw\");\nfile.writeInt(123);\nfile.writeBytes(\"Hello\");\nfile.writeDouble(3.14);\nfile.close();\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The write() method writes a specified value to the file. In the example above, we write an integer, a string, and a double to the file. The \"rw\" parameter in the RandomAccessFile constructor specifies that the file should be opened for both reading and writing."
