In the code provided, we create a nested loop to iterate over each element of the board array. Inside the loop, we use the read() method to read a single byte from the input stream and cast it to a char before assigning it to the corresponding element in the board array. This allows you to receive the 2-dimensional char array over the socket connection."

I have the \"board\" stored as a 2 dimensional char array. I want to be able to send and receive this array through Sockets. I am currently using a InputStream and OutputStream to send single bytes. However, I don't think this will work for sending the array. Also, these streams only seem capable of sending int type data. Can someone please explain to me how too send 2 dimensional char arrays over sockets using I/O streams. Example code would be great! Thanks. Current Code:public void communicate() {    try {        OutputStream os = client.getOutputStream();        InputStream is = client.getInputStream();    }    while (gameOver == false) {        char[][] board = new char[3][3];        try {            os.write(board); //this dosen't work, only sends non-array int types.         } catch (IOException e) {            e.printStackTrace();        }    }}\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
