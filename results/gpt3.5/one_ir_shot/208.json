It returns an int value representing the byte read, or -1 if the end of the stream is reached. To convert the byte read into a hexadecimal string representation, you can use the String.format() method with the \"%02X\" format specifier. This specifier formats the integer as a hexadecimal string with a minimum width of 2 characters, padding with leading zeros if necessary."

This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Read Java in as Hex: :I have tried to solve this but I keep coming up with stuff that is no help I'm sure this is easy (when you know how of course ;) ) What I would like to do is read in a file using a byte stream like below:while((read = in.read()) != -1){       //code removed to save space       Integer.toHexString(read);System.out.println(read);}When it prints out the Hex to the screen it will print out numbers fine e.g 3113120but when it comes to a hex code that should be 01 31 it will print 0 131. I want to read it in to a variable like you would see in a hex editor i.e 00 11 21 31 no single numbers as i need to scan the whole file and look for patterns which I know how to do I'm just stuck on this :/so in short i need a variabe to contain the two hex characters i.e int temp = 01 not int temp = 0 , I hope this all makes sense, I'm a little confused as it's 3am!If anyone knows how to do this I would be most greatful, p.s thanks for the help in advance this site has saved me loads of research and have learnt a lot!Many thanks.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
