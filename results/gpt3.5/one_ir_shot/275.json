I am trying to make it so that if the enemies are within a certain distance of the ammos, then the enemys remove themselves from the screen. I have attempted to do it and the code compiles, but i am unsure why the enemys arent being removed from the screen once been hit. Can anyone see anything wrong with the code below? Thankyoufor (TopEnemy i : newTopEnemy){    for (int q = 0; q < ammo.length; q++)    {       float xsubs = i.enemyX - ammo[q].positionX;       float ysubs = i.enemyY - ammo[q].positionY;       float squared = (xsubs * xsubs) + (ysubs * ysubs);       float distance = (float)Math.sqrt(squared);       if (distance < 10.0)       {          newTopEnemy.remove(q);       }    } }  \nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
