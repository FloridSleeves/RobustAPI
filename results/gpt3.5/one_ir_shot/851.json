First, create a RandomAccessFile object with the file you want to truncate and the \"rw\" mode. Then, use the setLength() method to set the length of the file to 0, effectively truncating it."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: File truncate operation in Java: :What is the best-practice way to truncate a file in Java? For example this dummy function, just as an example to clarify the intent:void readAndTruncate(File f, List<String> lines)        throws FileNotFoundException {    for (Scanner s = new Scanner(f); s.hasNextLine(); lines.add(s.nextLine())) {}    // truncate f here! how?}The file can not be deleted since the file is acting as a place holder.\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:"
