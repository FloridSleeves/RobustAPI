You can check if the file already exists using the exists() method.\n- To write strings to the file, you can use the PrintWriter class. Create a new PrintWriter object with a FileWriter object as its parameter, passing the file name. Use the println() method to write each string to the file.\n- To read strings from the file, you can use various methods such as FileReader, BufferedReader, or Scanner. Since the question is not about reading from the file, the code for reading and inserting into the array is omitted here."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Working with files in java: :I have an array of strings.I want to save those strings in a file.The problem is, I need to make a new file called db.txt (only if it doesn't exist),then somehow write strings to it.And then later I want to be able to read strings from that file and insert them to the array.Inserting and using array is not the question, but the question is how do I mess with the files? How do I create a new text file (if not existing already), how do I write to it and how do I read from it? Tried to learn it by myself but I've seen so many ways on the Internet and got confused.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
