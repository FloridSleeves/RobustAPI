Inside the loop, you can check the elapsed time and break out of the loop if the specified time is reached. This way, you have more control over the iteration and can stop it after a specific time."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: What is the best way to break out of iteration after a specific time?: :I am iterating over an Iterator, where hasNext() will never return false. However, after a specified time (let's say 20 seconds), I want to stop iterating. The problem is that the next() method of the Iterator is blocking, but even so, after a specified time, I just need the iteration to stop.Here is my example Iterable and Iterator to simulate my problem.public class EndlessIterable implements Iterable<String> {    static class EndlessIterator implements Iterator<String> {         public boolean hasNext() { return true; }         public String next() {              return \"\" + System.currentTimeMillis(); //in reality, this code does some long running task, so it's blocking         }    }   public Iterator<String> iterator() { return new EndlessIterator(); }}Here is my code to test.EndlessIterable iterable = new EndlessIterable();for(String s : iterable) { System.out.println(s); }I wanted to put code/logic into the Iterable class to create a Timer, so after the specified time is up, an exception will be thrown so as to stop the iteration. public class EndlessIterable implements Iterable<String> {    static class EndlessIterator implements Iterator<String> {        public boolean hasNext() { return true; }        public String next() {             try { Thread.sleep(2000); } catch(Exception) { } //just sleep for a while            return \"\" + System.currentTimeMillis(); //in reality, this code does some long running task, so it's blocking        }    }    static class ThrowableTimerTask extends TimerTask {        private Timer timer;        public ThrowableTimerTask(Timer timer) { this.timer = timer; }        public void run() {            this.timer.cancel();            throw new RuntimeException(\"out of time!\");        }    }    private Timer timer;    private long maxTime = 20000; //20 seconds    public EndlessIterable(long maxTime) {        this.maxTime = maxTime;        this.timer = new Timer(true);    }    public Iterator<String> iterator() {         this.timer.schedule(new ThrowableTimerTask(this.timer), maxTime, maxTime);        return new EndlessIterator();    }}I then try to test this code as follows.EndlessIterable iterable = new EndlessIterable(5000);try {    for(String s : iterable) { System.out.println(s); }} catch(Exception) {    System.out.println(\"exception detected: \" + e.getMessage());}System.out.println(\"done\");What I noticed is that the RuntimeException is thrown after the time is up, however, the for loop keeps going,the catch block is never reached, andi never reach the end of the code (printing done).Any strategy, approach or design pattern to resolve this problem I've described? Please notein my actual code, i have no control over Iteratori only have control over the Iterable and actual iteration\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
