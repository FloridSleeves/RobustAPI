We also define two choices (choice1 and choice2) and initialize counters for each choice. We then create an iterator using the Iterator.next method on a list containing the two choices. \n\nWe use nested for loops to iterate through each index in the array. If the count for choice1 is less than half of the total number of elements in the array, we assign choice1 to the current index and increment the count for choice1. Otherwise, we assign choice2 to the current index and increment the count for choice2.\n\nBy doing this, we ensure that once the array is filled, there will be an even split among the two choices."

Let's also assume for clarity that you can only choose between two things to put as a given item in the array. How would you go about putting a random choice at a given index in the array but once the array is filled you have an even split among the two choices?If there are any answers with code, Java is preferred but other languages are fine as well.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
