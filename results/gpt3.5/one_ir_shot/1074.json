A token is a sequence of characters that are considered to be a single unit. In this case, the email address and the number are considered as separate tokens. By calling nextToken() twice, you can retrieve the email address and the number separately."

I dont care about the command token.My code looks like this:String test2 = command.substring(7);StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(test2);String email = st.nextToken();String amount = st.nextToken();\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
