The iterator() method returns an Iterator over the elements in the list. The hasNext() method checks if there are more elements in the iterator and the next() method returns the next element in the iterator. By using a count variable, you can limit the loop to only iterate over half of the tiles."

I'm using them to make every class of my objects to do \"drawing\", but it takes a lot of memory so I want to cut it in half, is there a way to do for each loop not for a full list?for(Tile tile: tiles){tile.draw();}I want to:for(Tile tile: (half of)tiles){    tile.draw();}is it possible or I just need to get lenght of tiles and when it reaches the number break the loop?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
