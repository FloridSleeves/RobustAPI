Then, you can use the hasNext() method of the Iterator class to check if there are more elements in the list, and the next() method to retrieve the next element. In the code provided, the while loop will continue as long as there are more elements in the list and the iter2 counter is less than 50. Inside the loop, you can perform the desired operations on each element."
