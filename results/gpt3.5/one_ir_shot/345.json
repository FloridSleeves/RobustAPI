It checks if each date falls within the given date range (Feb1 thru June19) and if so, it retrieves the next date and creates an Interval object using the current and next dates. It then retrieves the corresponding object from the map using the current date as the key and adds the interval-object pair to the result TreeMap. Finally, it returns the sorted TreeMap of adjacent intervals."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Compare a dateRange with other continous dates in another list to get adjacent ranges relative to the list compared: :e.g.There is a date range from Feb9 thru May 19 in an interval. There is another list of effective dates in a Map for key values like  as of this date this object is returned (Jan 1, Object x), (Feb 1, Object y), (March 1, Object z) (April 1, Object a) (May 1, Object u), (June1, Object n) etc.The algorithm need is to take the date range of Feb1 thru June19 and to get adjacent dates for the effective date ranges e.g.the method would be TreeMapreturnTemporalAdjacentInterval(Interval when)result should be Treemap sorted by adjacent interval with (Feb9-March1, Object y) (March1-April1, Object z) (April1-May1, Object a) (May1-May19, Object u)This is like martin fowlers temporal collection however more of a temporal adjacent interval retrieval. Language is Java joda-time Interval is suggested use for the returned intervals.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
