In the provided code, I have modified the class X to implement the Iterator interface. The next() method is used to return the next element in the iteration. The hasNext() method is used to check if there are more elements to iterate over."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Iterating through elements of a data structure instead of Collection: :My problem is this: I have an iterator class which is supposed to iterate through elements in a given data structure, <E> let's say, but what I have managed to accomplish is that when I pass in the data structure it will iterate the data structure itself.ie. DynamicIterator it = new DynamicIterator(da);say da is an array the output will be [1,2,3,4,5,6] instead of 1,2,3,4,5,6My issue is, more than anything, understanding the generally accepted practice for dealing with this more than the issue itself.edit for code:public class X<E>{    private final E[] rray;    private int currentIndex = 0;    public X(E... a)     {        //if the incoming array is null, don't start        if(a == null)        {            System.out.println(\"Array is null\");            System.exit(1);        }        //set the temp array (rray) to the incoming array (a)        this.rray = a;    }    //hasNext element?    public boolean hasNext()    {        return rray.length > currentIndex;    }    //next element (depends on hasNext())    public E next()    {        if (!hasNext())        {            System.out.println(\"Element doesn't exist, done\");            System.exit(1);        }        return rray[currentIndex++];    }    //return array    public E[] access()    {        return rray;    }}\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
