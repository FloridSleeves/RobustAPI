Now, I need to split each of them using String.split(). I have a method that would correctly do the split operation, but I need to create a method that will store each element of my array in a string to pass it through to that method. The fact that each element of the array is being stored from an external txt file makes it even trickier. Any suggestions as to how to do this? Here is all of my code://store each line into an arrayimport java.io.*;import java.util.*;public class InfixToPostfix {private ObjectStack operator;public InfixToPostfix() {    operator = new ObjectStack();}   /** * method takes each expression from infix.txt and stores them in a string array * @param none * @return none */public String getInfix() {//declare new filestream    FileInputStream in = null;try {    in = new FileInputStream(\"infix.txt\");} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {    // TODO Auto-generated catch block    e.printStackTrace();}//declare a readerBufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(in));//declare string array to store elements inString[] list = new String[10];try {    do {        for (int i = 0; i < list.length; i++){            try {                list[i] = br.readLine();            } catch (IOException e) {                // TODO Auto-generated catch block                e.printStackTrace();            }        }    }    while (br.readLine() != null);}catch (IOException e1) {    // TODO Auto-generated catch block    e1.printStackTrace();}try {    in.close();} catch (IOException e) {    // TODO Auto-generated catch block    e.printStackTrace();}return (Arrays.toString(list));}//and the method that would perform the splitpublic static void parseArray(String entries) {    String delims = \"[ ]+\";    String[] tokens = entries.split(delims);}here is the txt file: 8 + 4 * 2 - 67 * 2 - 4 * 3 + 2 * 52 * 3 * 4 - 8 + 9 / 3 / 35 + 7 * 4 - 64 * ( 3 + 2 * 4 ) - 7( 5 + 7 ) / ( 9 - 5 )3 * ( 5 * ( 5 - 2 ) ) - 9( ( 5 * ( 4 + 2 ) - ( 8 + 8 ) / 2 ) - 9 ) ^ 3( ( 5 + 5 * ( 6 - 2 ) + 4 ^ 2 ) * 8 )( ( ( 3 ^ 4 ) ) )\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
