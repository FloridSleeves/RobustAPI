It returns -1 if the end of the stream is reached. In this code, we create a FileInputStream for the firmware image file and a GZIPInputStream to read the GZIP section. We then read the GZIP section byte by byte into a buffer and keep track of the number of bytes read, which gives us the compressed size of the GZIP section."

I am able to know the location of the start of the GZIP section using magic number and the GZIPInputStream in Java. However, I need to know the compressed size of the gzip section. GZIPInputStream would return me the uncompressed file size.Is there anybody who has an idea? \nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
