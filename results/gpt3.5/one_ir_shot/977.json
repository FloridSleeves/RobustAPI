The size of the byte array represents the size of the string in memory. In Java, strings are stored as UTF-16 encoded characters, which require more memory compared to the original file size. This is why the resulting string object in memory is larger than the file size. In C++, the string object is stored as a sequence of characters, which typically requires less memory compared to UTF-16 encoding."

This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: File size vs. in memory size in Java: :If I take an XML file that is around 2kB on disk and load the contents as a String into memory in Java and then measure the object size it's around 33kB.Why the huge increase in size?If I do the same thing in C++ the resulting string object in memory is much closer to the 2kB.To measure the memory in Java I'm using Instrumentation.For C++, I take the length of the serialized object (e.g string).\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:"
