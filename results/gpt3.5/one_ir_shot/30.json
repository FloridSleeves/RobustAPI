To generate a random number between min and max, you can multiply the random number by the range (max - min + 1) and add the minimum value. In this case, we are excluding three specific numbers by using a while loop to generate a new random number if it matches any of the excluded numbers."

I was able to do the random number using the math.rand() but I am trying to make sure that the three numbers do not match. I did a work around using while and if statements, but I was looking to see if there is a one line of command to do this, so that I can put it right under th activity class so that it's public var. and in that area (activity) I can't use while and if statements, I only can in onCreate due to the void or something. Thank you in advance for your help, and will vote for any help or idea that will lead to finding any info about this. \nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer:"
