It returns an int value representing the byte read, or -1 if the end of the stream is reached. In this case, you can use an InputStream to read the version byte from the log file. The version can be stored as an int value."

Im familiar with basic TCP sockets but want to know how to translate requirements into code.Example: Format for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Common Log Format (CLF)Would like to see how to translate: 0          7 8        15 16       23 24         31  +-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+  |  Version  |           Record Length           | 0 - 3  +-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+   Version (1 byte):  0x41 for this document; hexadecimal encoded.   Record Length (6 bytes):  Hexadecimal encoded total length of this  log record, including \"Flags\" and \"Record Length\" fields, and  terminating line-feed.into code.How can I define Version?Which type?Int, char, etc?Thanks\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
