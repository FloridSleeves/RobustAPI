It starts by getting the first list from the map using the iterator, and then iterates through each number in the first list. For each number, it checks if it appears in all other lists by iterating through the remaining lists and using the ArrayList.contains() method. If the number appears in all lists, it is added to the master list."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Find all numbers that appear in each of a set of lists: :I have several ArrayLists of Integer objects, stored in a HashMap.I want to get a list (ArrayList) of all the numbers (Integer objects) that appear in each list.My thinking so far is:Iterate through each ArrayList and put all the values into a HashSet This will give us a \"listing\" of all the values in the lists, but only onceIterate through the HashSet 2.1 With each iteration perform ArrayList.contains()  2.2 If none of the ArrayLists return false for the operation add the number to a \"master list\" which contains all the final values.If you can come up with something faster or more efficient, funny thing is as I wrote this I came up with a reasonably good solution. But I'll still post it just in case it is useful for someone else.But of course if you have a better way please do let me know.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
