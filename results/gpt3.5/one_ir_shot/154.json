Each client connection can be handled in a separate thread. Here is an example code snippet:\n\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.io.InputStream;\nimport java.net.ServerSocket;\nimport java.net.Socket;\n\npublic class MultiThreadedServer {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        try {\n            ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(8080);\n            while (true) {\n                Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();\n                Thread clientThread = new Thread(new ClientHandler(clientSocket));\n                clientThread.start();\n            }\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nclass ClientHandler implements Runnable {\n    private Socket clientSocket;\n\n    public ClientHandler(Socket clientSocket) {\n        this.clientSocket = clientSocket;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void run() {\n        try {\n            InputStream inputStream = clientSocket.getInputStream();\n            byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\n            int bytesRead;\n            while ((bytesRead = inputStream.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n                String message = new String(buffer, 0, bytesRead);\n                // Process the message and store it in the table\n                // Send acknowledgement to the client\n            }\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: In this approach, the server listens for incoming client connections using a ServerSocket. For each client connection, a new thread is created to handle the client's input. The InputStream.read method is used to read the messages sent by the clients. The messages can then be processed and stored in the table, and an acknowledgement can be sent back to the client. This allows the server to handle multiple clients simultaneously."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Socket Server with multiple client in java: :I have to create a socket server which will listen to multiple client. Suppose there are 6 clients connected to the server at the same time and each of the clients are sending some commands to server at the same time. If these clients sending the message to server for every 1 second how can I handle the those messages from the 6 clients on the server side to store it in the table and the acknowledgement to each client. How can i handle these input from from the client. Whether I have to create 6 threads to handle these inputs from the client. Please give me a idea to approach this issue.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
