Additionally, you can create a custom getter method for the activities list that uses an iterator to fetch only the 5 latest activities. The iterator's next() method is used to retrieve the next activity in the list, and a count variable is used to keep track of the number of activities fetched. The while loop continues until there are no more activities or the count reaches 5. The fetched activities are added to a new list, which is then returned."

Is it possible to automatically do it during any fetch from DB? (so that I don't have to limit the collection by hand in Java).@Entitypublic class Person {    @Id    @GeneratedValue    private Long id;    @OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL, fetch = FetchType.EAGER)    @OrderBy(\"timestamp DESC\")    @JoinColumn(name = \"PERSON_ID\")    private List<Activity> activities;    // other setters, getters, etc. }Essentially I'd like to keep, say, 20 entries in the ACTIVITY entries (dropping the oldest rows, when newer are inserted), but fetch only 5 latest. Is this possible?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
