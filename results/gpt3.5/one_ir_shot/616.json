This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Invoking method with a parameter of the value of a different variable type: :I have a bunch of variables declared as 2D arrays:int[][] array1 = {{}};int[][] array2 = {{}};etc..I'm currently using a method to invoke another method with one of the variables as a parameter with a switch:public void invokeMethod(){switch(variableNumber){    case 1: method(piece1);    break;    case 2: method(piece2);    break;    etc..  }}This feels like a phenomenally stupid way of approaching this issue, is there a more clever solution? Perhaps storing the variables in an array? What I'd like to do, in case I'm faced with thousands of 2D arrays, is invoking the method with the value of a variable of a different data type, like this:String arrayToBeInvokedWith = \"array1\";method(arrayToBeInvokedWith){}(Yes, I do know this is too simplistic, but you can get the idea from it)Is there a similar solution? Any feedback is much appreciated.EDIT: All of the arrays have a same size.\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:"
