By moving the creation of the StringTokenizer inside the loop, it will tokenize each line separately. Additionally, you need to check if there are more tokens available using the hasMoreTokens() method before calling nextToken()."

But every time I run the code I get no such element exception, i don't understand why?try {        FileReader fr = new FileReader(file);        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);        String line = br.readLine();        String id = new String();        StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(line, \",\");        while(line != null){            while(!id.equals(args[0])){                line = br.readLine();                id = st.nextToken();            }        }    } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {        System.out.println(\"file not found\");    } catch (IOException e) {        System.out.println(\"not a string\");    }The file looks something like this:line1: 118, s, m, pline2: 111, s, m, c\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
