The PrintWriter.append() method appends the specified content after the existing content in the file, while the PrintWriter.write() method writes the specified content at the current position in the file. \n\nIn your current implementation, you are using PrintWriter.append() to add the line \"String\\r\\n\" before calling the inner object's writer method. However, since the inner object's writer method also uses PrintWriter.append(), it appends its content after the existing content in the file, including the line \"String\\r\\n\" that was added before.\n\nTo resolve this issue and ensure that the line \"String\\r\\n\" is added before the inner object's content, you can replace the calls to PrintWriter.append() with PrintWriter.write(). This will write the content at the current position in the file, ensuring that the line \"String\\r\\n\" is added before the inner object's content.\n\nI have provided the modified code above, where PrintWriter.write() is used instead of PrintWriter.append() in both the outer object's writer method and the inner object's writer method. This should result in the desired order of content in the file."

When I'm trying to print the list to a file, I go through each object and call the object's respective writer methods.public void writer(String file, boolean append) {    File path = new File(\"../Opdracht6_2/src/\" + file);    try {        PrintWriter write = new PrintWriter(new FileOutputStream(path,                append));        for (SuperObject o : this.list) {            if (o instanceof Object1) {                ((subObject1) w).writer1(file);            }            if (o instanceof Object2) {                ((subObject3) w).writer2(file);                            }if (o instanceof Object3) {                ((subObject3) w).writer3(file);                            }        }        write.close();    } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {        // TODO Auto-generated catch block        e.printStackTrace();    }}In the object's writer method I try to first print a line which says what type it is and then call the writer method for the innerobject. After that I want current object's arguments to be printed and than it goes back to the lists writer methodpublic void writer1(String file) {    File path = new File(\"../Opdracht6_2/src/\" + file);    try {        PrintWriter write = new PrintWriter(                new FileOutputStream(path, true));        //below is the string I want to print before the innerobject appends         //its own arguments to the file        write.append(\"String\\r\\n\");        this.innerobject.innerwriter();        write.append(this objects arg);        write.close();    } catch (IOException e) {        // TODO Auto-generated catch block        e.printStackTrace();    }}The innerobject's writerpublic void innerwriter(String file) {    File path = new File(\"../Opdracht6_2/src/\" + file);    try {        PrintWriter write = new PrintWriter(                new FileOutputStream(path, true));        write.append(this objects arg);        write.close();    } catch (IOException e) {        // TODO Auto-generated catch block        e.printStackTrace();    }}Now the thing that is actually happening is that the line that I'm trying to append first gets appended after the innerobject's arguments even though I have put it before the method that calls the innerobject's writer.It looks like this then in the file:inner objects argstringouter objects argCan someone explain why?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
