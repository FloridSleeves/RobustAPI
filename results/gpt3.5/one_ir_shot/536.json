The iterator's hasNext() method checks if there is a next element in the Map. If there is no next element, you can reset the iterator by assigning it to the iterator of the Map again. Then, you can use the iterator's next() method to get the next player in the Map and set it as the currentPlayerTurn. This will allow you to continuously loop/iterate around the Map."

This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Need a way of continuously looping/iterating around a Map: :I am building a game in java and I have a 'Map' of Player objects. I have a method called endOfTurn which is called when the player wants to finish their turn, It sets the 'currentPlayerTurn' field to the next player in the Map. However once I reach the end of my map i want it to go back to the first player in the map and go round again and again. Is there a way of doing this? Also yes the players data structure does need to be a map!public class Game {private Map<String,Player> players;private Player currentPlayerTurn;public boolean EndOfTurn(Player currentPlayerTurn) {    //need to set this.currentPlayerTurn to the next player in the Map}I have looked into using an iterator but this doesnt seem to have a reset function or a 'loop around' mode. Any ideas?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
