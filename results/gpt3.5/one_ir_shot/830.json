By creating a new instance of PrintWriter with the file name, you can write to the file using the write() method. To empty the current content, you can write an empty string (\"\") to the file. After each write operation, you need to flush the writer to ensure that the data is written to the file immediately. Finally, close the writer to release any system resources associated with it. This approach avoids opening the file multiple times."
