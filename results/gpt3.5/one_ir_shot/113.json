In order to write integers to the file, you should use the writeInt() method instead. Additionally, you should close the DataOutputStream after writing the data to ensure that the changes are saved to the file."

When I execute the code I get a \"No file exist\" as the output and no data.txt file is created in the dir.What am I missing?  The odd thing is that it was working fine the other night, but when I loaded it up today to test it out again, this happened.  Here is the code:import java.io.*;import java.util.*;public class DataStreams {    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {        try {            DataOutputStream out = new DataOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(\"C:\\\\data.txt\"));            for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {                out.write(i);            }        } catch (IOException ioe) {            System.out.println(\"No file exist\");        }    }}The data file should be a simple display of numbers 1 through 9.  Thanks for your input.\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:"
