This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Concurrent calls to API to return different object: :I have the following scenario Query results:student1  subject1  marks1student2  subject1  marks3......The API code looks like thisStudentObj getStudentInfo() {    List<StudentObj> stObj = StudentDAO.getRows(); //    for (StudentObj s : stObj) {       //What should I write here??    }}I want to be able to return student1 rows, student2 rows separately in concurrent calls to my API. I am using Hibernate (to which I am relatively new) on top of oracle database.I was thinking in lines of locking student1 row and returning that row, but I am not very conversant with locking in hibernate.On Client Side time t1: getStudentInfo() (work on student1) |  getStudentInfo() //Call concurrently (work on student2)time t1+10sec: getStudentInfo (work on student3)time t1+20sec: getStudentInfo (work on student4)First call should be able to work on student1 and second concurrent call should be able to work on student2.Edit: Made changes based on comments. ( I cannot edit the query and clients getStudentInfo cannot pass the id if that helps).\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
