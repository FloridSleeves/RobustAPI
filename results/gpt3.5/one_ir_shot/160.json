It returns the byte as an integer in the range 0 to 255. If no byte is available because the end of the stream has been reached, the value -1 is returned. This is a blocking method, meaning it will wait until data is available to be read.\nRegarding your question about EasyMock and partial mocking, it is generally considered a bad practice. Partial mocking can make the code more complex and harder to maintain. It is often a sign of a design flaw, as you mentioned, where a class has multiple concerns. It is recommended to refactor the class and separate the concerns into separate classes. This will make the code more modular and easier to test. If you find that you need to mock only a few methods of an object, you can consider using a mocking framework like Mockito, which allows you to mock specific methods without needing to partially mock the entire object."

This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Easymock partially mocking (EasyMock ClassExtension), good or bad?: :I have written quite a few Mock objects using EasyMock. However, often i find writing partial mocks time consuming, and it does not feel 'right'.I'd say its a design fault as my class I try to mock has multiple concerns into one, therefore I should create seperate classes in order to seperate concerns.What do you think? Is partially mocking a good or bad thing? And, if good/bad, why? What would you suggest if you notice you cannot mock the object because you only want to mock a few methods?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
