The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Java: common interface to InputStream and OutputStream: :This question is related (in some way) with this one.Basically, I want to make a function, like this:public InputOutputStream func(){    if (condition)    {        // open a file stream and convert to InputOutputStream     }    else    {        // make an InputOutputStream from string    }}Several questions arise:I can't find anywhere class like InputOutputStream. It's only InputStream and OutputStream and its variations (like InputDataStream, OutputDataStream, etc). Is there one? I need a stream which supports both read and write operations.How can I make an InputOutputStream from file?How can I make an InputOutputStream from string?For C++ InputOutputStream is a std::iostream. And I can convert std::fstream or std::stringstream to it without any problems. Is it reachable in Java?Thanks.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
