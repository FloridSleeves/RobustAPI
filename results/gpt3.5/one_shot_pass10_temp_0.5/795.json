If the file doesn't exists, I want to create the file and then add the data.Adding data works fine. But appending data overwrites existing data.

String savestr = \"mysave.sav\";     File f = new File(savestr);    PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(savestr);    if ( f.exists() && !f.isDirectory() ) {        out = new PrintWriter(new FileOutputStream(new File(savestr), true));        out.append(mapstring);        out.close();    }    else {        out.println(mapstring);        out.close();    }where mapstring is the string I want to append.
