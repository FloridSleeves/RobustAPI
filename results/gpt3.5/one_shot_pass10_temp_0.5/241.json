The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Println the return values of an executable: :I have deploy an matlab .m file into an windows console application. The matlab file that I deploy is in fact a matlab function which have no arguments and return a list of integer. I am running that .exe from java code using process to run my executable file. I am tried to read the return values using the following code:            Process process = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(\"epidemic.exe\");            //process.waitFor();            System.out.println(\"....\");            InputStream in = process.getInputStream();  // To read process standard output            InputStream err = process.getErrorStream(); // To read process error output            while (process.isAlive()) {                while (in.available() > 0 || err.available() > 0) {                    if (in.available() > 0) {                        System.out.print((char)in.read()); // You might wanna echo it to your console to see progress                    }                    if (err.available() > 0) {                        err.read(); // You might wanna echo it to your console to see progress                    }                }                Thread.sleep(1);            }           System.out.println(\"....\");EDIT: Based on the proposed changes I re-change my code. Again, it doesn't seem print the returned values. If this code is ok, how could I check if the executable indeed return values? \nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
