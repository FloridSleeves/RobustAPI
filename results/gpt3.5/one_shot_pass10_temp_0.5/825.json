By default, PrintWriter uses a buffer size of 8192 characters. If the data you are trying to write exceeds this buffer size, it may not be written entirely. To fix this, you can wrap the PrintWriter with a BufferedWriter and specify a larger buffer size. This ensures that all the data is written to the file. Additionally, make sure to flush and close the PrintWriter after writing to ensure that all the data is written and the resources are properly released."
