I have no idea what I am doing wrong. Right now I have nested for loops comparing an int to the rest in the ArrayList. except how I either setup or increment I am skipping the duplicate next to where I start the first for loop over again. I have found it useful to reset my i=0 after I remove my index j. It still won't remove the duplicate if they are right next to each other.for(int i=0;i<original.size();i++){    for(int j=i+1;j<original.size();j++){        if(original.get(i)==original.get(j)){            original.remove(j);           }    }}EDIT: I found my solution, when I changed my second for loop to a while loop, then incremented each time, but when I found a duplicate I removed 1 from j. That way I would be starting over.Thank you all. \nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
