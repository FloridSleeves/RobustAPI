To overcome this, you can use the Pattern.quote() method to escape any special characters in the pattern. In your case, you can modify your code as shown above to use Pattern.quote(\"\u00a7\") as the argument for split() method.

The issue is with the regular expression used as the delimiter in the split() method. The split() method in Java takes a regular expression as the delimiter, and the character \"|\" has a special meaning in regular expressions. It is used to specify alternation, which means it matches either the expression before or after it.\n\nTo fix this issue, you need to escape the \"|\" character in the regular expression by using \"\\\\\". Here's the updated code:\n\nString input = \"Look like this\u00a70\u00a725\";\nString[] data = input.split(\"\\\\\u00a7\");\n\nThis will correctly split the input string into a 3-long String array with the values \"Look like this\", \"0\", and \"25\"."

The issue you are facing might be caused by the encoding of the \u00a7 character in Android. Make sure that the \u00a7 character in your input string is the same as the one you are using in your split() method. You can also try using the unicode representation of \u00a7 (\\u00A7) in your split() method to ensure consistency across platforms."

In regular expressions, the character \"|\" has a special meaning, so it needs to be escaped with a backslash (\"\\\") in order to be treated as a literal character. \n\nIn your case, you can use the Pattern.quote() method to automatically escape any special characters in the input string.

In your code, you are splitting the input string using the \"\u00a7\" delimiter. However, the \"\u00a7\" character is not a regular expression metacharacter, so you don't need to use Pattern.quote().\n\nThe reason you are getting a 1-long String[] with the value \"Look like this\u00a70\u00a725\" in Android is because the \"\u00a7\" character is not found in the input string. Therefore, the split() method does not split the string and returns the original string as the only element in the array.\n\nTo fix this issue, you can try using the following code:\n\nString input = \"Look like this\u00a70\u00a725\";\nString[] data = input.split(\"\u00a7\", -1);\n\nThe additional parameter \"-1\" in the split() method ensures that trailing empty strings are included in the resulting array.\n\nAfter making this change, the data array should be a 3-long String[] with the values \"Look like this\", \"0\", and \"25\"."
