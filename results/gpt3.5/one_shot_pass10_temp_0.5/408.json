In the condition `((String)it.next()).length() == len`, you are calling `it.next()` to check the length of the string. Then, in `System.out.println( it.next() )`, you are calling `it.next()` again to print the next element. This causes the iterator to skip every other element and print only the elements at odd positions. To fix this, you can store the value of `it.next()` in a variable and use that variable in both the condition and the print statement."

Each time you call `it.next()`, it moves the iterator to the next element. So, in your code, when the length condition is true, you call `it.next()` to print the element, but then you call `it.next()` again to check the length condition, which moves the iterator to the next element. This is why you are getting the wrong output. To fix this, you should store the element in a variable and use that variable to check the length condition and print the element."
