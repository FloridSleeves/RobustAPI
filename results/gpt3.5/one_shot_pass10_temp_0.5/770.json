This way, you don't need to worry about the location of the image file within the JAR file. You can use a tool like Base64Encoder to encode the image file into base64 and then include the encoded data in the \"src\" attribute of the \"img\" tag."

Create a folder named \"webapp\" in your Maven project's src/main/resources directory.\n2. Place all your images, CSS files, and JavaScript files inside the \"webapp\" folder.\n3. In your pom.xml file, add the following configuration for the Maven Jetty Plugin:\n\n<build>\n    <plugins>\n        <plugin>\n            <groupId>org.eclipse.jetty</groupId>\n            <artifactId>jetty-maven-plugin</artifactId>\n            <version>9.4.19.v20190610</version>\n            <configuration>\n                <webAppSourceDirectory>src/main/resources/webapp</webAppSourceDirectory>\n            </configuration>\n        </plugin>\n    </plugins>\n</build>\n\n4. Run your Maven project using the command \"mvn jetty:run\".\n5. Access your servlet's output in the browser using the URL \"http://localhost:8080/hello\".\n6. The images, CSS files, and JavaScript files should now be displayed correctly in the servlet's output.\n\nNote: Make sure to update the image source in your servlet's HTML code to match the correct path. For example, if your image is located at \"src/main/resources/webapp/img/img.jpg\", the image source should be \"<img src=\"/img/img.jpg\">\".\n\n<<<explanation>>>: By configuring the Maven Jetty Plugin to use the \"webapp\" folder as the web application source directory, Jetty will be able to serve the images, CSS files, and JavaScript files directly from the classpath."

Just make sure to update the resource path accordingly.\n\nNote that you may need to set the appropriate content type for the response, depending on the type of resource you are serving. For example, for images, you can set the content type to \"image/jpeg\" using the following code:\n\nresponse.setContentType(\"image/jpeg\");\n\nThis will ensure that the browser interprets the response as an image.\n\nI hope this helps!

PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();    response.setContentType( \"text/html\");    out.println( \"<html><head><title>Hellow World</title></head>\");    out.println( \"<body><h1>Hello World</h1>\" );       out.println( \"<img src=\\\"/img/img.jpg\\\">\" );    out.println( \"</body></html>\");    out.close();The image file (img.jpg) is after the build, located in a subfolder \"img\" in the root of the jar file ...I would like to use many more images, css files and javascripts. All of them will be embeded in the Jar file.Does anyone have any experience in displaying images in the ouput of a servlet, and where the images are located within the jar file ?Thanks\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
