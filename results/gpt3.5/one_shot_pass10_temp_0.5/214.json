The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Reading all string from a server socket which has not been closed: :I have a problem with socket programming in Java. There is a server which has been written in python like this which I shouldn't not change.s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)s.connect((TCP_IP, TCP_PORT))s.send('from server\\nnewline\\0')data = s.recv(BUFFER_SIZE)s.close()Now I want to write a code in Java which read the string from a server. Something like this:public static String readStr(Socket client) throws IOException {        InputStreamReader inStream = new InputStreamReader(                client.getInputStream());        BufferedReader inBuff = new BufferedReader(inStream);        String answer = new String();        String str = inBuff.readLine();        while (str!=null) {            answer = answer.concat(str + \"\\n\");            str = inBuff.readLine();        }        answer = answer.substring(0, answer.length() - 1);        System.out.println(\"answer:\\n \"+answer);        return answer;    }But it seems that it blocks at line str = inBuff.readLine(); at the last line of the message. I tried the read() method but it was blocked too.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
