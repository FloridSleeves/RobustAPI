The purpose of a Set is to store a collection of unique elements, without any concern for their order. Therefore, it does not make sense to retrieve an element from a Set based on its index, as the index is not meaningful in a Set.\n\nIf you need to retrieve elements from a Set in a specific order, you can convert the Set to a List using the ArrayList constructor, which takes a Collection as input. Then, you can use the get(int index) method of the List to retrieve elements at specific indices.\n\nHere's an example:\n\nSet<String> set = new HashSet<>();\nset.add(\"Apple\");\nset.add(\"Banana\");\nset.add(\"Orange\");\n\nList<String> list = new ArrayList<>(set);\nString element = list.get(0); // Retrieves the first element in the list\n\nAlternatively, if you want to retrieve a specific element from a Set without converting it to a List, you can use an Iterator or a for-each loop to iterate over the Set and find the desired element. For example:\n\nSet<String> set = new HashSet<>();\nset.add(\"Apple\");\nset.add(\"Banana\");\nset.add(\"Orange\");\n\nString desiredElement = \"Banana\";\n\nfor (String element : set) {\n  if (element.equals(desiredElement)) {\n    // Found the desired element\n    break;\n  }\n}\n\nIn summary, Sets are designed for storing unique elements without any specific order, so they do not provide a get(int index) method. If you need to retrieve elements in a specific order or access them by index, you can convert the Set to a List or use an Iterator/for-each loop to find the desired element."

(other than using an iterator)I'm sure the fact that it's excluded from the API means there's a good reason for not doing this -- could someone please enlighten me?EDIT:Some extremely great answers here, and a few saying \"more context\".  The specific scenario was a dbUnit test, where I could reasonably assert that the returned set from a query had only 1 item, and I was trying to access that item.However, the question is more valid without the scenario, as it remains more focussed:What's the difference between set and list.Thanks to all for the fantastic answers below.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
