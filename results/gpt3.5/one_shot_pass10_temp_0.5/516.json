In the dialog that appears, select the interface you want to implement (e.g., Iterator<Integer>) and click \"OK\".\n3. Eclipse will generate stubs for all the methods in the interface.\n4. To delegate the implementation to another object, you can create a field of the interface type in your class and assign an instance of a class that implements the interface to it.\n5. In the generated stubs, you can call the corresponding methods on the delegate object.\n\nHere's an example:\n```\npublic class Foo implements Iterator<Integer> {\n    private Iterator<Integer> delegate;\n\n    public Foo() {\n        // Assign an instance of a class that implements Iterator<Integer> to the delegate field\n        delegate = new MyIterator();\n    }\n\n    // Generated stubs\n    @Override\n    public boolean hasNext() {\n        return delegate.hasNext();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public Integer next() {\n        return delegate.next();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void remove() {\n        delegate.remove();\n    }\n\n    // Other methods of Foo\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `Foo` implements the `Iterator<Integer>` interface by delegating the implementation to the `MyIterator` class. You can replace `MyIterator` with any other class that implements `Iterator<Integer>`."
