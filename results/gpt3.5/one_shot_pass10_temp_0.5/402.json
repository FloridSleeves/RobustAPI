This exception occurs when you modify a collection while iterating over it using an iterator.

Even though you're using a synchronized list, it only provides thread-safety for individual operations, not for the entire iteration process.\n\nTo fix this issue, you can use a concurrent collection like ConcurrentLinkedQueue instead of ArrayList.
