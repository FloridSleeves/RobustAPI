Each time a message is to be sent a new RabbitMQ connection is built.  This seems a bit wasteful.  I am just wondering if this is really necessary or if there is a reason why the connection cannot be held in a Singleton and only built once (for multiple sends).  This is the sending method:private void send(String routingKey, String message) throws Exception {     String exchange = applicationConfiguration.getAMQPExchange();      String ipAddress = applicationConfiguration.getAMQPHost();    String exchangeType = applicationConfiguration.getAMQPExchangeType();    String password = applicationConfiguration.getAMQPUser();    String user = applicationConfiguration.getAMQPPassword();    String virtualHost = applicationConfiguration.getAMQPVirtualHost();    String port = applicationConfiguration.getAMQPPort();    ConnectionFactory factory = new ConnectionFactory();    factory.setUsername(user);    factory.setPassword(password);    factory.setVirtualHost(virtualHost);    factory.setPort(Integer.parseInt(port));    factory.setHost(ipAddress);    Connection connection = factory.newConnection();    Channel channel = connection.createChannel();    channel.exchangeDeclare(exchange, exchangeType);    channel.basicPublish(exchange, routingKey, null, message.getBytes());    log.debug(\" [AMQP] Sent message with key {} : {}\",routingKey, message);    connection.close();}or a possible singleton:public class MyConnection {    private static MyConnection singleton = new MyConnection();    private static Connection connection;    private MyConnection() {        ConnectionFactory factory = new ConnectionFactory();        String exchange = applicationConfiguration.getAMQPExchange();          String ipAddress = applicationConfiguration.getAMQPHost();        String exchangeType = applicationConfiguration.getAMQPExchangeType();        String password = applicationConfiguration.getAMQPUser();        String user = applicationConfiguration.getAMQPPassword();        String virtualHost = applicationConfiguration.getAMQPVirtualHost();        String port = applicationConfiguration.getAMQPPort();        try {            factory.setUsername(user);            factory.setPassword(password);            factory.setVirtualHost(virtualHost);            factory.setPort(Integer.parseInt(port));            factory.setHost(ipAddress);            connection = factory.newConnection();        }        catch (Exception e) {            e.printStackTrace();        }    }    public static Connection getInstance( ) {        return connection;    }}\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:"
