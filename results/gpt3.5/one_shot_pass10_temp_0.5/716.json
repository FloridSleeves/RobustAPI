When you create the PrintWriter with just the file name, it overwrites the existing file. To append to the file, you need to pass the FileWriter object to the PrintWriter constructor and set the second parameter of the FileWriter constructor to true. This will allow you to append to the file instead of overwriting it. Additionally, you should use the println method instead of print to ensure that each line is written on a new line."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1.

But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Appending .txt file is erasing everything: :import java.io.FileWriter;import java.io.PrintWriter;public class DemoPrint {    public static void main (String args []) {        try{            PrintWriter coolFile = new PrintWriter(\"c:\\\\JavaIO\\\\cool.txt\");            FileWriter file = new FileWriter(\"c:\\\\JavaIO\\\\cool.txt\", true);            coolFile.println(\"Why isn't this adding another line?\");            coolFile.close();        }        catch (Exception e) {            System.out.println(\"Error\");        }}    }So I'm new to programming/java and I'm trying to open this file and append the data and add another line but for some reason the data is just being erased and overwritten with whatever I have in the coolFile.println(\"\").Can anyone help me out on this? I know its probably a easy fix... I'm learning.. Thank you!\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
