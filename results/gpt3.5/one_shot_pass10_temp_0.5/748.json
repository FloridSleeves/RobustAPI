That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: error: unreported exception FileNotFoundException; must be caught or declared to be thrown: :This question already has an answer here:                                                            What does \"error: unreported exception <XXX>; must be caught or declared to be thrown\" mean and how do I fix it?                                (1 answer)                            Closed last year.I'm trying to create a simple program that will output a string to a text file. Using code I found here, I have put together the following code: import java.io.*;public class Testing {  public static void main(String[] args) {    File file = new File (\"file.txt\");    file.getParentFile().mkdirs();    PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(file);    printWriter.println (\"hello\");    printWriter.close();         }} J-grasp throws me the following error:  ----jGRASP exec: javac -g Testing.javaTesting.java:10: error: unreported exception FileNotFoundException; must be caught or declared to be thrown    PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(file);                              ^1 error ----jGRASP wedge2: exit code for process is 1.Since I'm pretty new to Java, I have no idea what this means. Can anybody point me in the right direction? \nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
