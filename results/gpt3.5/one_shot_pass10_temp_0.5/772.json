That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Changes printed to a file aren't being saved: :try{ private fileWriter= new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(file.txt));                fileWriter.print(\"hello world\");                System.out.println(\"file written\");                fileWriter.close();}catch (IOException e){            e.printStackTrace();        } finally {        }I have this text file in my source folder. So far, there haven't been any errors with accessing it. However, when I close the program or after when the files should have been written when I open the text file I don't find them there, however I did check the bin folder ocne and it seemed to print hello world to the temp copy there. I want the changes it makes to be permanent.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
