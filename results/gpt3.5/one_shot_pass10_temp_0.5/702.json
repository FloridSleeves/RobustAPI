However, it is important to note that some programs, like Excel or Word, may update the file's last modified time even if no changes were made. This is because these programs may perform some internal operations when closing the file. To monitor file changes accurately, you can compare the last modified time with a previously stored value and only react if the new value is different. Additionally, if you need more accuracy, you can use other methods like file length or checksum to determine if the file content has actually changed."

This behavior is dependent on the file system and the specific program used to open the file.\n\nTo monitor file changes and react to them, you can store the initial last modified time of the file and periodically check if it has changed. If the last modified time is different from the stored value, it means the file has been modified.\n\nRegarding the issue with minute accuracy, the last modified time returned by File.lastModified() has millisecond accuracy, not minute accuracy. The dir shell script may be rounding the time to the nearest minute, which is why you are seeing minute accuracy in that case."

However, it is important to note that some programs, such as Excel or Word, may update the file's last modified timestamp even if no changes were made to the file. This can lead to false positives when monitoring file changes. To overcome this, you can compare the current last modified timestamp with the previous one and only react to changes if they differ. Additionally, if you need more accuracy than minute level, you may need to consider using a different approach, such as using a file system watcher library or monitoring file system events directly."

If you are experiencing issues with the lastModified() method returning a different value when the file is closed without any changes, it could be due to the behavior of the operating system or the specific program you are using to open the file. It is possible that the act of opening and closing the file by another program updates the file's metadata, including the modification time. If you require more accurate monitoring of file changes, you may need to explore other options such as using a file system watcher or a library specifically designed for file monitoring."

However, it may not accurately reflect the actual modification time if the file is open by another program or if the file system has certain limitations. In such cases, the last modified timestamp may change even if no changes were made to the file. To monitor file changes more accurately, you can consider using a file system monitoring library or API that provides more reliable and precise information about file modifications."
