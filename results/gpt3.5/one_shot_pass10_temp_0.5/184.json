It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: ByteArrayInputStream#read() strange behaviour for negative input bytes: :I faced with this code in test.byte[] bytes = new byte[] { -1, 1, 0x0 }; InputStream in = new ByteArrayInputStream(bytes); System.out.println(in.read() + in.read() + in.read());I expected that this code returns 0 (-1+1+0) but it returns 256.I am very wondered.Who can explain this bahaviour?P.S.Revealed that the first statement returns 255.
