The iterator() method returns a new iterator every time it is called. So when you call it again in the set.remove(obj) line, you're actually getting a new iterator that starts from the beginning of the set. As a result, the element you retrieved in the previous line is no longer the first element. To fix this, you can store the iterator in a variable and use it consistently throughout the method.
