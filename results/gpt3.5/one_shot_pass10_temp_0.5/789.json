To print the exception stack trace to the file, you can use the `printStackTrace(PrintWriter)` method of the Throwable class, passing in the PrintWriter object as the argument. Additionally, you need to close the PrintWriter after writing to the file to ensure that the data is flushed and the file is properly closed."
