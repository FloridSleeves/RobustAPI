The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Issue with a Process Object of Java: :I have a problem with a Process Object of Java.I want to open the process called linphonec.exe to make calls, and inside this process I have to insert a few command lines to do calls, answer ...The problem comes when I have to insert more than one command line because the OutputStream of Process only accepts a command line when I call the close() method of OutputStream. If I dont call this method the command line isn't executed.I want to execute more than one command but I can't.Example:\"Call phone\" and then \"terminate\" to end the call whenever I want. But I can only insert the first command line and if I dont use the close() method the command line is not executed.Code:Start a process:ProcessBuilder builder = new ProcessBuilder(PROCESS);builder.redirectErrorStream(true);Process p = builder.start();Read the InputStream of Process:InputStream i = p.getInputStream();System.out.print((char)i.read());while(i.available() > 0){    System.out.print((char)i.read());}Insert command line into OutputStream:String command = com.nextLine();OutputStream o = p.getOutputStream();o.write(comando.getBytes());o.flush();o.close();If I delete \"o.close()\" the command line is not executed, but if I execute it I can't execute the other command lines.I tried the code on my program, but when I insert the command line I dont see the next information of the process.When I put your code :ReadyWarning: video is disabled in linphonec, use -V or -C or -D to enable.linphonec> Registration on sip:XX.XX.XX.XX successful.linphonec> call XXXExemple with my code:ReadyWarning: video is disabled in linphonec, use -V or -C or -D to enable.linphonec> Registration on sip:XX.XX.XX.XX successful.linphonec> call XXXEstablishing call id to sip:XXX@XX.XX.XX.XX, assigned id 1With \"Available > 0\" I get \"Establishing call id to sip:XXX@XX.XX.XX.XX, assigned id 1\".If I use this loop I dont see the other info of the process.I think the problem is that the outputstream does not get the command lines until I execute the Close method.Thank you.Sorry for my bad englando.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
