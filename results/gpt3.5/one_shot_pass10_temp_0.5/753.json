That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Q re Java Programme to read from a text file, create an arraylist, reformat, and output to another file: :As a java student (beginner) I've just completed a task to write a program to perform the following tasks:Read the content of a text file;Pick out all words within the text, replacing all upper case letters with lower case ones;Produce a dictionary of the words appearing in the text (i.e., a list of the words in alphabetical order, one word per line, without duplication);Output the dictionary to another file.We were advised to have a single class containing our main method, and use the ArrayList, Scanner, PrintWriter and FileReader classes. I managed to do the below, which works, but it has raised some questions/fundamental gaps in my knowledge. I  believe that based on the principles of good O.O. programming practice, I should break the below down into a series of methods that have a single purpose, and then call those methods. However, I really struggle doing this. Can anyone please elaborate/advise a way to improve on that specific point? Or correct me if I'm wrong? public class Main{    private static ArrayList<String> dictionary;     private static ArrayList<String> tempdictionary;    public static void main() throws FileNotFoundException    {        Scanner inFile = new Scanner(new FileReader(\"H:\\\\csc8001\\\\results.txt\"));        dictionary = new ArrayList <>();        tempdictionary = new ArrayList <>();        while (inFile.hasNext()) {             dictionary.add(inFile.next().toLowerCase().replaceAll(\"[^a-zA-Z ]\", \"\"));        }        inFile.close();        PrintWriter outFile = new PrintWriter(\"H:\\\\csc8001\\\\results1.txt\");        int index = 0;        for (String a : dictionary)        {            if (!tempdictionary.contains(a)){                 tempdictionary.add(a);            } else {                index++;            }        }        Collections.sort(tempdictionary);        for (int i=0; i<tempdictionary.size(); i++)            outFile.println(tempdictionary.get(i));        outFile.flush();        outFile.close();    }}\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
