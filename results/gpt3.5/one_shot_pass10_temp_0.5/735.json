That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1.

But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Java printwriter only writes one line: :Closed. This question needs details or clarity.
