However, it seems that the BOM is not being correctly recognized by the CSV reader. One possible solution is to try writing the BOM as a byte sequence instead of a character. You can modify the code as follows:\n\ntry { \n    printWriter.write(new byte[]{(byte)0xEF, (byte)0xBB, (byte)0xBF});\n    printWriter.flush();\n} catch (Exception e) { \n    e.printStackTrace(); \n}\n\nThis code writes the UTF-8 BOM as a byte sequence (0xEF, 0xBB, 0xBF) to the output stream.
