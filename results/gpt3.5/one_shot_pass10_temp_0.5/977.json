This is because Java uses Unicode characters, which typically require more than one byte to represent each character.\n\nTo measure the memory size of the string object in Java, you can convert it to a byte array using the String.getBytes() method, specifying the appropriate character encoding (e.g., UTF-8). Then, you can use the InstrumentationAgent.getObjectSize() method to measure the size of the byte array in memory.\n\nIn C++, the resulting string object in memory may be closer to the size of the file on disk because C++ uses single-byte characters by default. However, the size may still differ depending on the specific implementation and encoding used.\n\nNote that measuring the memory size of an object in Java can be complex and may not always provide an accurate representation of the actual memory usage. It is recommended to use tools like profilers to get more precise measurements."
