That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Output text to a file with a class method java: :I have a valet class method that should write an hourly wage to a file:public void hourlyOverall() throws FileNotFoundException{    PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(\"wage info\");    new FileOutputStream(\"wage info\", true);    hourlyOverall = tips / hours + hourlyWage;    out.println(hourlyOverall);}However, when I run valet.hourlyOverall() in my main method, the file \"wage info\" is created but nothing is written to it.  What am I doing wrong?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
