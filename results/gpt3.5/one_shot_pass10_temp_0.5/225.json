The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: How to run a mvn command from a java program?: :I am building a Java program for automating a procedure in my server side. Normally I cd to Desktop/GIT/ and use this maven command \"mvn integration-test -DskipTests -P interactive -e\".I am building a java program and I am trying to run that command line but so far I wasn't successful. So far, here is the code:public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException {// TODO Auto-generated method stub Process theProcess = null;try  {      theProcess = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(\"mvn integration-test -DskipTests -P interactive -e\");  } catch(IOException e)  {     System.err.println(\"Error on exec() method\");     e.printStackTrace();    }// read from the called program's standard output stream  try  {     inStream = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader( theProcess.getInputStream()));       System.out.println(inStream.readLine());  }  catch(IOException e)  {     System.err.println(\"Error on inStream.readLine()\");     e.printStackTrace();    }break;    }}in.close();}\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
