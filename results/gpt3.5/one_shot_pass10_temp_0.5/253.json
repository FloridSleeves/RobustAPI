In this example, we initialize variables to keep track of the number of bits to read, the number of bits already read, the current byte being processed, and the current bit within the byte. We also initialize a buffer to store the byte read from the InputStream.\n\nInside the while loop, we check if we have read all the required bits by comparing the bytesRead variable with the bitsToRead variable. If we have read all the bits, we can break out of the loop. Otherwise, we check if we have reached the end of the current byte by checking if the currentBit variable is less than 0. If so, we read the next byte from the InputStream into the buffer. If the read operation returns -1, it means we have reached the end of the file, and we can handle it accordingly.\n\nTo get the next bit from the current byte, we shift the byte to the right by the currentBit position and perform a bitwise AND operation with 1. This extracts the bit at the current position. We then apply the crc algorithm to the bit by left-shifting the crc variable by 1 and performing an XOR operation with a specific value depending on the bit value (1 or 0).\n\nAfter processing the bit, we decrement the currentBit variable and increment the bytesRead variable. This allows us to move to the next bit in the next iteration of the loop.\n\nOnce we have finished reading the required number of bits, you can continue with the rest of your code."
