In Java, raw types can lead to type safety issues. To fix this, you should specify the types for your HashMap as follows:\n\nHashMap<Somekey, Object> data = new HashMap<Somekey, Object>();\ndata.put(somekey, \"asdfdsafdsf\");\nString value = (String) data.get(somekey);\n\nHowever, if you are sure that the value stored in the HashMap is always a String, you can use generics to enforce the type at compile-time:\n\nHashMap<Somekey, String> data = new HashMap<Somekey, String>();\ndata.put(somekey, \"asdfdsafdsf\");\nString value = data.get(somekey);\n\nThis way, you won't need to cast the value and you will avoid the ClassCastException. \n<<<explanation>>>: The reason why this issue occurs on Android 2.3 and lower is because the type inference for generics was improved in later versions of Java. In older versions, the raw type of HashMap is used, which allows any type of object to be stored. As a result, when you try to retrieve the value, it may not be of the expected type, leading to a ClassCastException. By specifying the types explicitly or using generics, you can ensure type safety and avoid such issues."
