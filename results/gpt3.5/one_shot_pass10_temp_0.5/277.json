In the hasNext() method, we check the value of \"skip\" and return it.hasNext() accordingly. If \"skip\" is true, we don't call it.next() and just return it.hasNext(). If \"skip\" is false, we call it.next() to skip one element and then set \"skip\" to true before returning it.hasNext(). \n\nIn the next() method, we first check the value of \"skip\". If it's true, we set \"skip\" to false and return it.next(). If it's false, we call it.next() to skip one element, set \"skip\" to true, and then return it.next() to get the next element after the skipped one.
