It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: How do I write exceptions to a text file? (JAVA): :I am supposed to Use Scanner to read int values from a file \u201cinput.txt\u201d, Read until end of file is reached, Write all program output to a file \u201coutput.txt\u201d, Write all exceptions to a file \u201cerror.txt\u201d, and Output each number read.I understand exceptions for the most part, but I do not understand how to write all exceptions to a text file in Java...\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
