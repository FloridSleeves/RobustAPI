You can define a custom event class, let's say MessageEvent, and fire this event whenever your managed bean receives a message. Each implementation of the SocialNetworkService can observe this event and decide whether to transmit the message based on their own rules.\n\nHere's an example of how you can implement this using CDI:\n\n1. Define the custom event class:\n```\npublic class MessageEvent {\n    private String message;\n\n    public MessageEvent(String message) {\n        this.message = message;\n    }\n\n    public String getMessage() {\n        return message;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n2. Fire the event in your managed bean:\n```\n@Inject\nprivate Event<MessageEvent> messageEvent;\n\npublic void receiveMessage(String message) {\n    messageEvent.fire(new MessageEvent(message));\n}\n```\n\n3. Implement the SocialNetworkService interfaces and observe the event:\n```\n@ApplicationScoped\npublic class TwitterService implements SocialNetworkService {\n\n    public void transmitMessage(@Observes MessageEvent event) {\n        // Check if the message should be transmitted via Twitter\n        // Transmit the message if the conditions are met\n    }\n}\n\n@ApplicationScoped\npublic class FacebookService implements SocialNetworkService {\n\n    public void transmitMessage(@Observes MessageEvent event) {\n        // Check if the message should be transmitted via Facebook\n        // Transmit the message if the conditions are met\n    }\n}\n\n// Implement other SocialNetworkService interfaces in a similar way\n```\n\nBy using the Events pattern, each implementation of the SocialNetworkService can independently decide whether to transmit the message based on their own rules. This allows for flexibility and scalability as you can easily add more implementations without modifying the existing code.\n\nNote: CDI is a Java EE standard and is supported by Weld, which is a popular CDI implementation."
