Each node in the ArrayList will correspond to its index position in the linked list.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n// Create an ArrayList to map the nodes\nList<Node> nodeList = new ArrayList<>();\n\n// Traverse the Doubly Linked List and add nodes to the ArrayList\nNode currentNode = head; // Assuming 'head' is the reference to the first node\nwhile (currentNode != null) {\n    nodeList.add(currentNode);\n    currentNode = currentNode.next; // Assuming 'next' is the reference to the next node\n}\n\nNow, you can access any node in the linked list using the ArrayList in O(1) time. For example, to access the node at index 5:\n\nNode nodeAtIndex5 = nodeList.get(5);\n\nTo move a node with ID 5 to the end of the list in O(1) time, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Get the node with ID 5 using the ArrayList: \n   Node nodeToMove = nodeList.get(5);\n\n2. Update the previous and next references of the adjacent nodes:\n   nodeToMove.prev.next = nodeToMove.next;\n   nodeToMove.next.prev = nodeToMove.prev;\n\n3. Update the references of the node to be moved:\n   nodeToMove.prev = tail; // Assuming 'tail' is the reference to the last node\n   nodeToMove.next = null;\n\n4. Update the references of the adjacent nodes:\n   tail.next = nodeToMove;\n   tail = nodeToMove; // Update the 'tail' reference\n\nNote: Make sure to handle the cases when the node to be moved is the head or tail of the linked list separately.\n\nPlease note that while mapping the nodes to an ArrayList allows for O(1) time access to any node, it also requires additional space to store the ArrayList."
