This causes the `NoSuchElementException` because `s2` does not have any more elements after the first call to `s2.next()`.\n\nTo fix this issue, you can modify the innermost `while` loop as follows:\n\n```java\nwhile (s2.hasNext()) {\n    for (int x = 0; x < count; x++) {\n        if (s2.hasNext()) {\n            String b = s2.next();\n        }\n    }\n    if (s2.hasNext()) {\n        c += s2.next();\n        c += \" \";\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis ensures that `s2.next()` is only called once per iteration of the `while` loop, preventing the `NoSuchElementException`.\n\nAdditionally, make sure to close the `s2` scanner after the innermost `while` loop to avoid any resource leaks."
