The ServletContext object is available to all servlets in a web application and can be accessed using the getServletContext() method. From the ServletContext object, you can then retrieve the Servlet object using the getServlet(String name) method, passing in the name of the servlet as a parameter. Here is an example of how you can get the Servlet object:\n\n// Get the ServletContext object\nServletContext servletContext = getServletContext();\n\n// Get the Servlet object\nPushServlet pushServlet = (PushServlet) servletContext.getServlet(\"PushServlet\");\n\n// Call methods on the Servlet object\npushServlet.enviarMensagem(mensagem);\n\nAs for whether this is the ideal approach for your problem, it depends on your specific requirements and design. This approach allows any object to send a message to the clients through the PushServlet, but it also introduces potential thread synchronization issues. You need to make sure that the methods in the PushServlet are properly synchronized to avoid any race conditions. Additionally, using a separate thread for each request may not be scalable for a large number of clients. Consider using a more scalable approach such as using asynchronous servlets or a message queue system."

This will give you a reference to the servlet object that you can then use to call its methods.\nHowever, it is important to note that creating a new instance of the servlet class may not always be the ideal approach, especially in a multi-threaded environment. Instead, you may consider using a dependency injection framework like Spring or CDI to manage the lifecycle of the servlet and inject it into the objects that need to send messages to clients. This way, you can ensure that there is only one instance of the servlet and it can be easily accessed by other objects.\nAdditionally, it is worth mentioning that using a separate thread to handle the SSE communication may not be the most efficient approach. Servlet containers like Tomcat already provide built-in support for handling asynchronous requests, which can be a better option for implementing server-sent events. You can refer to the documentation of your servlet container for more information on how to implement asynchronous servlets."

The initial test codes worked like a charm, but wasn't flexible enought to send messages from different parts of my application. So I've rewrite the code in a way that all objects that has a reference to Servlet object could send a message to the clients:public class PushServlet extends HttpServlet {    private Thread threadServlet;    private boolean processando=true;    private MensagemSSEBean mensagem;    @Override    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {        threadServlet=Thread.currentThread();        response.setContentType(\"text/event-stream; charset=utf-8\");        while (processando){            if(!pausarThread())                break;            enviarMensagemParaOCliente(response.getWriter());        }        enviarMensagemDeFechamento(response.getWriter());    }    private void enviarMensagemParaOCliente(PrintWriter saida) {        ConversorMensagemSSE conversor = new ConversorMensagemSSE();        saida.print(conversor.converter(mensagem));        saida.flush();    }    private synchronized void enviarMensagemDeFechamento(PrintWriter saida) {        mensagem.setMensagem(\"#FECHAR_CONEXAO#\");        enviarMensagemParaOCliente(saida);        saida.close();    }    public synchronized void enviarMensagem(MensagemSSEBean mensagem) throws IOException {        this.mensagem=mensagem;        threadServlet.notifyAll();    }    public synchronized void finalizar(){        processando=false;    }    private boolean pausarThread() {        try {            threadServlet.wait();            return true;        } catch (InterruptedException e) {            e.printStackTrace();          }        return false;    }}As you can see, I pause the Servlet Thread until something call \"enviarMensagem\".
