You can use a padding scheme like PKCS5Padding or PKCS7Padding to achieve this.\n\nHere is an example of how you can modify your code to use PKCS5Padding:\n\n// Server side code\ncipher2 = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\");\nsecretKeySpec = new SecretKeySpec(decryptedText, \"AES\");\nIvParameterSpec ivParameterSpec = new IvParameterSpec(iv); // iv is the initialization vector\ncipher2.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secretKeySpec, ivParameterSpec);\nfeedback = \"Your answer is wrong\".getBytes();\nbyte[] encryptedFeedback = cipher2.doFinal(feedback);\ndos.writeInt(encryptedFeedback.length);\ndos.write(encryptedFeedback);\n\n// Client side code\nresult_len = din.readInt();\nbyte[] result_Bytes = new byte[result_len];\ndin.readFully(result_Bytes);\ncipher2 = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\");\ncipher2.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, aesKey, ivParameterSpec);\nbyte[] decryptedResult = cipher2.doFinal(result_Bytes);\nSystem.out.println(new String(decryptedResult));\nIn this example, we use AES in CBC mode with PKCS5Padding. The initialization vector (iv) is used to ensure that the encrypted data is different each time it is encrypted.\n\nNote: Make sure you generate a new random iv for each encryption operation and send it along with the encrypted data, so that the client can use the same iv for decryption."
