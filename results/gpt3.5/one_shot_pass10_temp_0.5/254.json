It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Java copy part of InputStream to OutputStream: :I have a file with 3236000 bytes and I want to read 2936000 from start and write to an OutputStreamInputStream is = new FileInputStream(file1);OutputStream os = new FileOutputStream(file2);AFunctionToCopy(is,os,0,2936000); /* a function or sourcecode to write input stream 0to2936000 bytes */I can read and write byte by byte, but it's to slow (i think) from buffered readingHow can do I copy it?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
