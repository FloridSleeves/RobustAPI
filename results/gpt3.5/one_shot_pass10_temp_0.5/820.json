But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: FileWriter don't write string with 78510 length: :I have a problem, i have a list of MyObject, and i want to write this in a file in  json.So i parse my list with gson to json and i write the string in file, but nothing have been write the file was create but is empty (0 octet).if my List<MyObject> have 60 item and i parse it to json, the string have a  14482 lenght, and the Filewriter work fine.if my List<MyObject> have 60+ item and i parse it to json the Filewriter do nothing, and the file is empty.For exemple if my list have 300 item the length is 78909Here is my code for write my list in file: private void saveTrace() {    try {        Log.d(mapsActivity.TAGDEBUG, \"Sauvegarde de la trace automatique\");        Log.d(mapsActivity.TAGDEBUG, \"Nombre de point compris dans la trace automatique: \" + String.valueOf(listBeanTraceUser.size()));        String sFileNameTrace = \"trace_\" + currentDate + \".xml\";        File traceFile = new File(root, sFileNameTrace);        MediaScannerConnection.scanFile(mapsActivity, new String[]{traceFile.getAbsolutePath()}, null, null);        FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(traceFile);        BufferedWriter out = new BufferedWriter(writer, 32768);        String jsonStringTrace = gson.toJson(listBeanTraceUser);        Log.d(mapsActivity.TAGDEBUG, \"lenght jsonStringTrace : \" + String.valueOf(jsonStringTrace.length()));        out.write(jsonStringTrace);        out.close();    } catch (Exception e) {        Log.d(mapsActivity.TAGDEBUG, \"Erreur lors de la Sauvegarde de la trace automatique\");        e.printStackTrace();    }}\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
