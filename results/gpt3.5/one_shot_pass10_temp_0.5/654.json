It uses the KeyEvent.getKeyCode() method to get the key code of the pressed or released key, and the KeyEvent.getWhen() method to get the timestamp of the event. The code keeps track of whether a key is currently pressed using a boolean variable \"keyPressed\". When a key is pressed, it checks if \"keyPressed\" is false, indicating that it is the first press event for that key. If it is the first press event, it sets \"keyPressed\" to true and prints the key code and timestamp. When a key is released, it sets \"keyPressed\" to false and prints the key code and timestamp.

I also would like a pure Java approach the works on Linux, Mac OS and Windows.Requirements:When the user presses some key I want to know what key is that;When the user releases some key, I want to know what key is that;I want to ignore the system auto repeat options: I want to receive just one keypress event for each key press and just one key release event for each key release;If possible, I would use items 1 to 3 to know if the user is holding more than one key at a time (i.e, she hits 'a' and without releasing it, she hits \"Enter\").The problem I'm facing in Java is that under Linux, when the user holds some key, there are many keyPress and keyRelease events being fired (because of the keyboard repeat feature).I've tried some approaches with no success:Get the last time a key event occurred - in Linux, they seem to be zero for key repeat, however, in Mac OS they are not;Consider an event only if the current keyCode is different from the last one - this way the user can't hit twice the same key in a row;Here is the basic (non working) part of code:import java.awt.event.KeyListener;public class Example implements KeyListener {public void keyTyped(KeyEvent e) {}public void keyPressed(KeyEvent e) {    System.out.println(\"KeyPressed: \"+e.getKeyCode()+\", ts=\"+e.getWhen());}public void keyReleased(KeyEvent e) {    System.out.println(\"KeyReleased: \"+e.getKeyCode()+\", ts=\"+e.getWhen());}}When a user holds a key (i.e, 'p') the system shows:KeyPressed:  80, ts=1253637271673KeyReleased: 80, ts=1253637271923KeyPressed:  80, ts=1253637271923KeyReleased: 80, ts=1253637271956KeyPressed:  80, ts=1253637271956KeyReleased: 80, ts=1253637271990KeyPressed:  80, ts=1253637271990KeyReleased: 80, ts=1253637272023KeyPressed:  80, ts=1253637272023...At least under Linux, the JVM keeps resending all the key events when a key is being hold. To make things more difficult, on my system (Kubuntu 9.04 Core 2 Duo) the timestamps keep changing. The JVM sends a key new release and new key press with the same timestamp. This makes it hard to know when a key is really released.Any ideas?Thanks\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:"
