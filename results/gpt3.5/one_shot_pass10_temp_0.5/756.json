That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: How Can I Create A File In Java?: :I am working on a program that needs a lot of app data. I am trying to create a function that creates a file with the path/file name of the string path. Here's my code:public static void CreateFile(String path) throws FileNotFoundException, UnsupportedEncodingException {    PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(path, \"UTF-8\");    writer.close();}What did I do wrong? Shouldn't it create a file? \nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
