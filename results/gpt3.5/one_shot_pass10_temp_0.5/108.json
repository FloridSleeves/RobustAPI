One way to do this is by assigning a unique identifier to each client when they connect to the server. Then, you can maintain a list of connected clients along with their identifiers.\n\nWhen you want to send a message to a specific client, you can iterate through the list of connected clients and check their identifiers. If the identifier matches the client you want to send the message to, you can send the message using the appropriate socket connection.\n\nHere is an example of how you can implement this:\n\n1. Maintain a list of connected clients with their identifiers:\n   List<Client> connectedClients = new ArrayList<>();\n\n2. When a client connects to the server, assign a unique identifier to the client and add it to the list of connected clients:\n   Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();\n   String clientId = generateUniqueId();\n   Client client = new Client(clientId, clientSocket);\n   connectedClients.add(client);\n\n3. When you want to send a message to a specific client, iterate through the list of connected clients and find the client with the matching identifier:\n   String clientIdToSend = \"client1\";\n   String messageToSend = \"Hello, client 1!\";\n   \n   for (Client client : connectedClients) {\n       if (client.getClientId().equals(clientIdToSend)) {\n           // Send the message to the client using the client's socket connection\n           DataOutputStream dataOutputStream = new DataOutputStream(client.getSocket().getOutputStream());\n           dataOutputStream.writeBytes(messageToSend);\n           break; // Exit the loop once the message is sent\n       }\n   }\n\nNote: This is a simplified example and may require additional error handling and synchronization depending on your specific use case.\n\n<<<explanation>>>: This code snippet demonstrates how to send a message to a specific client using sockets."

Maintain a list of connected clients on the server side.\n2. When a client connects to the server, add it to the list of connected clients.\n3. Assign a unique identifier to each client (e.g., client ID).\n4. When a client sends a message to the server, include the client ID in the message.\n5. Iterate through the list of connected clients and check if the client ID matches the intended recipient.\n6. If the client ID matches the intended recipient, send the message to that client using the DataOutputStream.write method.\n\nHere is an example code snippet to demonstrate this concept:\n\n```\n// Server side\nList<Client> connectedClients = new ArrayList<>();\n\n// When a client connects\nSocket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();\nDataInputStream dataInputStream = new DataInputStream(clientSocket.getInputStream());\nDataOutputStream dataOutputStream = new DataOutputStream(clientSocket.getOutputStream());\n\n// Add the client to the list of connected clients\nClient client = new Client(clientSocket, dataInputStream, dataOutputStream);\nconnectedClients.add(client);\n\n// When a message is received from a client\nString message = dataInputStream.readUTF();\nString recipientClientId = extractRecipientClientId(message);\n\nfor (Client connectedClient : connectedClients) {\n    if (connectedClient.getClientId().equals(recipientClientId)) {\n        connectedClient.getDataOutputStream().writeUTF(message);\n        break;\n    }\n}\n\n// Client side\nDataOutputStream dataOutputStream = new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());\ndataOutputStream.writeUTF(message);\n```\n\nIn this example, the `Client` class represents a connected client and contains the client socket, input stream, and output stream. The `extractRecipientClientId` method extracts the recipient client ID from the message.\n\nBy iterating through the list of connected clients and checking the recipient client ID, you can send messages to specific clients without sending them to others."
