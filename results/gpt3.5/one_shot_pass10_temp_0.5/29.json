I am confused how does it work? why doesn't it give error just like we get in java code? and most importantly, how does environment decide to which component it needs to invoke? I understand the process of id generation is automated, which gets added to R.java For instance, if we have same IDs, say \"image1\" in two XMLs, say \"layout1\" & \"layout2\". but in R.java it won't have 2 IDs. that means at a time it will reference only 1 component. In case we have to use 2 XMLs in an Activity, one as activity.setcontentview(layout1) and another as a PopupWindow.setContentView(layout2). What will happen in such case?\nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Activity.setContentView\n<<<code>>>: @Override\npublic void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n    Button myButton = (Button) findViewById(R.id.my_button);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You can findViewById of the current view hierarchy set to the activity. You cannot have same id for the view's in the same view tree. (must be unique).\nQuestion: AsyncTask onPostExecute UI Changes: :It is always the little things that stump me for hours.I have an onPostExecute method from an AsyncTask class that looks like so: @Override    protected void onPostExecute(String s) {                               super.onPostExecute(s);        showColumnCounts();        dataDownloadCompleteToast();    }The toast works just fine. However, my showColumnCounts() method refuses to work. It works just fine on the main thread. I use it during onCreate() just not here. I thought the onPostExecute ran on the UI thread?Here is my showColumnCounts() method if it is relevant. public void showColumnCounts() {    TextView totalView = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.totalColumn2);    TextView ignoredView = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.ignoredColumn2);    TextView rView = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.rColumn2);    Cursor c = myDB.getEmptyRColumn(\"\");    int count = c.getCount();    if (count == 0) {        c.close();        return;    }    String unread = String.valueOf(count);    String total = getTotalCount();    int tTotal = Integer.parseInt(total);    int r = tTotal - count;    String read = String.valueOf(r);    totalView.setText(total);    ignoredView.setText(unread);    rView.setText(read);    c.close();}I've been fiddling with it for a while now assuming the answer should be obvious but I'm calling uncle. Can't figure it.Edit***** 6/30I THINK I've found my problem. In my background thread I am using a parse.com method \"query.findInBackground\" which I assume is starting a third thread? I'm trying to update this to \"query.find\" and I'm hoping that will fix.\nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer:"
