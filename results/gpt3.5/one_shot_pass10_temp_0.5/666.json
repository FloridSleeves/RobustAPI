That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Exporting variables with multiple values?: :import java.util.*;import java.text.*;import java.io.*;public class AvgTime {static double hrs1;static double min1;public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException, FileNotFoundException {Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);System.out.print(\"How many times? \");int numOfTimes = in.nextInt();double hrTotal = 0;double minTotal = 0;for (int i = 1; i <= numOfTimes; i++){  System.out.println(\"\\nEnter time in military time notation: \");  System.out.print(\"Hour  \");  double hrs1 = in.nextDouble();  System.out.print(\"Minute  \");  double min1 = in.nextDouble();  hrTotal += hrs1;  minTotal += min1;}//calculate averagedouble avgHr1 = hrTotal/numOfTimes;double timeMin1 = Math.round(minTotal/numOfTimes);DecimalFormat df = new DecimalFormat(\"###\");String hours = df.format(avgHr1);String minutes = df.format(timeMin1);String time = hours+\":\"+minutes+\":\"+00;String mt = hours+minutes;    SimpleDateFormat fmtMil = new SimpleDateFormat(\"HH:mm:ss\");    Date inDate = fmtMil.parse(time, new ParsePosition(0));    SimpleDateFormat fmtAMPM = new SimpleDateFormat(\"hh:mm:ss aa\");    StringBuffer outDate = fmtAMPM.format(inDate, new StringBuffer(), new FieldPosition(0));System.out.println(\"\\nThe average time is \" + outDate+\"\\n\"+mt+\" in military time.\\n\\n\");    String copy = \"Copying...\";    Thread.sleep( 550 );    for( int i = 0; i < copy.length(); i++ ) {        System.out.print(copy.charAt( i ) );         try{ Thread.sleep( 105 ); }catch( Exception e ){}        }        PrintWriter p = new PrintWriter(\"Times.txt\");           p.println(hrs1+min1);            p.close();        System.out.println(\"\\nDone\\n\\n\\n\");            Thread.sleep( 550 );  }}I want it to export to a file the times entered by the user. For example if the user sets the numOfTimes to be 2, I will have 2 different values for hrs1 and min1.Say they enter: 1629 and 2018.I want the text file to display the hrs1 (16) and the min1 (29) just like 1629. But instead of the 'hrs1+min1' when I put hrs1+min1 it just exports '0.0'. I just want it to export \"1629\" and \"2018\".Why is this and how do I fix it?OutputHow many times? 2Enter time in military time notation: Hour  16Minute  29Enter time in military time notation: Hour  20Minute  18What should be exported:16292018\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
