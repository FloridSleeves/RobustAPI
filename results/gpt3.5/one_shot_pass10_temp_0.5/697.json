That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: I cant make the text file as read only mode in java: :package com.studytrails.tutorials.springremotingrmiserver;import java.lang.Object;import java.awt.Desktop;import java.io.*;import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;import org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext;import org.springframework.core.io.Resource;public class GreetingServiceImpl implements GreetingService {    @Override    public String getGreeting(String name) {        return \"Hello \" + name + \"!\";    }    public String getText() {        ApplicationContext appContext = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(new String[]{\"spring-config-server.xml\"});        Resource resource = appContext.getResource(\"file:D:\\\\text\\\\test.txt\");        StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();        try {            InputStream is = resource.getInputStream();            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(is));            File temp=File.createTempFile(\"output\", \".tmp\");            String filePath=temp.getAbsolutePath();            System.out.println(\"\"+filePath);            String tem=temp.getName();            String line;            PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(tem));            //System.out.println(\"\"+filePath);            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {                out.println(line);            }            temp.setReadOnly();            String[] cmd = {\"notepad\",tem};             Runtime runtime = Runtime.getRuntime();            Process proc = runtime.exec(cmd);            // proc.getInputStream();            out.close();            br.close();            //temp.deleteOnExit();            }        catch(IOException e) {            e.printStackTrace();        }        return builder.toString();    }}In above code I am not able to setReadonly(); command to temp file. File displayed with all options can you suggest how to make the temp file as not modified and even it is not able to save to another location. I need this file only displayed at run time of the program. During that time user does not change any content and it could not be save as  another location.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
