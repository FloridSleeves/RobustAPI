The `animation.work()` method is not being called continuously to update the frames of the explosion animation. You can add a call to `animation.work()` in a loop to continuously update the frames until the animation has played once.\n\nHere's an example of how you can modify the `animating()` method:\n\n```\npublic void animating() {\n    while (!animation.playedOnce()) {\n        animation.work();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis will continuously update the frames of the explosion animation until it has played once.\n\nAdditionally, make sure that you are calling the `animating()` method in the game loop or in a method that is continuously called when the player loses health."

If the player loses his health the explosion should be triggered. I made 3 Classes. Animation Class, an Explosion Class and GameActivity Class. I tried to only post the relevant pieces.I searched the internet but I could not find a solution to my problem. So I am asking you if you maybe see my mistake and could help me. If more code is needed I will edit it of course. Maybe I am just overlooking something. Animation Class{public void setFrames(Bitmap[] frames){this.frames = frames;currentFrame = 0;startTime = System.nanoTime();}public void setDelay(long d){delay = d;}public void setFrame(int i){currentFrame= i;}public void work(){long elapsed = (System.nanoTime()-startTime)/1000000;if(elapsed>delay){currentFrame++;startTime = System.nanoTime();}if(currentFrame == frames.length){currentFrame = 0;playedOnce = true; }}public Bitmap getImage(){return frames[currentFrame];}public int getFrame(){return currentFrame;}public boolean playedOnce(){return playedOnce; }}This is the relevant part of the Explosion Class:Bitmap[] image = new Bitmap[numFrames];//Bitmap has 4 * 4 framesfor (int i = 0; i < image.length; i++) {if (i % 4 == 0 && i > 0) row++;image[i] = Bitmap.createBitmap(spritesheet, (i - (4 * row)) * width,  row * height, width*4, height*4);}animation.setFrames(image);animation.setDelay(10);}public void animating() {if (!animation.playedOnce()) {animation.work(); }}If the player loses all his health I call the explosion in GameActivityif (player.getHealth() < 0) {// player bitmap disappearsdissapear = true;//game endsgameEnded=true;explosion = new Explosion(BitmapFactory.decodeResource(getResources(),   R.drawable.images),player.getX(),player.getY()-10,9,9,25);explosion.animating();\nPlease using this api: List.get.\nAnswer:"
