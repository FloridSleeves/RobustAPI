I am getting values using .values(). Now I want to access these values. Collection val = table.values();Iterator itr = val.iterator();long a  =   (long)itr.next();But when I try to get it, it gives me error because I can't convert from type object to long. How can I go around it?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
