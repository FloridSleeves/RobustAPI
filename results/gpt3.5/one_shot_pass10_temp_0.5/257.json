Read the Excel file using the Workbook class provided by Apache POI. You can use either HSSFWorkbook for .xls files or XSSFWorkbook for .xlsx files. Here's an example:\n\n```java\nFileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(\"path/to/your/excel/file.xlsx\");\nWorkbook workbook = new XSSFWorkbook(fis);\n```\n\n3. Get the sheet you want to parse from the Workbook. You can use either getSheetAt(index) or getSheet(sheetName) methods. Here's an example:\n\n```java\nSheet sheet = workbook.getSheetAt(0); // Assuming the first sheet is the one you want to parse\n```\n\n4. Iterate over the rows and cells of the sheet using nested loops.
