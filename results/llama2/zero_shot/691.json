to send Servlet response using Listner: :I am developing multi-threaded java sevlet having following scenarioData comes in different chunks and for that I only need to send response in last request.Data chunk forwarded to other classes for holding  data.public class RequestController extends HttpServlet implements ResponseHandler {    private ExecutorService pool;    public static ConcurrentHashMap<String, HttpServletResponse> cache;    static {        cache = new ConcurrentHashMap<String, HttpServletResponse>();    }protected void processRequest(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)            throws ServletException, IOException {        response.setContentType(\"text/html;charset=UTF-8\");        try {            BufferedReader br = request.getReader();            String msg = br.readLine();            br.close();            if (msg == null) {                msg = request.getParameter(\"request\");                //return;            }            String number = msg.substring(msg.indexOf(\"//\") + 2, msg.indexOf(\";\"));            System.out.println(\"number = \" + number);            cache.put(number, response);            System.out.println(\"Request received\");            msg = URLDecoder.decode(msg, \"UTF-8\");            System.out.println(msg);            pool.submit(new DuplicaterRequestHandler(msg, this));        } catch (Exception e) {            e.printStackTrace(System.out);        } finally {        }    }}This is my servlet code.cache is a static storage which I am using to send resonse after receiving of all requestI have a listner as well which tells the sevlet that request is completedpublic interface ResponseHandler {    public void sendResponse(String number, String data);}and its implementation in RequestController is @Override    public void sendResponse(String number, String data) {        System.out.print(number);        System.out.println(cache.containsKey(number));        if (cache.containsKey(number)) {            try {                PrintWriter pr = cache.get(number).getWriter();                pr.println(data);                pr.close();                cache.remove(number);                System.out.println(\"response sent.\");                System.out.println(\"data:\" + data);            } catch (Exception e) {                e.printStackTrace(System.out);                System.out.println(e.getMessage());            }        }    }all is looking good but its throw a exception some time, not every time, which is unknown to me.java.lang.NullPointerException    at org.apache.coyote.http11.InternalOutputBuffer.realWriteBytes(InternalOutputBuffer.java:215)    at
