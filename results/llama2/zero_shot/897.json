My key is Date and the value is a String. So I selected a TreeMap.Now,Is the following iterator is sorted according similar to the TreeMaps key. I tried few loops but still have a doubtIterator<Date> iter = policyMap.keySet().iterator();Is there any way to get the next key without incrementing the iterator's index.Is there any equalant way than this policyMap.higherKey(cpDate)) before java 6.Finally I ashamed of my self that I tried for following too.TreeMap<Date, String> policySubMap = new TreeMap<Date, String>policyMap.tailMap(cpDate));policySubMap.remove(policySubMap.firstKey());System.out.println(\" | amount > \" + policySubMap.firstKey());This is my complete code :public void controller(){TreeMap<Date, String> policyMap = new TreeMap<Date, String>();Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance();policyMap.put(addDate(cal, 2).getTime(), \"Amount is 10\");policyMap.put(addDate(cal, 10).getTime(), \"Amount is 10\");policyMap.put(addDate(cal, -10).getTime(), \"Amount is -10\");policyMap.put(addDate(cal, 11).getTime(), \"Amount is 11\");policyMap.put(addDate(cal, -11).getTime(), \"Amount is -11\");policyMap.put(addDate(cal, -12).getTime(), \"Amount is -12\");Iterator<Date> iter = policyMap.keySet().iterator();while (iter.hasNext()) {    Date cpDate = iter.next();    System.out.print(\"From \"+cpDate + \" to \" + policyMap.get(cpDate));//      if(iter.hasNext())System.out.println(\" | amount > \" + policyMap.higherKey(cpDate)); // This is not supporting in before java 6        if(iter.hasNext()){            TreeMap<Date, String> policySubMap = new TreeMap<Date, String>(policyMap.tailMap(cpDate));            policySubMap.remove(policySubMap.firstKey());            System.out.println(\" | amount > \" + policySubMap.firstKey());        }    else System.out.println(\"Checking date\");    }}public Calendar addDate(Calendar cal, int amount) {    cal.add(Calendar.DATE, amount);    return cal;}\nPlease using this api: SortedMap.firstKey.\nAnswer:", "response": "I wanna sort a collection of dates value pair.

You're asking about the `higherKey` method, but you're not using it in your code.  You're using `next` and `hasNext`.  You're also using `firstKey` and `remove` methods.  What's the question?\n\nComment: I'm not sure what you're asking.  You're asking about the `higherKey` method, but you're not using it in your code.  You're using `next` and `hasNext`.
