In the java documentation we can read that if the Collection length is greater than the sortedList, a new array is created with the good size, and if the collection length is smaller than the sortedList, the object following the last object of the collection is set to null.The project I am working on does not let me use null values in the sorted list, so I am implementing the method differently, using a new sortedList and the toArray() method:public <T> T[] toArray(T[] a){    SortedList sort = new SortedList();    for(Object o : a)    {        sort.add(o);    }    return (T[])sort.toArray();}Would this be a good way to implement this method or should I expect errors using it like that?Thank you for your time.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: Iterator.next()\n<<<explanation>>>: Iterator.next() returns the next element in the iterator.\nQuestion: I have a class that implements the Iterator interface.
