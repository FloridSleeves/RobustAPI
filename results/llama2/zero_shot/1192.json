Implement the function to rearrange and return the same list so that all the vowels occupy the first half of the list and all the consonants occupy the second half. Note: Do not create a new list, modify the existing list.Relative ordering of vowels and consonants should not change among themselves.You may assume that the list is of even length and half the nodes contain vowels and the other half contain consonants.If the list is NULL, then return NULL.Example:Input:  a -> k -> r -> i -> t -> e -> o -> mOutput:  a - >i - > e -> o -> k -> r -> t -> mExplanation:  The consonants k and r in the first half of the list are moved to the second half of the list, while vowels e and o in the second half of the list are moved to first half of the list, keeping the relative ordering same.My Code performs the Operation correctly but does not satisfy the point 2 in note. The relative ordering of Elements changes in my output as I am swapping consonents with the Vowels. My Code is below....I just need how to make my code work for that case also.import java.io.*;import java.lang.*;import java.util.*;public class Node{    public char data;    public Node next;    public static Node rearrange(Node head)    {        Node start=new Node();        Node curr=new Node();        Node temp=new Node();        start=curr=head;        int begin=0;        int flag=0;        while(head.next!=null)        {             if(head.data=='a'||head.data=='e'||head.data=='i'||head.data=='o'||head.data=='u')            {      // no change            }            else            {                curr=head.next;                do                {                     System.out.println(\"CURR \"+curr.data+\" HEAD \"+head.data);                    if(curr.data=='a'||curr.data=='e'||curr.data=='i'||curr.data=='o'||curr.data=='u')                    {                     temp.data=curr.data;                     curr.data=head.data;                     head.data=temp.data;                     break;                    }                }while((curr=curr.next)!=null);            }            head=head.next;        }        while(start.next!=null)        {            System.out.print(start.data+\"->\");            start=start.next;        }        System.out.print(start.data);        return start;    }    public static void main(String args[])    {      Scanner s=new Scanner(System.in);      int count=0;      System.out.println(\"Enter the number of characters:\");      int length=s.nextInt();      System.out.println(\"Enter the character seperated by ->\");      String inp=s.next();      StringTokenizer st=new StringTokenizer(inp,\"->\");      Node[] a=new Node[inp.length()];      for(int i=0;st.hasMoreElements();i++)      {        a[i]=new Node();        a[i].data=(st.nextToken().toString()).charAt(0);        count++;      }      a[count-1].next=null;      for(int i=0;i<(count-1);i++)      {        a[i].next=a[i+1];      }      Node start =new Node();      start=rearrange(a[0]);    }}\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:", "response": "The problem is that you are not using the StringTokenizer correctly. You are using it to split the string, but you are not using the returned tokens to do anything.\nThe StringTokenizer class has a method called nextToken() that returns the next token in the string. You can use this method to iterate through the string and extract the tokens.\nFor example, if you have a string \"Hello, my name is John\", you can use the nextToken() method to extract the tokens \"Hello\", \"my\", \"name\", and \"John\".\nIn your code, you are using the nextToken() method to extract the first token in the string, but you are not using the returned token to do anything. You are just assigning it to a variable and then discarding it.\nTo fix this, you need to use the returned token to do something. For example, you could use it to extract the first character of the string, or you could use it to extract the first word in the string.\nHere is an example of how you could use the nextToken() method to extract the first character of the string:\nStringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(\"Hello, my name is John\");\nSystem.out.println(st.nextToken());\nIn this example, the nextToken() method is called to extract the first token in the string, which is \"Hello\". The nextToken() method returns the next token in the string, which is \"my\". The nextToken() method is called again to extract the next token in the string, which is \"name\".
