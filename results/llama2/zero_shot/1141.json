My problem is that I am having trouble figuring out how to grab a specific piece of data out of a line with a buffered file reader. I know how to get the line, but parsing the data is the mystery. I have placed my code below in case it may help give more context. Thanks!EDIT: Please bear with me. I'm literally within my first month of learning Java. I have to use buffered reader.
