It's pretty simple - it sends some data to a UDP port and looks at the result. I'm not a Python guy, and haven't done too much socket programming, but I've figured out the translation of everything except one line:packet = (b'\\x0C\\x15\\x33\\x00' + os.urandom(4) + (b'\\x00' * 38) + struct.pack('<H', len(enccmd)) + enccmd).ljust(512, b'\\x00')enccmd is a string containing a command that was encoded previously/This is building the data packet that's going to be sent. I know that this translates into the creation of a DatagramPacket object, I just don't know how to do it.Can anyone help?\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "DataOutputStream.write(packet, 0, packet.length);\nQuestion: Translate Python into Java: :I'm trying to translate a little Python script into Java.
