{"api": "Iterator.next", "prompt": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Why does the Iterator not \"Move Next\" in a for loop: :I'm learning to iterate, and have implemented an Iterator on my 'CStickChart' Class using the following private property:  private List<CStick> cStickCollection = new ArrayList<CStick>();and then implementing the method to return CSticks:  public Iterator<CStick> iterator() {    return this.cStickCollection.iterator();  }Now when I try and iterate through it, I'm able to do so with the assigned localCStick but calling the next() method on the CStickChart Iterator doesn't do what I expected it to. I expected it to give me the next CStick in my CStickChart (hence when I call the getEPIC I was expecting it to give me the next EPIC along).// Print the EPIC out of the Array using the iteratorfor (CStick localCStick : testCStickChart) {  System.out.println(localCStick.getEPIC());  //The below line doesn't return the next CStick and I'm not sure why  System.out.println(\"next EPIC is \" + testCStickChart.iterator().next().getEPIC());}Please could someone explain why this is not the case (it always returns the first EPIC)\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "The reason is that the iterator is not a random access iterator.
