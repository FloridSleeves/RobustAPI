Let's name it byteSchmeName.After that, I will convert lastModifiedDate to byteArray as well. let's name that as well to byteLMD.Now what's the best way to concatenate these three byteArrays together.avroBinaryValue + byteSchemaName + byteLMDSecondly, after concatenating these three byteArrays together, I want to split the resulting byteArrays in such a way such that I will be able to get all the three respective byteArrays properly...Is it possible to do that? Any help will be appreciated.NOTE:-All the three byteArrays value will be different in different scenarios.. I am looking the most efficient way to store the resulting byteArrays in such a way such that it doesn't take that much space on the disk. I dont want to serialize it again since avroBinaryValue that I am getting is coming from Avro Data Serialization.. So I want to convert the other two things as well in ByteArray so that I can merge all three together into a single ByteArray.\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "DataOutputStream.write(avroBinaryValue);DataOutputStream.write(byteSchemaName);DataOutputStream.write(byteLMD);\nQuestion: I have a ByteArray value as avroBinaryValue , Schema Name value as String schemaName and Last Modified Date value as lastModifiedDate in long.byte[] avroBinaryValue = os.toByteArray();String schemaName = \"DEMOGRAPHIC\";long lastModifiedDate = \"1379811105109\";Now I am planning to convert schemaName into byteArray as well.
