Create R12|R21|R1|R2|R3    # making sure R12 is before R1    my $regex = join \"|\",                sort { length($b) <=> length($a) }                keys %$map;    my $ts = time;    foreach my $file (@$files) {        my $data = read_file($file);        $data =~ s/\\b($regex)\\b/$map{$1}/g;        rename $file, \"$file.$ts\";       #
