Now I want to implement an iterator() that iterates over this collection such that on iteration it gives out the corresponding ColValue from each HColumn.This object HColumn<ColName, ColValue> is defined in an external library used by my java application.How can I do that, if possible ?Currently, to create such an iterable, I had been creating a new list altogether containing corresponding ColValues which I guess is not good thing, in terms of performance & efficiency.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "You can use the Iterator.next() method to get the next element in the iterator.\nQuestion: Implementing such an iterator?: :I have a list (an ArrayList, infact) of type HColumn<ColName, ColValue>.
