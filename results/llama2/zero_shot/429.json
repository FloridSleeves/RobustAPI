I've heard iteration in the best, so I've done the following:    Collection<Integer> c = new HashSet<Integer>();    Random r = new Random();    for (int i = 0; i < 100000; i++){        c.add(r.nextInt());    }    Iterator<Integer> i = c.iterator();    int random = r.nextInt(c.size());    int num = 0;    int count = 1;    while(i.hasNext()){        num = i.next();        if (count == random){            break;        }        count++;    }    System.out.println(num);It works fine, as far as I can tell and only takes a couple of milliseconds to complete. However, I've been told that the above is overcomplicating the problem. I know you can convert the collection to an array or in Java 8 you can use streams.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: Integer num = i.next();\n<<<explanation>>>: This will return the next element in the collection.\nQuestion: Get Random Entry From Collection: :What's the best way to get a random element from a Collection?
