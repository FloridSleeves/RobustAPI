Now half of the work is yet to be done as i want to calculate the number of rows in a particular column. Possible solution could be using 2d array and storing column index and the total rows or using map, etc. How i can achieve this? Java code is provided here. I'm getting right count(column count) for my demo file. Please modify/suggest changes as required.(edit): i've used hasp map to calculate store column index as key and row count as value, but it wasnt working, may be the applied logic was wrong. Well, if i want to accomplish this by using Hash Map, how i can store number of rows in a particular column(while iterating) as a value Java Code:import java.io.File;import java.io.FileInputStream;import java.io.FileNotFoundException;import java.io.IOException;import java.util.HashMap;import java.util.Iterator;import org.apache.poi.ss.formula.functions.Column;import org.apache.poi.ss.usermodel.Cell;import org.apache.poi.ss.usermodel.Row;import org.apache.poi.xssf.usermodel.XSSFRow;import org.apache.poi.xssf.usermodel.XSSFSheet;import org.apache.poi.xssf.usermodel.XSSFWorkbook;public class ExcelRead {    static int colrange=1000;    public static void main(String[] args) {        HashMap hm=new HashMap();        int count=0;    try {        FileInputStream file = new FileInputStream(new File(\"C:/Users/vinayakp/Desktop/Demo2.xlsx\"));        XSSFWorkbook workbook = new XSSFWorkbook(file);        XSSFSheet sheet = workbook.getSheetAt(0);        Iterator<Row> rowIterator = sheet.iterator();        while(rowIterator.hasNext()) {            Row row = rowIterator.next();            Iterator<Cell> cellIterator = row.cellIterator();            while(cellIterator.hasNext()) {                Cell cell = cellIterator.next();                switch(cell.getCellType()) {                    case Cell.CELL_TYPE_BOOLEAN:                        System.out.print(cell.getBooleanCellValue() + \"\\t\\t\");                        break;                    case Cell.CELL_TYPE_NUMERIC:                        System.out.print(cell.getNumericCellValue() + \"\\t\\t\");                        break;                    case Cell.CELL_TYPE_STRING:                        System.out.print(cell.getStringCellValue() + \"\\t\\t\");                        break;                }            }            System.out.println(\"\");        }        for(Row r:sheet)        {            short minColIx=r.getFirstCellNum();            short maxColIx=r.getLastCellNum();            for(short colIx=minColIx;colIx<maxColIx;colIx++) {                Cell c= r.getCell(colIx);                if(c!=null) {                    if(c.getCellType()== Cell.CELL_TYPE_STRING||c.getCellType() == Cell.CELL_TYPE_NUMERIC||c.getCellType() == Cell.CELL_TYPE_BOOLEAN) {                        count++; ---// can i use hashcode in here to get the key and value pair? key=column index value=total number of rows in that column                            }                     }                    else break;                }            }        System.out.println(\"\\nTotal Number of columns are:\\t\"+count);        System.out.println(hm);        file.close();        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {        e.printStackTrace();    } catch (IOException ae) {        ae.printStackTrace();    }}}\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "I'm not sure what you're trying to do, but I think you're looking for something like this:\n\n\\begin{code}\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<Integer, Integer>();\n    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n        map.put(i, i);\n    }\n    System.out.println(map.size());\n}\n\\end{code}\n\nComment: i've used hasp map to calculate store column index as key and row count as value, but it wasnt working, may be the applied logic was wrong.
