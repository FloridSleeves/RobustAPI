I have a class that has a method that takes a string and returns a string. The method is called \"getString\". The method is supposed to take a string and return a string that is the same as the string but with the first letter capitalized. For example, if the string is \"hello\", the method should return \"Hello\". I have a test class that has a method that calls the \"getString\" method. The test class is supposed to test the \"getString\" method. The test class has a method that takes a string and returns a string. The method is called \"testString\".
