I have a class called \"Client\" and a class called \"Server\". The Server class has a method called \"sendMessage\" which takes a String as a parameter. The Client class has a method called \"receiveMessage\" which takes a String as a parameter. The problem is that when I run the program, the Client class receives the message but the Server class doesn't. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. Here is the code for the Client class: public class Client { public static void main(String[] args) { Socket client = new Socket(\"localhost\", 8080); BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(client.getInputStream())); String message = in.readLine(); System.out.println(message); } }\nThe problem is that you are not sending the message from the server to the client. You are sending the message from the client to the server.\nQuestion: I have a problem with my code. I have a class called \"Client\" and a class called \"Server\".
