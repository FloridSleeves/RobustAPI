The server takes an input file from clients. Linux has end of line char LF, while Mac has end of line char CR, andWindows has end of line char CR+LFThe server needs as end of line char LF. Using java, I want to ensure that the file will always use the linux eol char LF. How can I achieve it?\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "DataOutputStream.write(char[] cbuf, int off, int len)\nThe write method writes len bytes from the given array into the output stream.
