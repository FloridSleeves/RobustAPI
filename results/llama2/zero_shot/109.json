But for some reason, Java is throwing a connection reset exception when doing input.read(). Could someone please tell me whats going on?Sender:private static Socket socket;public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {    socket = new Socket(\"localhost\", 25565);    String Password = \"1234\";    ByteBuffer Buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(1 + Password.getBytes().length);    Buffer.put((byte) 0x00);    Buffer.putShort((short) Password.getBytes().length);    Buffer.put(Password.getBytes());    DataOutputStream output = new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());    output.write(Buffer.array());}public static void sendBytes(byte[] myByteArray) throws IOException {    DataOutputStream output = new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());    output.write(\"LOL\".getBytes());    output.flush();}Receiver:public static void main(String[] args) {    try {        ServerSocket ServerSocket = new ServerSocket(25565);        System.out.println(\"Waiting for connection...\");        Socket socket = ServerSocket.accept();        DataInputStream Input = new DataInputStream(new BufferedInputStream(socket.getInputStream()));        System.out.println(Input.read());        ServerSocket.close();        socket.close();    } catch (Exception e) {        if(e instanceof SocketTimeoutException) {            System.out.println(\"THE SOCKET TIMED OUT!\");        }        else {            e.printStackTrace();        }    }}Stack trace:java.net.SocketException: Connection resetat java.net.SocketInputStream.read(SocketInputStream.java:189)at java.net.SocketInputStream.read(SocketInputStream.java:121)at java.io.BufferedInputStream.fill(BufferedInputStream.java:246)at java.io.BufferedInputStream.read(BufferedInputStream.java:265)at java.io.FilterInputStream.read(FilterInputStream.java:83)at net.networking.Receiver.main(Receiver.java:17)NOTE: Yes, I do know that just using input.read() will not get the whole ByteBuffer array I'm trying to send. But right now I just want to read the first byte and print it out to the console.\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "You are using the wrong API.
