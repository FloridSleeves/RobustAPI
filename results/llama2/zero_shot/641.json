If I had a frequency requirement of 4 it would return 4 as my mode.I do have a set of code that is working the way I want, and returning what I am expecting, but I feel like there should be a more efficient way to accomplish this, or an existing library that would help me do the same.  Attached is my code, I'd be interested in thoughts / comments on different approaches I should have taken....I have the iterations listed to limit how far  the precision can degrade.public static double findMode(double[] r, int frequencyReq){    double mode = 0d;    int frequency = 0;    int iterations = 4;    HashMap<Double, BigDecimal> counter = new HashMap<Double, BigDecimal>();    while(frequency < frequencyReq && iterations > 0){        String roundFormatString = \"#.\";        for(int j=0; j<iterations; j++){            roundFormatString += \"#\";        }        DecimalFormat roundFormat = new DecimalFormat(roundFormatString);        for(int i=0; i<r.length; i++){            double element = Double.valueOf(roundFormat.format(r[i]));            if(!counter.containsKey(element))                counter.put(element, new BigDecimal(0));            counter.put(element,counter.get(element).add(new BigDecimal(1)));        }        for(Double key : counter.keySet()){            if(counter.get(key).compareTo(new BigDecimal(frequency))>0){                mode = key;                frequency = counter.get(key).intValue();                log.debug(\"key: \" + key + \" Count: \" + counter.get(key));            }        }        iterations--;    }    return mode;}EditAnother way to rephrase the question, per Paulo's comment: the goal is to locate a number where in the neighborhood are at least frequency array elements, with the radius of the neighborhood being as small as possible. \nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:", "response": "I think you can use the following code:\n\n\\begin{code}\npublic static double findMode(double[] r, int frequencyReq) {\n    double mode = 0d;\n    int frequency = 0;\n    int iterations = 4;\n    HashMap<Double, BigDecimal> counter = new HashMap<Double, BigDecimal>();\n    while (frequency < frequencyReq && iterations > 0) {\n        String roundFormatString = \"#.\";\n        for (int j = 0; j < iterations; j++) {\n            roundFormatString += \"#\";\n        }\n        DecimalFormat roundFormat = new DecimalFormat(roundFormatString);\n        for (int i = 0; i < r.length; i++) {\n            double element = Double.valueOf(roundFormat.format(r[i]));\n            if (!counter.containsKey(element))\n                counter.put(element, new BigDecimal(0));\n            counter.put(element, counter.get(element).add(new BigDecimal(1)));\n        }\n        for (Double key : counter.keySet()) {\n            if (counter.get(key).compareTo(new BigDecimal(frequency)) > 0) {\n                mode = key;\n                frequency = counter.get(key).intValue();\n                log.debug(\"key: \" + key + \" Count: \" + counter.get(key));\n            }\n        }\n        iterations--;\n    }\n    return mode;\n}\n\\end{code}\n\nComment: I think you misunderstood the question.
