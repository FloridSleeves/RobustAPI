I am able to find the minimum item, but I am having trouble removing it.  My code is below.  public Comparable removeMin() {    Iterator<T> it = iterator();    T min = it.next();    while (it.hasNext()) {        T next = it.next();        if (min.compareTo(next) > 0)            min = next;        it.remove();    }    System.out.println(min);    return min;}I have the print statement there just to verify that it is in fact getting the minimum item.  The code in main looks like this.public static void main(String[] args) {  Bag<String> sbag = new Bag<String>();    sbag.add(\"Noriko\");    sbag.add(\"Peter\");     sbag.add(\"Buddy\");    sbag.add(\"Mary\");    sbag.removeMin();  }When I run the sbag.removeMin(); command, the console prints \"Buddy\" which tells me that it is choosing \"Buddy\" as the min item.  However, if I instead populate sbag with integers, it always prints the smallest integer, which indicates to me I have my code correct in that regard.I have two questions.1). When passing a list of strings such as above, how does Java determine which is smallest?2). How can I fix my code so that it not only finds the minimum item, but also removes it?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "1) When passing a list of strings such as above, how does Java determine which is smallest?\nJava uses the compareTo() method to determine which is smallest.\n2) How can I fix my code so that it not only finds the minimum item, but also removes it?\nYou can use the remove() method to remove the minimum item.\nQuestion: How to remove minimum item from data array in Java?: :I am working on a homework assignment in which I need to write a method that takes a data array and removes the minimum item from it.
