{"api": "Iterator.next", "prompt": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Generifying with \"super\": :I would like to write an Interator like this:class Plant { }class Tree extends Plant { }class Maple extends Tree { }// Iterator class: compiler error on the word \"super\".class MyIterator<T super Maple> implements Iterator<T> {    private int index = 0;    private List<Maple> list = // Get the list from an external source.    public T next() {         Maple maple = list.get(index++);         // Do some processing.         return maple;    }    // The other methods of Iterator are easy to implement.}Conceptually, the idea is to have an iterator that looks like it returns Trees or Plants (even though they are always Maples) without writing separate classes for each.But the compiler doesn't like it when I generify with T super Maple; apparently you can only generify a class using T extends Something. Does anyone know of a good way to accomplish the same thing?My motivation for asking is that I have a program that uses interfaces for its API. I want to have one method that returns an iterator of interfaces (for the API) and another that returns an iterator of the implementation classes (for internal use).\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: class MyIterator<T> implements Iterator<T> {\n    private int index = 0;\n    private List<T> list = // Get the list from an external source.\n    public T next() {\n        T t = list.get(index++);\n        // Do some processing.\n        return t;\n    }\n    // The other methods of Iterator are easy to implement.\n}\nConceptually, the idea is to have an iterator that looks like it returns Trees or Plants (even though they are always Maples) without writing separate classes for each.\nBut the compiler doesn't like it when I generify with T super Maple; apparently you can only generify a class using T extends Something.\nDoes anyone know of a good way to accomplish the same thing?\nMy motivation for asking is that I have a program that uses interfaces for its API.
