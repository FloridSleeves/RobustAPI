It consists of trying to write in the file for the last time. There are two threads: A - which is creating a file and checking if the right line is in the file and B - which is searching for a file and trying to rewrite the file with a \u201cgood\u201d line. The \u201cwinner\u201d thread must have string in a file. To do it thread checks if file has their line, file has only one line. The threads have only file path.public class A implements Runnable {private File file;private Thread t;public A(String patch,String fileName){    t = new Thread(this);    CreateFile(patch, fileName);    //t.setDaemon(true);    t.start();}@Overridepublic void run() {    BufferedReader reader;    while (!Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) {        try {            reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream(file)));            if (reader.readLine().charAt(0) == 'B') {                System.out.println(\"A try took file: \" + file.getName());                write();            } else {                System.out.println(\"A took file: \" + file.getName());            }        } catch (FileNotFoundException e)        {            System.out.println(\"File read A\" + e.toString());        }        catch (IOException e)        {            System.out.println(\"File read A\"+e.toString());        }    }}private void write() {    try {        PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(file);        printWriter.println(\"A took file: \" + file.getName());        System.out.println(\"A took file: \" + file.getName());        printWriter.close();    } catch (Exception e) {        System.out.println(\"File write A\");    }}public File CreateFile(String patch,String fileName) {    File file = new File(patch,fileName+\".txt\");    try {        PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(file);        printWriter.println(\"A took file: \" + file.getName());        System.out.println(\"A took file: \" + file.getName());        printWriter.close();    } catch (Exception e) {        System.out.println(\"File create A\");    }    return file;}}public class B implements Runnable {private File file;private Thread t;public B(String patch,String fileName){    t = new Thread(this);    //t.setDaemon(true);    FindFile(patch, fileName);    t.start();}@Overridepublic void run() {    BufferedReader reader;    while (!Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) {        try {            reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream(file)));            if (reader.readLine().charAt(0) == 'A') {                System.out.println(\"B try took file: \" + file.getName());                write();            } else {                System.out.println(\"B took file: \" + file.getName());            }        } catch (FileNotFoundException e)        {            System.out.println(\"File read B\" + e.toString());        }        catch (IOException e)        {            System.out.println(\"File read B\"+e.toString());        }    }}private void write() {    try {        PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(file);        printWriter.println(\"B took file: \" + file.getName());        System.out.println(\"B took file: \" + file.getName());        printWriter.close();    } catch (Exception e) {        System.out.println(\"File write B\");    }}public File FindFile(String patch,String fileName) {    File file= null;    File folder = new File(patch);    File[] listOfFiles = folder.listFiles();    BufferedReader reader;    for (int i = 0; i < listOfFiles.length; i++) {        file = listOfFiles[i];        if (file.getName().equals(fileName + \".txt\")) {            break;        }    }    return file;}}I want to synchronize in some way access to the file in threads. In my code I have java.lang.NullPointerException when I use readLine(), so I think this is because threads don\u2019t have synchronized access to the file (after every finished operation file must have one line). I can\u2019t use synchronized method or block, because threads don\u2019t have joint variable of the file.
