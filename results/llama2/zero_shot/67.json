So i'm thinking this is probably what they have done (the data was encrypted by a PHP application)I'm trying to decrypt this text with javax.crypto.Cipher but i think i problably need more information on the specific encryption, but i dont really know what information to ask for, and think its likely the 'default options' will probably work.
