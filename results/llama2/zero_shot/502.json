But for some reason this keeps lagging out my game and running it out of memory. Why is this happening and how do I fix this?I create the list like this:List<Snake> snake = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<Snake>();This is where I create new objects and remove them in a forloop:public void snake() {    snake.add(new Snake(ball.getX(), ball.getY()));    currentTime++;    for(Snake currentSnake: snake) {        if(currentSnake.creationDate < SnakeLength){            currentSnake.Update();        } else {            Gdx.app.log(\"SnakeLength\" + SnakeLength, \"CreationDate\" + currentSnake.creationDate);            snake.remove(currentSnake);        }    }}This is how my snake class looks like:public class Snake{    float width = Gdx.graphics.getWidth();    float height = Gdx.graphics.getHeight();    float screenwidth = width/270;    float screenheight = height/480;    public float x;    public float y;    public int creationDate;    ShapeRenderer shapeRenderer;    SpriteBatch batch;    public boolean active = false;    public Snake(float x, float y) {        shapeRenderer = new ShapeRenderer();        batch = new SpriteBatch();        this.x = x;        this.y = y;    }    public void Update() {        batch.begin();        shapeRenderer.begin(ShapeType.Filled);        shapeRenderer.setColor(new Color(1, 1, 1, 0.2f));        shapeRenderer.circle(x + 8*screenwidth, y + 8*screenheight, 6*screenheight);        shapeRenderer.end();        batch.end();        creationDate++;    }}\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "You are creating a new list every time you call snake().
