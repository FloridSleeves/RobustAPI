(I don't know if this makes a difference since as I mentioned in the other question my arrays are small -50 elements-). If this does not make a difference point it out though.I am not interested in the value per se, only the indices.My question is whether there is a faster approach to go with it?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: Iterator.next()\n<<<explanation>>>: Iterator.next() returns the next element in the iterator.\nQuestion: How to get the next element in an iterator: :I have a list of elements and I want to get the next element in the list.
