Thanks in advance.EDITMy goal is not to have more than N number of entries in that table at any point of time. One solution I have is to use a Set and schedule a job to remove the older entries. But I find it dirty. I am looking for a cleaner solution.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "Iterator.next() returns the next element in the collection.
