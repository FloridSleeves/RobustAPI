I would like everything matched by ** to be passed to the method either:1. as a string (theRestOfPath = \"/else/and/some/more\"),2. or as an array (theRestOfPathArr = [\"else\",\"and\",\"some\",\"more\"]).  The number of path variables can vary, so I can't do:@RequestMapping(value=\"/something/{a}/{b}/{c}\", method=RequestMethod.GET)public String handleRequest(String a, String b, String c){ /***/ }Is there a way to do that?Thanks :)  ---EDIT---The solution I ended up with:  @RequestMapping(value = \"/something/**\", method = RequestMethod.GET)@ResponseBodypublic TextStory getSomething(HttpServletRequest request) {    final String URI_PATTERN = \"^.*/something(/.+?)(\\\\.json|\\\\.xml)?$\";    String uri = request.getRequestURI().replaceAll(URI_PATTERN, \"$1\");    return doSomethingWithStuff(uri);}\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:", "response": "I'm not sure if I understand your question correctly, but I think you can use the @PathVariable annotation to do what you want.\n\nFor example, if you have a method like this:\n\npublic String handleRequest(String theRestOfPath){\n\n}\n\nYou can annotate it with @PathVariable and specify the name of the variable you want to use. For example, if you want to use the variable \"theRestOfPath\", you can annotate the method with @PathVariable(\"theRestOfPath\").\n\nHere is an example of how you would use it:\n\n@PathVariable(\"theRestOfPath\")\npublic String handleRequest(String theRestOfPath){\n\n}\n\nThis will allow you to pass in the variable \"theRestOfPath\" to the method.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nAnswer: You can use the @PathVariable annotation to map a path variable to a method parameter.\n\nFor example, if you have a method like this:\n\n\\begin{code}\n@RequestMapping(value = \"/something/**\", method = RequestMethod.GET)\npublic String handleRequest(@PathVariable(\"theRestOfPath\") String theRestOfPath){\n    // do something with theRestOfPath\n}\n\\end{code}\n\nThis will allow you to pass in the variable \"theRestOfPath\" to the method.\n\nAnswer: You can use the @PathVariable annotation to map a path variable to a method parameter.\n\nFor example, if you have a method like this:\n\n\\begin{code}\n@RequestMapping(value = \"/something/**\", method = RequestMethod.GET)\npublic String handleRequest(@PathVariable(\"theRestOfPath\") String theRestOfPath){\n    // do something with theRestOfPath\n}\n\\end{code}\n\nThis will allow you to pass in the variable \"theRestOfPath\" to the method.\n\nAnswer: You can use the @PathVariable annotation to map a path variable to a method parameter.\n\nFor example, if you have a method like this:\n\n\\begin{code}\n@RequestMapping(value = \"/something/**\", method = RequestMethod.GET)\npublic String handleRequest(@PathVariable(\"theRestOfPath\") String theRestOfPath){\n    // do something with theRestOfPath\n}\n\\end{code}\n\nThis will allow you to pass in the variable \"theRestOfPath\" to the method."}
