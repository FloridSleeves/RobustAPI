Now, I need to split each of them using String.split(). I have a method that would correctly do the split operation, but I need to create a method that will store each element of my array in a string to pass it through to that method. The fact that each element of the array is being stored from an external txt file makes it even trickier. Any suggestions as to how to do this?

The fact that each element of the array is being stored from an external txt file makes it even trickier. Any suggestions as to how to do this?\nI'm not sure what you mean by \"correctly do the split operation\". If you're trying to split a string into an array of strings, you can use the split() method of the String class.\nAs for storing each element of the array in a string to pass it through to the method, you can use the Arrays.toString() method to convert the array into a String.\nQuestion: Here is all of my code:\n//store each line into an array\n//method takes each expression from infix.txt and stores them in a string array\n//@param none\n//@return none\nString[] list = new String[10];\n//and the method that would perform the split\n//parseArray(String entries)\n//parseArray(String entries)\nString delims = \"[ ]+\";\nString[] tokens = entries.split(delims);\nQuestion: here is the txt file:\n8 + 4 * 2 - 67 * 2 - 4 * 3 + 2 * 5\n2 * 3 * 4 - 8 + 9 / 3 / 35\n+ 7 * 4 - 64 * ( 3 + 2 * 4 ) - 7( 5 + 7 ) / ( 9 - 5 )\n3 * ( 5 * ( 5 - 2 ) ) - 9( ( 5 * ( 4 + 2 ) - ( 8 + 8 ) / 2 ) - 9 )\n^ 3( ( 5 + 5 * ( 6 - 2 ) + 4 ^ 2 ) * 8 )\n( ( ( 3 ^ 4 ) ) )\nQuestion: Please using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nI'm not sure what you're trying to do, but I'll give it a shot.
