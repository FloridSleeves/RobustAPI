So lets say we have a layout as such..<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <LinearLayout xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\" android:orientation=\"vertical\" android:layout_width=\"fill_parent\" android:layout_height=\"fill_parent\"><LinearLayout xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\" android:orientation=\"vertical\" android:layout_width=\"fill_parent\" android:layout_height=\"fill_parent\" android:background=\"@drawable/app_background\" android:padding=\"5dip\" ><ListView android:id=\"@+id/xlist\"            android:layout_width=\"fill_parent\"            android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"            android:cacheColorHint=\"#00000000\"            android:divider=\"@drawable/listdivider\"            android:dividerHeight=\"19dp\"           />  <TextView               android:layout_width=\"fill_parent\"              android:background=\"@drawable/listdivider\"              android:layout_height=\"19dp\"              android:visibility=\"gone\"             android:id=\"@+id/dividerline\"              />  <ListView android:id=\"@+id/ylist\"            android:layout_width=\"fill_parent\"            android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"            android:cacheColorHint=\"#00000000\"             android:divider=\"@drawable/listdivider\"            android:dividerHeight=\"19dp\"           /></LinearLayout></LinearLayout>So you set two Variables as listviews, and based on the xml the \"xlist\" will appear before the \"ylist\".  But for my code I would like to switch the ordering of this view if a certain condition is met.  So how would I go about switching the order so that if a certain condition is met, the \"ylist\" will appear above the \"xlist\"?\nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer:", "response": "You can use the following code to change the order of the views:\n\n\\begin{code}\nLinearLayout layout = (LinearLayout) findViewById(R.id.layout);\nViewGroup.LayoutParams params = layout.getLayoutParams();\nparams.addRule(RelativeLayout.BELOW, R.id.xlist);\nlayout.setLayoutParams(params);\n\\end{code}\n\nComment: I'm not sure if I understand your question correctly.
