required in a application which has  options of \"Save\" and \"search\" according to the id but id is in combined form of String and Integer (eg abc/345) and the next id is incremented version of last id ie abc/346,abc/347 So I create two columns to store id in database , first for string part and second for integer partproblem is that When I enter full id ie abc/345 in textfield and click on the \"Search button\" then the other fields should be fill according to this full id\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:", "response": "Java, Swing, sql- Can I match a value
