Currently I simply iterate thru the list looking and establish comms with a host to check its not busy. If not I will send a job to it. This approach tends to mean that the first host in the list tends to get hot constanly with the load not balanced properly with the rest of the available hosts.in pseudocode ..for (Host h : hosts) {    //checkstatus    if status == job accepted break;}I'd like to balance this load properly between the hosts i.e first time host one is used 2nd time the method is used host 2. Just wondering that the most elegant solution to this is ??ThanksW\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "Iterator.next()\nExplanation: Iterator.next() returns the next element in the iterator.\nQuestion: round robin scheduling java iterators: :I have a list of hosts in an array which represnt the servers available to do a particular job.

This is the most elegant solution to this problem. The iterator is a sequence of elements. The next() method returns the next element in the sequence.\nQuestion: round robin scheduling java iterators: :I have a list of hosts in an array which represnt the servers available to do a particular job.
