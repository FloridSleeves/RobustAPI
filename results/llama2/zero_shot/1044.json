Though the numbers are written in a text format. I want to accomplish this myself though i have stumbled upon a few difficulties that i would like some advice on.An example of the question is that one child has thirteen balloons and is selling them for three hundred cents. Obviously I have to set up the variables so the string numbers are converted into an integers e.g.int one = 1, two = 2, three = 3, twelve = 12, thirty = 30, hundred = 100;My initial attempt is to create a loop where I have assigned a count to stop when all the numbers have been accumulated, though the loop keeps on adding the the first number.My question is, when I input the text using the scanner object, what loop is required to add the first (written) number and then move onto the second (written) number, which will be added to the sum variable?Thanks for your time and I hope that this question is easy to understand.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken(String str)\n<<<explanation>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken(String str) returns the next token in the string str.\nQuestion: I am attempting a question from the Java tutorial where I have to create a program that output the sum of numbers from a sentence.
