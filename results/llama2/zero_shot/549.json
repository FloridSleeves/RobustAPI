I went through this way: Preferences -> Java -> Compiler -> Errors / Warnings -> Deprecated and Restricted API. Then i changed errors to warnings. But now i can not use that library efficient, cause eclipse suggest me nothing about that library.My first question is; if there is a better way to do that? Or maybe another way to use this library efficient in eclipse?EDIT: I found out it was a complication of 32 and 64 bit versions. After installing 32bit JDK and reference the jai_imageio.jar it worked fine.And second; Can anybody give a plain example to me about converting .bmp image to jpeg2000 image. That would help a lot to me about undesrtanding the context.Thank you\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "I have seen some examples here and installed Java Advanced Imaging Image I/O Tools on my computer, because obviously it is a requirement of processing JPEG2000 images.After install this i am able to import librariese.g. import com.sun.media.imageio.plugins.*;after importing, i should be able to use constructors or methods of that library but i am getting this error: \"Access restriction: The type 'J2KImageWriteParam' is not API (restriction on required library 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Java\\jre1.8.0_77\\lib\\ext\\jai_imageio.jar')\" After a litle bit research, i found out that i can change eclipse preferences and ignore that error.
