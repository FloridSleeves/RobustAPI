Time constraints are not relevant to my problem because the lists will likely contain few elements.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: Iterator.next()\n<<<explanation>>>: Iterator.next() returns the next element in the iterator.\nQuestion: How to get a list of all lists containing exactly one element of each list of a list of lists: :As you may have understood with the title, I need some smart thinking here :)I have a List<List<Object>> object.
