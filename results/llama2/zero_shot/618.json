When I try to retrieve it using BackendlessUser.getProperty(\"key\"), it returns zero objects. Once it even returned HashMap. I used the way mentioned in the  the docs, but get null because the size of the Object[] is zero. I have data in that row for sure, wrote <uses-permission> for internet.public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {    BackendlessUser user = null;    @Override    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);        Backendless.initApp(this, \"app_id\", \"android_key\", \"v1\");        Backendless.UserService.login(\"username\", \"password\", new AsyncCallback<BackendlessUser>() {            @Override            public void handleResponse(BackendlessUser response) {                user = response;                doStuff();            }            @Override            public void handleFault(BackendlessFault fault) {                Log.e(\"Error logging in\", \"message: \" + fault.getMessage());            }        });    }    //important    private void doStuff() {        Object[] postObjectArray = (Object[]) user.getProperty(\"posts\");        Post[] posts = null;        if (postObjectArray != null && postObjectArray.length > 0)            posts = (Post[])postObjectArray;        if (posts == null)        {            Log.d(\"Problems\", \"posts is null\");        }    }}Post class:public class Post extends Object{    private BackendlessUser user;    private String file;    private String message;    private String objectId;    public String getObjectId() {        return objectId;    }    public void setObjectId(String objectId) {        this.objectId = objectId;    }    public Post() {    }    public Post(BackendlessUser user, String file, String message) {        this.user = user;        this.file = file;        this.message = message;    }    public BackendlessUser getUser() {        return user;    }    public void setUser(BackendlessUser user) {        this.user = user;    }    public String getFile() {        return file;    }    public void setFile(String file) {        this.file = file;    }    public String getMessage() {        return message;    }    public void setMessage(String message) {        this.message = message;    }}\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:", "response": "The problem is that you are trying to get the property of the user object, but the user object does not have a property called \"posts\".
