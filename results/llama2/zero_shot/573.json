You can use the following code to get the most common color:\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\nBufferedImage image = ImageIO.read(new File(\"image.jpg\"));\nColor[] colors = image.getRGB(0, 0, image.getWidth(), image.getHeight(), null, 0, image.getWidth());\nint mostCommonColor = 0;\nfor (int i = 0; i < colors.length; i++) {\nif (colors[i].getRGB() > mostCommonColor) {\nmostCommonColor = colors[i].getRGB();\nSystem.out.println(\"The most common color is \" + mostCommonColor);\nQuestion: Getting the most common color of an image: :I'd like to get the most common color from an image.
