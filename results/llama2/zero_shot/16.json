I have an action bar button that injects a fragment into the main activity. The code works fine when it is inside the onOptionsItemSelected block, like so:@Overridepublic boolean onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem item) {    Intent intent;    switch (item.getItemId()) {        case R.id.action_chat:            Log.v(\"Click\", \"Chat button\");            RelativeLayout mainLayout = (RelativeLayout) findViewById(R.id.main_layout);            LinearLayout ll = new LinearLayout(this);            ll.setId(999);            getFragmentManager().beginTransaction().add(ll.getId(), ChatFragment.newInstance()).commit();            mainLayout.addView(ll);            break;        case R.id.action_settings:            intent = new Intent(this, SettingsActivity.class);            startActivity(intent);            break;    }    return super.onOptionsItemSelected(item);}But I'm trying to have an external class handle the fragment insertion (since this is something that needs to be available to other activities as well). So I call it like this:         case R.id.action_chat:            ChatHandler chatHandler = new ChatHandler();            chatHandler.goChat(View view);            break;And on the ChatHandler class:public class ChatHandler {        public void goChat(View view) {            Log.v(\"GoChat\", \"Start\");            RelativeLayout mainLayout = (RelativeLayout) view.findViewById(R.id.main_layout);            LinearLayout ll = new LinearLayout(this);            ll.setId(999);            getFragmentManager().beginTransaction().add(ll.getId(), ChatFragment.newInstance()).commit();            mainLayout.addView(ll);        }    }My question is what parameters do I need to pass in the main activity goChat(View? view?) and how do I reference the main activity from the ChatHandler class, as in the this at LinearLayout ll = new LinearLayout(this);Thanks!\nPlease using this api: Activity.findViewById.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please using this api: Activity.findViewById.\n\nAnswer: You can use the following code:\n\n\\begin{code}\n@Override\npublic boolean onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem item) {\n    switch (item.getItemId()) {\n        case R.id.action_chat:\n            ChatHandler chatHandler = new ChatHandler();\n            chatHandler.goChat(View view);\n            break;\n        case R.id.action_settings:\n            Intent intent = new Intent(this, SettingsActivity.class);\n            startActivity(intent);\n            break;\n    }\n    return super.onOptionsItemSelected(item);\n}\n\\end{code}\n\nComment: Thanks for the response.
