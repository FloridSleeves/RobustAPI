I.e if i dont support dont transmit...c). i could have annotaded injection i.e@Twitter, @Facebook all in a controller bean and then select the appropriate but my service implementations number will grow....Thanks in advance,Dimitri\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "I would use the @Inject annotation.\nQuestion: I have a class that has a method that takes a String and returns a String.
