This method allows you to write a byte array to the output stream.\nHere is an example of how you could use it:\nDataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());\ndos.write(yourByteArray);\nThis will write the byte array to the output stream, and the client will receive it.\nPlease let me know if this helps or if you need more information.\nQuestion: TCP Server-Client large json: :I currently have a TCP server (java desktop application) and client (android application) connected.I can send json string from client to server and from server to client, my issue is sometimes i need to send from the server a large string which gets cut.This is my code:SERVER SIDE public void sendResponse(String response){  PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(BufferedWriter(                       new OutputStreamWriter(mClientSocket.getOutputStream())), true);  if(writer != null && !writer.checkError()){     writer.println(response);     writer.flush();  }}CLIENT SIDEBufferedReader input = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(mSocket.getInputStream()));String response;while((response = input.readLine()) != null && mRun){    Data data = new Gson().fromJson(response, Data.class);    //when i try to convert the response to Data object using Gson    //it gives me a com.google.gson.JsonSyntaxException: com.google.gson.stream.MalformedJsonException: Unterminated array at line 1 column 106498as you can see the error on client side happens because the string was to large so it got cut off, can someone please tell me what to do in this case?thanks in advance.\nPlease use the write method of the DataOutputStream class to write the large string to the output stream.\nQuestion: TCP Server-Client large json: :I currently have a TCP server (java desktop application) and client (android application) connected.I can send json string from client to server and from server to client, my issue is sometimes i need to send from the server a large string which gets cut.This is my code:SERVER SIDE public void sendResponse(String response){  PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(BufferedWriter(                       new OutputStreamWriter(mClientSocket.getOutputStream())), true);  if(writer != null && !writer.checkError()){     writer.println(response);     writer.flush();  }}CLIENT SIDEBufferedReader input = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(mSocket.getInputStream()));String response;while((response = input.readLine()) != null && mRun){    Data data = new Gson().fromJson(response, Data.class);    //when i try to convert the response to Data object using Gson    //it gives me a com.google.gson.JsonSyntaxException: com.google.gson.stream.MalformedJsonException: Unterminated array at line 1 column 106498as you can see the error on client side happens because the string was to large so it got cut off, can someone please tell me what to do in this case?thanks in advance.\nPlease use the write method of the DataOutputStream class to write the large string to the output stream. You can use the write method to write the string to the output stream in chunks, so that it doesn't get cut off.\nQuestion: TCP Server-Client large json: :I currently have a TCP server (java desktop application) and client (android application) connected.I can send json string from client to server and from server to client, my issue is sometimes i need to send from the server a large string which gets cut.This is my code:SERVER SIDE public void sendResponse(String response){  PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(BufferedWriter(                       new OutputStreamWriter(mClientSocket.getOutputStream())), true);  if(writer != null && !writer.checkError()){     writer.println(response);     writer.flush();  }}CLIENT SIDEBufferedReader input = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(mSocket.getInputStream()));String response;while((response = input.readLine()) != null && mRun){    Data data = new Gson().fromJson(response, Data.class);    //when i try to convert the response to Data object using Gson    //it gives me a com.google.gson"}
