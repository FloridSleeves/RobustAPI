although BIOS are different (AMI vs Dell), settings seem pretty similar.I'll update the Dell's BIOS soon and retest, but I would appreciate any insight...thanks\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "I'm not sure if this question should be here or in serverfault, but it's java-related so here it is:\nI have two servers, with very similar technology:\nserver1 is Oracle/Sun x86 with dual x5670 CPU (2.93 GHz) (4 cores each), 12GB RAM.\nserver2 is Dell R610 with dual x5680 CPU (3.3 GHz) (6 cores each), 16GB RAM.\nboth are running Solaris x86, with exact same configuration.\nboth have turbo-boost enabled, and no hyper-threading.\nserver2 should therefore be SLIGHTLY faster than server1.\nI'm running the following short test program on the two platforms.\nimport java.io.*;\npublic class TestProgram {\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\nnew TestProgram ();\npublic TestProgram () {\ntry {        PrintWriter writer  = new PrintWriter(new FileOutputStream(\"perfs.txt\", true), true);\nfor (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {\nlong t1 = System.nanoTime();\nSystem.out.println(\"0123456789qwertyuiop0123456789qwertyuiop0123456789qwertyuiop0123456789qwertyuiop\");\nlong t2 = System.nanoTime();\nwriter.println((t2-t1));\n//try {\n//  Thread.sleep(1);\n//}\n//catch(Exception e) {\n//  System.out.println(\"thread sleep exception\");\nI'm opening perfs.txt and averaging the results, I get:\nserver1: average = 1664 , trim 10% = 1615\nserver2: average = 1510 , trim 10% = 1429\nwhich is a somewhat expected result (server2 perfs > server1 perfs).\nnow, I uncomment the \"Thread.sleep(1)\" part and test again, the results are now:\nserver1: average = 27598 , trim 10% = 26583\nserver2: average = 52320 , trim 10% = 39359\nthis time server2 perfs < server1 perf\nthat doesn't make any sense to me...\nobviously I'm looking at a way to improve server2 perfs in the second case. there must be some kind of configuration that is different, and I don't know which one.\nOS are identical, java version are identical.\ncould it be linked to the number of cores ?\nmaybe it's a BIOS setting ?
