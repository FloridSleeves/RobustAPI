Now, I want to store/upload those arrays to/from memory and disk. Currently, I am using Java NIO's FileChannel and MappedByteBuffer to solve this. It works fine, but it takes near about 5 seconds (Wall Clock Time) for storing/uploading array to/from memory to disk. Now, I want to make it faster. Here, I should mention most of those array elements are 0 ( nearly 52 %).like:int arr1 [] = { 0 , 0 , 6 , 7 , 1, 0 , 0 ...}Can anybody help me, is there any nice way to improve speed by not storing or loading those 0's. This can compensated by using Arrays.fill (array , 0).\nPlease using this api: FileChannel.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "compressed Array to increase IO performance:\nFileChannel.write(mappedByteBuffer, FileChannel.MapMode.READ_WRITE, 0, 220000000);\nQuestion: Write \"compressed\" Array to increase IO performance?: :I have an int and float array each of length 220 million (fixed).
