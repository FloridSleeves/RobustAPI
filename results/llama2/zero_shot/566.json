So I wondered if ImageIO could detect the end of an image. (I have absolutely no knowledge of the JPEG format, so I tested it instead)Apparently, not.On the server side, I sent images continuously by using ImageIO.write(...) in loop with some sleeping in between. On the client side, ImageIO read the first image no problem, but on the next one it returned null. This is confusing. I was expecting it to either block on reading the first image (because it thinks the next image is still part of the same image), or succeed at reading all of them (because it works). What is going on? It looks like ImageIO detects the end of the first image, but not the second one. (The images, by the way, are similar to each other roughly) Is there an easy way to stream images like this or do I have to make my own mechanism that reads the bytes into a buffer until it reaches a specified byte or sequence of bytes, at which point it reads the image out of the buffer?This is the useful part of my server code:        while(true){            Socket sock=s.accept();            System.out.println(\"Connection\");            OutputStream out=sock.getOutputStream();            while(!socket.isClosed()){                BufferedImage img=//get image                ImageIO.write(img, \"jpg\", out);                Thread.sleep(100);            }            System.out.println(\"Closed\");        }And my client code:        Socket s=new Socket(InetAddress.getByName(\"localhost\"), 1998);        InputStream in=s.getInputStream();        while(!s.isClosed()){            BufferedImage img=ImageIO.read(in);            if(img==null)//this is what happens on the SECOND image            else // do something useful with the image        }\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "I'm not sure what you're trying to do, but I'll give it a shot.\nYou can use the ImageIO.read() method to read an image from a stream. You can also use the ImageIO.write() method to write an image to a stream.\nThe ImageIO.read() method returns null if the image cannot be read. This can happen if the image is not in the correct format, or if the image is too large to be read in the time allotted.\nThe ImageIO.write() method returns null if the image cannot be written. This can happen if the image is too large to be written in the time allotted, or if the image is not in the correct format.\nSo, if you're trying to read an image from a stream, and the read() method returns null, then the image is not in the correct format, or the image is too large to be read in the time allotted.\nIf you're trying to write an image to a stream, and the write() method returns null, then the image is not in the correct format, or the image is too large to be written in the time allotted.\nSo, if you're trying to read an image from a stream, and the read() method returns null, then the image is not in the correct format, or the image is too large to be read in the time allotted.
