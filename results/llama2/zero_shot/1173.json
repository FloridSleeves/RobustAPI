I'm trying to have a multi threaded environment that stays active so that I can just submit tasks and run them. I want to do this without the hassle of executing in a web server or application server. The idea was to use a java thread pool for this, but the issue here is that the pool stays open just until my main method finishes, after which obviously it closes and the program finishes. How can I prevent this from happening? I'm sure there are several options, some more naive than others (while true loops come to mind). Any ideas? Thanks. \nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:", "response": "java thread pool keep running: :The problem is that you are not closing the thread pool.
