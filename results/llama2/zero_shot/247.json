Now I am programming in Java (for Android, and I'm new in Java), and I have to access the data which were previously written to a file using C#. I tried using DataInputStream.readInt() and DataInputStream.readUTF(), but I can't get proper results. I usually get a UTFDataFormatException: java.io.UTFDataFormatException: malformed input around byte 21or the String and int I get is wrong...FileInputStream fs = new FileInputStream(strFilePath);DataInputStream ds = new DataInputStream(fs);int i;String str1,str2,str3;i=ds.readInt();str1=ds.readUTF();str2=ds.readUTF();str3=ds.readUTF();ds.close();What is the proper way of doing this?   \nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<explanation>>>: InputStream.read\nQuestion: How to get the value of a variable in a function: :I have a function that takes a variable as an argument.
