Closed 10 years ago.At first there was an issue removing an element in an arraylist if it was the only one on the list but now there is an exception issue when deleting the last position of the arraylist. What is the best way to deal with this? edit: Looking back, checking if it is the last element and putting in a dummy element to hold the only spot would work.the code:  public void deleteCustomer(){            String id = null;            boolean c = false; //true if id is found            int remember = 0;      //Remembers the deleted index            id = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(null,\"input the if of whome you want to delete\",                    \"input id\", JOptionPane.PLAIN_MESSAGE);            int id2 = Integer.parseInt(id); //new int id.            for(int i = 0; i < customers.size(); i++){                if(id2 == customers.get(i).getID()){                    if(customers.size() == 1){                        System.out.println(\"test one person\");                        customers.get(i).setDate(null);                        customers.get(i).setID(0);                        customers.get(i).setName(null);                        customers.get(i).setPeople(0);                    }                    else{                        customers.remove(i);                    }                    c = true;                    remember = i;                if(c == true)                break;            }            }            if(c == true){                int i1 = JOptionPane.showConfirmDialog(null,\"the customer \"                       + customers.get(remember).getName() + \" has been deleted.\",                            \"input people\", JOptionPane.PLAIN_MESSAGE);            }            else{                int i1 = JOptionPane.showConfirmDialog(null,\"the customer could not be found,\" +                        \" please check your id\",                                \"input people\", JOptionPane.PLAIN_MESSAGE);            }        }the errorException in thread \"AWT-EventQueue-0\" java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: Index: 1, Size: 1    at java.util.ArrayList.rangeCheck(Unknown Source)    at java.util.ArrayList.get(Unknown Source)    at MainFrame.deleteCustomer(MainFrame.java:360)    at MainFrame$4.actionPerformed(MainFrame.java:170)    at javax.swing.AbstractButton.fireActionPerformed(Unknown Source)    at javax.swing.AbstractButton$Handler.actionPerformed(Unknown Source)    at javax.swing.DefaultButtonModel.fireActionPerformed(Unknown Source)    at javax.swing.DefaultButtonModel.setPressed(Unknown Source)    at javax.swing.plaf.basic.BasicButtonListener.mouseReleased(Unknown Source)    at java.awt.Component.processMouseEvent(Unknown Source)    at javax.swing.JComponent.processMouseEvent(Unknown Source)    at java.awt.Component.processEvent(Unknown Source)    at java.awt.Container.processEvent(Unknown Source)    at java.awt.Component.dispatchEventImpl(Unknown Source)    at java.awt.Container.dispatchEventImpl(Unknown Source)    at java.awt.Component.dispatchEvent(Unknown Source)    at java.awt.LightweightDispatcher.retargetMouseEvent(Unknown Source)    at java.awt.LightweightDispatcher.processMouseEvent(Unknown Source)    at java.awt.LightweightDispatcher.dispatchEvent(Unknown Source)    at java.awt.Container.dispatchEventImpl(Unknown Source)    at java.awt.Window.dispatchEventImpl(Unknown Source)    at java.awt.Component.dispatchEvent(Unknown Source)    at java.awt.EventQueue.dispatchEventImpl(Unknown Source)    at java.awt.EventQueue.access$200(Unknown Source)    at java.awt.EventQueue$3.run(Unknown Source)    at java.awt.EventQueue$3.run(Unknown Source)    at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method)    at java.security.ProtectionDomain$1.doIntersectionPrivilege(Unknown Source)    at java.security.ProtectionDomain$1.doIntersectionPrivilege(Unknown Source)    at java.awt.EventQueue$4.run(Unknown Source)    at java.awt.EventQueue$4.run(Unknown Source)    at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method)    at java.security.ProtectionDomain$1.doIntersectionPrivilege(Unknown Source)    at java.awt.EventQueue.dispatchEvent(Unknown Source)    at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpOneEventForFilters(Unknown Source)    at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEventsForFilter(Unknown Source)    at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEventsForHierarchy(Unknown Source)    at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEvents(Unknown Source)    at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEvents(Unknown Source)    at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.run(Unknown Source)\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "You can't remove the last element of an arraylist if it's the only element.\n\nYou can use a for loop to iterate through the arraylist and remove the element at the index of the last element.\n\n\\begin{code}\nfor (int i = 0; i < customers.size(); i++) {\n    if (i == customers.size() - 1) {\n        customers.remove(i);\n    }\n}\n\\end{code}\n\nComment: I'm not sure if I understand your question.
