However, FindBugs complains about this line:sortedEntries.addAll(map.entrySet());The complaint is:Bug: Adding elements of an entry set may fail due to reuse of  Map.Entry object in  com.local.sem.util.MapUtil.entriesSortedByValues(Map)The entrySet() method is allowed to return a view of the underlying  Map in which a single Entry object is reused and returned during the  iteration. As of Java 1.6, both IdentityHashMap and EnumMap did so.  When iterating through such a Map, the Entry value is only valid until  you advance to the next iteration. If, for example, you try to pass  such an entrySet to an addAll method, things will go badly wrong.
