Maybe I'm going about this the wrong way, but let's see where this question goes :)I would like a Map container that contains either Strings or lists of Strings. I want to enforce this rule during construction of this object so that you can't create a map with values that aren't either of those.e.g.class Record {  public Record(String key, Map<String,Object> attrs) {    // check that attrs only contains Objects which are Strings or List<Strings>  }}Other ways I have thought of to solve the problem might be...1)class Record {  public Record(String key, Map<String,String> attrs, Map<String,List<String>> multiAttrs) {    // ...  }}2)class Record {  public Record(String key, Map<String,Value> attrs) {    // ...  }}class Value {  // Create some funky class that encapsulates lists.  // Perhaps returning the only element in the list if the size is 1,  // but returning the list otherwise}I am not immediately excited at the alternatives, but I'm just putting it there as stuff I've already considered. Really I want the distinction between Strings and List to be transparent to the user of the class.\nPlease using this api: List.get.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: List.get\n<<<code>>>: List.get(0)\n<<<explanation>>>: Returns the first element of the list.\nQuestion: How can I get the first element of a list in Java?: :I'm trying to get the first element of a list in Java.
