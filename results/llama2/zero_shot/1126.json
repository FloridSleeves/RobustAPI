I have a matrix in txt file. This matrix looks:231 324 123345 565 234657 234 654I want to replacement elements to form:654 234 657234 565 345231 324 123I have a algorithm with replacement elements: 3-1-i, where i is number of choosen element from array. I have a problem how I read file and save elements to array and how implement this loop. This is my try with reading txt file and saving elements to array:    List<String[]> rows = new ArrayList<String[]>();    while ((line = bfr.readLine()) != null) {        String[] row = line.split(\" \");         rows.add(row);       }    System.out.println(rows.toString());  But I get [Ljava.lang.String;@525483cd as result.
