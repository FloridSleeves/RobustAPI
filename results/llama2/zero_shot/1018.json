Please using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nQuestion: I have a problem with my code. I have a method that takes a string and returns a string. The method is called \"getStringFromString\". The method is supposed to take a string and return a string that is the same as the string, but with the first letter capitalized. For example, if the string is \"hello\", the method should return \"Hello\". I have tried many different ways to do this, but I can't seem to get it to work. I have tried using the String.toUpperCase() method, but that doesn't work. I have also tried using the String.toLowerCase() method, but that doesn't work either. I have also tried using the String.replace() method, but that doesn't work either. I have also tried using the String.split() method, but that doesn't work either. I have also tried using the String.trim() method, but that doesn't work either. I have also tried using the String.length() method, but that doesn't work either. I have also tried using the String.charAt() method, but that doesn't work either. I have also tried using the String.substring() method, but that doesn't work either. I have also tried using the String.concat() method, but that doesn't work either. I have also tried using the String.replaceAll() method, but that doesn't work either. I have also tried using the String.replaceFirst() method, but that doesn't work either. I have also tried using the String.replaceAll(\"[a-z]\", \"[A-Z]\") method, but that doesn't work either. I have also tried using the String.replaceAll(\"[A-Z]\", \"[a-z]\") method, but that doesn't work either. I have also tried using the String.replaceAll(\"[a-z]\", \"[A-Z]\") method, but that doesn't work either. I have also tried using the String.replaceAll(\"[A-Z]\", \"[a-z]\") method, but that doesn't work either. I have also tried using the String.replaceAll(\"[a-z]\", \"[A-Z]\") method, but that doesn't work either. I have also tried using the String.replaceAll(\"[A-Z]\", \"[a-z]\") method, but that doesn't work either. I have also tried using the String.replaceAll(\"[a-z]\", \"[A-Z]\") method, but that doesn't work either.
