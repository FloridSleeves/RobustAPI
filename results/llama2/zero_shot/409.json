As per the requirement I need to iterate over the keySet of the Map and remove objects which dont need any modification.Conside the code below: public void remove(Map<String,User> removeUser){  Set<String> keySet = removeUser.keySey();  User user = null;  for(String key : keySet){      user = (user) removeUser.get(key);       if(!user.isActive()){                removeUser.remove(key);       }  } }Here in above code, I am getting ConcurrentModificationException when I try to fetch User object after Object removal.Can anyone tell me why it's happening?I have not used multi threading.So not able to understand, from where it generated ConCurrentModification Exception.Even I tried with HashMap and Hashtable, but the problem still exist.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "You are getting ConcurrentModificationException because you are modifying the map while iterating over it.\nYou can use the following code to remove the elements from the map.\n\n\\begin{code}\npublic void remove(Map<String,User> removeUser){\n    Set<String> keySet = removeUser.keySey();\n    for(String key : keySet){\n        User user = (User) removeUser.get(key);\n        if(!user.isActive()){\n            removeUser.remove(key);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\\end{code}\n\nComment: I have tried with this code, but still getting the same exception.\n\nComment: @user1234567890 I have updated the code.
