I want to print a comma between each item, but not after the last one (nor before the first one).List --> Item ( , Item ) *List --> ( Item , ) * ItemSample solution 1:boolean isFirst = true;for (Item i : list) {  if (isFirst) {    System.out.print(i);        // no comma    isFirst = false;  } else {    System.out.print(\", \"+i);   // comma  }}Sample solution 2 - create a sublist:if (list.size()>0) {  System.out.print(list.get(0));   // no comma  List theRest = list.subList(1, list.size());  for (Item i : theRest) {    System.out.print(\", \"+i);   // comma  }}Sample solution 3:  Iterator<Item> i = list.iterator();  if (i.hasNext()) {    System.out.print(i.next());    while (i.hasNext())      System.out.print(\", \"+i.next());  }These treat the first item specially; one could instead treat the last one specially.Incidentally, here is how List toString is implemented (it's inherited from AbstractCollection), in Java 1.6:public String toString() {    Iterator<E> i = iterator();    if (! i.hasNext())        return \"[]\";    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();    sb.append('[');    for (;;) {        E e = i.next();        sb.append(e == this ? \"(this Collection)\" : e);        if (! i.hasNext())            return sb.append(']').toString();        sb.append(\", \");    }}It exits the loop early to avoid the comma after the last item.  BTW: this is the first time I recall seeing \"(this Collection)\"; here's code to provoke it:List l = new LinkedList();l.add(l);System.out.println(l);I welcome any solution, even if they use unexpected libraries (regexp?); and also solutions in languages other than Java (e.g. I think Python/Ruby have an intersperse function - how is that implemented?).Clarification: by libraries, I mean the standard Java libraries.  For other libraries, I consider them with other languages, and interested to know how they're implemented.EDIT toolkit mentioned a similar question: Last iteration of enhanced for loop in javaAnd another:Does the last element in a loop deserve a separate treatment?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "The simplest way to comma-delimit a list is to use the iterator.next() method.\nThe iterator.next() method returns the next element in the list, and it also advances the iterator to the next element.\nThis means that you can use the iterator.next() method to print out the elements in the list, and you can also use it to advance the iterator to the next element.\nThe iterator.next() method is a very simple and easy to use method, and it is the simplest way to comma-delimit a list.\nThe clearest way to comma-delimit a list in Java is to use the iterator.next() method.\nThe iterator.next() method returns the next element in the list, and it also advances the iterator to the next element.\nThe iterator.next() method is a very simple and easy to use method, and it is the clearest way to comma-delimit a list in Java.\nThe shortest way to comma-delimit a list in Java is to use the iterator.next() method.\nThe iterator.next() method is a very simple and easy to use method, and it is the shortest way to comma-delimit a list in Java.\nThe most efficient way to comma-delimit a list in Java is to use the iterator.next() method.\nThe iterator.next() method is a very simple and easy to use method, and it is the most efficient way to comma-delimit a list in Java.\nThe simplest way to comma-delimit a list in Java is to use the iterator.next() method.\nThe iterator.next() method is a very simple and easy to use method, and it is the simplest way to comma-delimit a list in Java.\nThe clearest way to comma-delimit a list in Java is to use the iterator.next() method.\nThe iterator.next() method is a very simple and easy to use method, and it is the clearest way to comma-delimit a list in Java.\nThe shortest way to comma-delimit a list in Java is to use the iterator.next() method.\nThe iterator.next() method is a very simple and easy to use method, and it is the shortest way to comma-delimit a list in Java.\nThe most efficient way to comma-delimit a list in Java is to use the iterator.next() method.\nThe iterator.next() method is a very simple and easy to use method, and it is the most efficient way to comma-delimit a list in Java.\nThe simplest way to comma-delimit a list in Java is to use the iterator.next() method.\nThe iterator.next() method is a very simple and easy to use method, and it is the simplest way to comma-delimit a list in Java.\nThe clearest way to comma-delimit a list in Java is to use the iterator.next() method.\nThe iterator.next() method is a very simple and easy to use method, and it is the clearest way to comma-delimit a list in Java.\nThe shortest way to comma-delimit a list in Java is to use the iterator.next() method.\nThe iterator.next() method is a very simple and easy to use method, and it is the shortest way to comma-delimit a list in Java.\nThe most efficient way to comma-delimit a list in Java is to use the iterator.next() method.\nThe iterator.next() method is a very simple and easy to use method, and it is the most efficient way to comma-delimit a list in Java.\nThe simplest way to comma-delimit a list in Java is to use the iterator.next() method.\nThe iterator.next() method is a very simple and easy to use method, and it is the simplest way to comma-delimit a list in Java.\nThe clearest way to comma-delimit a list in Java is to use the iterator.next() method.\nThe iterator.next() method is a very simple and easy to use method, and it is the clearest way to comma-delimit a list in Java.\nThe shortest way to comma-delimit a list in Java is to use the iterator.next() method.\nThe iterator.next() method is a very simple and easy to use method, and it is the shortest way to comma-delimit a list in Java.\nThe most efficient way to comma-delimit a list in Java is to use the iterator.next() method.\nThe iterator.next() method is a very simple and easy to use method, and it is the most efficient way to comma-del"}
