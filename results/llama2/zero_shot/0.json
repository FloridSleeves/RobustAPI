I believe it has something to do the the Context but I haven't got a clue how to implement it within my helper class.Any help would be greatly appreciated.\nPlease using this api: Activity.findViewById.\nAnswer:", "response": "You are trying to call findViewById on a class that extends Activity.\nfindViewById is a method of Activity.\n\nYou need to call findViewById on the AlarmHelper class.\n\nAnswer: You are trying to call findViewById on a class that extends Activity.\nfindViewById is a method of Activity.\n\nYou need to call findViewById on the AlarmHelper class.\n\nAnswer: You are trying to call findViewById on a class that extends Activity.\nfindViewById is a method of Activity.\n\nYou need to call findViewById on the AlarmHelper class."}
