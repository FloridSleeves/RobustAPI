I'm using them to make every class of my objects to do \"drawing\", but it takes a lot of memory so I want to cut it in half, is there a way to do for each loop not for a full list?for(Tile tile: tiles){tile.draw();}I want to:for(Tile tile: (half of)tiles){    tile.draw();}is it possible or I just need to get lenght of tiles and when it reaches the number break the loop?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "You can use the iterator to get the next element in the list.\nIterator<T> iterator = list.iterator();\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\nT next = iterator.next();\n// do something with next\n}\n\nAnswer: You can use the `Iterator` class to iterate over a list.\n\n\\begin{code}\nIterator<Tile> tileIterator = tiles.iterator();\nwhile (tileIterator.hasNext()) {\n    Tile tile = tileIterator.next();\n    tile.draw();\n}\n\\end{code}\n\nAnswer: You can use the `Iterator` class to iterate over a list.\n\n\\begin{code}\nIterator<Tile> tileIterator = tiles.iterator();\nwhile (tileIterator.hasNext()) {\n    Tile tile = tileIterator.next();\n    tile.draw();\n}\n\\end{code}"}
