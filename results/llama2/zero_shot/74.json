Is this possible and what is the best way to do it?I've tried just creating both types of objects, for example ObjectOutputStream and DataOutputStream, but that doesn't seem to work.The reason I want to switch between them is to, for example, send a text command \"INFO\" that signals I'm about to send an object with information or a command \"DATA\" signalling that I'm about to send data.  Any advice on the best way to do this is appreciated.\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "You can't change the type of stream you're using without closing and reopening the socket.\nQuestion: How do I get the current time in milliseconds in Java?: :I'm trying to get the current time in milliseconds in Java.
