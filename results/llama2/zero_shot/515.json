When I started to study Java 8 I thought that Stream works in that way. But it does not, for the stream cannot be used twice.I thought about the following construction:IntStream fi;fi=IntStream.iterate(0, i -> fi[i-1]+fi[i-2]);But that way it won't work - I can't get an item from the stream by index.The other problem is that if I'll later go along the stream, it will be consumed and I can't use it repeatedly. If I copy the stream to List, it is not lazy anymore.As a result, I need some construction that I can address by index. As fibo(i). Edit. Obviously, the solution cannot be a stream, for the stream cannot be used twice.
