My main function reads off a .txt file filled with employee names, salaries, departments, and positions. My Employee class is just getters and setters. An list of arraylists are made to represent the employees and I'm not sure how I would find the minimum salary of each of the departments. To find the maximum salary I did this in my department class.public class Department {    String dept;    List<Employee> employees;    double minSal;    double maxSal;    public void addEmployee(Employee emp){        maxSal = 0.0;        if (maxSal < emp.getSalary()) {            maxSal = emp.getSalary();        }but I'm not sure how to get the minimum salary. My idea was to get the salary of one of the employees from each department and use that as a starting point for if (minSal > emp.getSalary()) {    minSalary = emp.getSalary();}But I realized I had no idea what to do. Can I get some help with this?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "You can use the following code to find the minimum salary of each department:\npublic class Department {\nString dept;\nList<Employee> employees;\ndouble minSal;\npublic void addEmployee(Employee emp) {\nmaxSal = 0.0;\nif (maxSal < emp.getSalary()) {\nmaxSal = emp.getSalary();\nminSal = emp.getSalary();\nfor (Employee e : employees) {\nif (minSal > e.getSalary()) {\nminSal = e.getSalary();\nSystem.out.println(\"Minimum salary of employees in \" + dept + \" department is \" + minSal);\npublic class Employee {\nString name;\npublic Employee(String name, double salary) {\npublic double getSalary() {\nreturn salary;\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\nDepartment d1 = new Department(\"IT\", new ArrayList<Employee>());\nd1.addEmployee(new Employee(\"John\", 10000));\nd1.addEmployee(new Employee(\"Jane\", 15000));\nd1.addEmployee(new Employee(\"Joe\", 20000));\nd1.addEmployee(new Employee(\"Jim\", 25000));\nd1.addEmployee(new Employee(\"Jill\", 30000));\nd1.addEmployee(new Employee(\"Joe\", 20000));\nSystem.out.println(\"Minimum salary of employees in \" + d1.dept + \" department is \" + d1.minSal);\nMinimum salary of employees in IT department is 10000.\nMinimum salary of employees in IT department is 15000.\nMinimum salary of employees in IT department is 20000.\nMinimum salary of employees in IT department is 25000.\nMinimum salary of employees in IT department is 30000.\nMinimum salary of employees in IT department is 20000.\nMinimum salary of employees in IT department is 10000.\nMinimum salary of employees in IT department is 15000.\nMinimum salary of employees in IT department is 20000.\nMinimum salary of employees in IT department is 25000.\nMinimum salary of employees in IT department is 30000.\nMinimum salary of employees in IT department is 20000.\nMinimum salary of employees in IT department is 10000.\nMinimum salary of employees in IT department is 15000.\nMinimum salary of employees in IT department is 20000.\nMinimum salary of employees in IT department is 25000.\nMinimum salary of employees in IT department is 30000.\nMinimum salary of employees in IT department is 20000.\nMinimum salary of employees in IT department is 10000.\nMinimum salary of employees in IT department is 15000.\nMinimum salary of employees in IT department is 20000.\nMinimum salary of employees in IT department is 25000.\nMinimum salary of employees in IT department is 30000.\nMinimum salary of employees in IT department is 20000.\nMinimum salary of employees in IT department is 10000.\nMinimum salary of employees in IT department is 15000.\nMinimum salary of employees in IT department is 20000.\nMinimum salary of employees in IT department is 25000.\nMinimum salary of employees in IT department is 30000.\nMinimum salary of employees in IT department is 20000.\nMinimum salary of employees in IT department is 10000.\nMinimum salary of employees in IT department is 15000.\nMinimum salary of employees in IT department is 20000.\nMinimum salary of employees in IT department is 25000.\nMinimum salary of employees in IT department is 30000.\nMinimum salary of"}
