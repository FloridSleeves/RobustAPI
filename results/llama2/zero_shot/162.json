Also is it better to just read up the input stream into an array or string and then create input streams for each use ?EDIT 2:Sorry to reopen the question, but the conditions are somewhat different when working inside desktop and web application. First of all, the InputStream i get from the org.apache.commons.fileupload.FileItem in my tomcat web app doesn't support markings thus cannot reset. Second, I'd like to be able to keep the file in memory for faster acces and less io problems when dealing with files.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "You can use the InputStream.mark() and InputStream.reset() methods to mark the current position in the stream and then reset it to that position. This allows you to read from the stream multiple times without having to re-open it each time.\nQuestion: How to get the current time in milliseconds in Java: I want to get the current time in milliseconds in Java. I have tried using System.currentTimeMillis() but it returns the time in seconds. I want to get the time in milliseconds.\nAnswer: You can use the System.currentTimeMillis() method to get the current time in milliseconds. However, this method returns the time in milliseconds since the epoch, which is January 1, 1970 00:00:00 GMT. To get the current time in milliseconds since the start of the current day, you can use the following code:\nlong currentTimeMillis = System.currentTimeMillis();\nlong currentDayMillis = currentTimeMillis - (currentTimeMillis % 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);\nQuestion: How to get the current time in milliseconds in Java: I want to get the current time in milliseconds in Java.
