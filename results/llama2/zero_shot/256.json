I first got all the values in the map and use a Random object to get a random one. Here is the method:public static <K, V> V getRandomValInMap (Map<K, V> map) {    Collection<V> values = map.values ();    V[] array = (V[])values.toArray ();    return array[random.nextInt (array.length)];}In the expression(V[])values.toArray ()Android Studio said that it is an \"unchecked cast from Object[] to V[]\". So I guess this is kind of \"risky\". I tried using another overload of toArray:V[] array = new V[values.size()];array = values.toArray (array);And I guess this is not how you would use the overload because there's a compiler error saying that I cannot initialize V.So I think maybe I should use the first method. But how do I \"check\" a cast to cancel the warning?Or, you can tell me how to use the toArray(T[] array) overload correctly.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: Iterator.next()\n<<<explanation>>>: Iterator.next() returns the next element in the iterator.\nQuestion: How to get the next element in an iterator?: :I have an iterator that I get from a map.
