I am completely lost after missing a class.  I need to be able to out put to a txt file the Total, Percentage, Highest, Lowest and Grade.  I have it where I can input the 5 scores given to me but the rest is not working.  I am completely lost, no idea where I need to go from what I have.  I can use a loop but its not necessary.import java.util.Scanner;public class BenefieldProgram4 { public static void main(String[ ] args)  {         Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);         System.out.println(\"Enter 5 Grades:\");         System.out.println(\"\");         keyboard.nextDouble();         double a, b, c, d, e; //5 Grades         double sum = 0;     // total         double avg;        // percentage         double min = 1;    // lowest grade         double max = 100;  // highest grade         //Calculations         a = keyboard.nextDouble();         b = keyboard.nextDouble();         c = keyboard.nextDouble();         d = keyboard.nextDouble();         e = keyboard.nextDouble();         keyboard.close();         sum = (a+b+c+d+e);         System.out.println(\"Total Score=:\"+sum);         avg =(a+b+c+d+e)/500;         System.out.println(\"Percentage =: \"+avg);          max = Double.MAX_VALUE;           System.out.println(\"Highest Score= \" +max);         min = Double.MIN_VALUE;         System.out.println(\"Lowest Score= \" +min);         if (avg >= 90)            System.out.println(\"Grade= A\");            else if (avg >=80)            System.out.println(\"Grade= B\");            else if (avg >= 70)            System.out.println(\"Grade= C\");            else if (avg >= 60)            System.out.println(\"Grade= D\");            else            System.out.println(\"Grade= F\");             } }}Edit\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "You can use the following code to calculate the total, percentage, highest, lowest and grade.\n\n\\begin{code}\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class BenefieldProgram4 {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);\n        System.out.println(\"Enter 5 Grades:\");\n        System.out.println(\"\");\n        keyboard.nextDouble();\n        double a, b, c, d, e; //5 Grades\n        double sum = 0; // total\n        double avg; // percentage\n        double min = 1; // lowest grade\n        double max = 100; // highest grade\n        //Calculations\n        a = keyboard.nextDouble();\n        b = keyboard.nextDouble();\n        c = keyboard.nextDouble();\n        d = keyboard.nextDouble();\n        e = keyboard.nextDouble();\n        keyboard.close();\n        sum = (a + b + c + d + e);\n        avg = (a + b + c + d + e) / 5;\n        max = Double.MAX_VALUE;\n        System.out.println(\"Highest Score= \" + max);\n        min = Double.MIN_VALUE;\n        System.out.println(\"Lowest Score= \" + min);\n        if (avg >= 90) {\n            System.out.println(\"Grade= A\");\n        } else if (avg >= 80) {\n            System.out.println(\"Grade= B\");\n        } else if (avg >= 70) {\n            System.out.println(\"Grade= C\");\n        } else if (avg >= 60) {\n            System.out.println(\"Grade= D\");\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"Grade= F\");\n        }\n        System.out.println(\"Total Score=:\" + sum);\n        System.out.println(\"Percentage =: \" + avg);\n    }\n}\n\\end{code}\n\nComment: Thank you so much!  I was able to get it to work.  I am still learning how to use the API.  I am not sure how to use the API to print the total, percentage, highest, lowest and grade.
