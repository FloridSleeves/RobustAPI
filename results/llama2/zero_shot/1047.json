For each client_123, I will have two keys with their values as shown below.test_client_123=7|0.1|0.2|0.3|0.3test_abc_pqr_client_123=16|5.5562501|5.1999998|13.6000004|13.6000004test_client_987=9|0.3|0.4|0.7|0.7test_abc_pqr_client_987=10|2.222|3.333|4.567|7.876  This is just an example, I will have many more key/value pairs in same format. Only difference will be client_123 will be some other clients like client_543 and after = numbers might be different in pipe as well. That's all.What does each value mean in pipe delimited format: Here 7 is count, 0.1 is average in ms, 0.2 is Median in ms, 0.3 is 95th percentile in ms and 0.3 again is 99th percentile in ms. Similarly for second line as well. And it will be in this format always.Problem Statement:For this line test_client_123=7|0.1|0.2|0.3|0.3, I need to make below new key/value pair and load it in same map:test_in_process_client_123_count=7test_in_process_client_123_avg_in_ms=0.1test_in_process_client_123_median_in_ms=0.2test_in_process_client_123_95_in_ms=0.3test_in_process_client_123_99_in_ms=0.3And similarly for this line test_abc_pqr_client_123=16|5.5562501|5.1999998|13.6000004|13.6000004, I want to make below new key/value pair and load it in same map:test_abc_pqr_client_123_count=16test_abc_pqr_client_123_avg_in_ms=5.5562501test_abc_pqr_client_123_median_in_ms=5.1999998test_abc_pqr_client_123_95_in_ms=13.6000004test_abc_pqr_client_123_99_in_ms=13.6000004How can I achieve this?
