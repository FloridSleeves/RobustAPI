I am working with NetBeans and tomcat as the server for testing. I have the GameSettings.html which the user choose the board size and press submit.  The data is being sent to servlet named: GameSettingsServlet.java  There I pull out the boardSize and parse it to an integer:  @Overrideprotected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)        throws ServletException, IOException {   createEngine(request);   processRequest(request, response);}private void createEngine(HttpServletRequest request){    int boardSize = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter(\"boardSize\"));    int numberOfPlayers = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter(\"numberOfPlayers\"));    m_Engine = new Engine(boardSize, numberOfPlayers );}I want to create the board with javaScript so I need to send the boardSize parameter to the   javaScript (which should run on BoardGame.html)  in order to know how much rows and columns to create.How can I pass the boardSize to the javaScript or HTML ?I searched on the web but I found only about JSP and I need it on HTML.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "You can use the following code to pass the board size to the JavaScript:\n\n<%@ page language=\"java\" contentType=\"text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\" pageEncoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"%>\n<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\">\n<title>Insert title here</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar boardSize = <%= request.getParameter(\"boardSize\") %>;\n</script>\n</body>\n</html>\n\nComment: I tried this but it didn't work.
