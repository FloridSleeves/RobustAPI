doing a For loop but also using an iterator for Linked List ( \"For, While\") Loop?: :I apologize for the basic question but my newness to Java is causing me some frustration and I am unable to find an elegant way to do this from my searches.I want to iterate through a linked list using a For construct but also have an numerical iterator so that I can break the loop after a certain number of iterations.I have this LL that I am iterating through:LinkedList<SearchResult> docSearch;I tried doing it like this but then only the iterator part worked (the result was always stuck on the first entry for each iteration)for (SearchResult result : docSearch) while (iter2 < 50)  { //do stuffiter2 = iter2 + 1;}Any advice is appreciated\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:",
