Perhaps storing the variables in an array? What I'd like to do, in case I'm faced with thousands of 2D arrays, is invoking the method with the value of a variable of a different data type, like this:String arrayToBeInvokedWith = \"array1\";method(arrayToBeInvokedWith){}(Yes, I do know this is too simplistic, but you can get the idea from it)Is there a similar solution? Any feedback is much appreciated.EDIT: All of the arrays have a same size.\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Map.get\n<<<code>>>: Map.get(variableName)\n<<<explanation>>>: The method Map.get returns the value of the variableName.\nQuestion: How to get the value of a variable in a method?\nI have a method that takes a variable as a parameter.
