I want it cut down to size... I don't care which elements I remove, I just want k of the elements removed.What's the most efficient way to do this (other than iterating)?Edit: k is not known in advance. Suggestions to based on other kinds of maps are relevant.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "You can use the removeAll() method of the Map interface.\nQuestion: How do I get the number of elements in a map?: :I have a map I've populated (say it's a HashMap).
