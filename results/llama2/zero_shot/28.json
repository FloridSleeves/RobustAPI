The problem is that when I press the button, it opens the new activity, but it also closes the current activity. I have tried to use finish() and startActivityForResult() but it doesn't work. I have also tried to use startActivity() but it doesn't work either. I have also tried to use startActivity(Intent intent) but it doesn't work either. I have also tried to use startActivity(Intent intent, int requestCode) but it doesn't work either. I have also tried to use startActivity(Intent intent, int requestCode, int resultCode) but it doesn't work either.
