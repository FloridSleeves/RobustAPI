Things are going well except there is a warning always appears in the logCat when I close the application:  IInputConnectionWrapper    showStatusIcon on inactive InputConnectionI am searching on the internet to find out the problem I found a post in StackOverflow Similar Problem. The difference is that I can send and receive information well in my program. The answer to this similar problem is that connection is not closed. Does that mean I didn't call socket.close(); after operation? That leads to a more complicated problem of implementation. First of all,  I want a single, static socket to listen and send to a server. Because I might not close the socket every time I transmit something, so I just close it after the listener finishes the work.Detail codes are posted belowI initialize connection in the constructor as:client = new Socket(mServerName, mport);out = new DataOutputStream(client.getOutputStream()); inFromServer = new InputStreamReader(client.getInputStream());reader = new BufferedReader(inFromServer);And let them be there during the whole process.I wrote transmitting from android to server into a function as following:public void sendRequest(int type, int what1, int what2, Object data){    try{        if(client.isConnected())        {            out.writeUTF(encoded(type,what1,what2,data) + \"\\n\");                    }    }catch(IOException e){        Log.e(TAG, \"IOException at SendRequest\");        e.printStackTrace();    }}Listener in a new thread:try {               String line = null;        while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null)        {            ReceiveHandler(line);        }    } catch (IOException e) {        Log.e(TAG, \"IOException at StartListen\");        e.printStackTrace();    }finally{        try {          // The Only Place that I close the Socket            inFromServer.close();            out.close();            reader.close();            client.close();        } catch (IOException e) {            Log.e(TAG, \"Close Socket with IOException \" + e.toString());            e.printStackTrace();        }     }My Question is:Is there something wrong with my implementation or are there better ways to do this?Thanks so much for your help!\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after you send the data.\nAnswer: I think you should close the socket after"}
