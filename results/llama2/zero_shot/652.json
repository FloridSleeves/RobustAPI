You can use the Map.get() method to retrieve the value associated with a key. In your case, you can use the Map.get() method to retrieve the value associated with the key \"music\" and the key \"film\".\nQuestion: Is it possible to link a string to an int?: :I want to be able to call on a certain int with the use of strings.

The Map.get() method returns an int value, so you can use the int value to access the int array. The int array can be accessed using the index of the key. For example, if the key is \"music\", then the index of the key is 0, and the value of the key is 0. If the key is \"film\", then the index of the key is 1, and the value of the key is 1.\nQuestion: Is it possible to link a string to an int?: :I want to be able to call on a certain int with the use of strings.
