It's in the class of the activity which contains the TextView. However, this function doesn't work when it's called from another class.The function looks like this:public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {    public void changeTest() {        TextView test = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.textViewTest);        guessedLetters.setText(\"test\");    }}If I call this function from my MainActivity, it works perfectly fine:public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {    @Override    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);        setContentView(R.layout.activity_gameplay);        changeTest();    }}But if I call it from a class that extends MainActivity, I get a java.lang.NullPointerException at android.app.Activity.findViewById(Activity.java:1884).public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {    @Override    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);        setContentView(R.layout.activity_gameplay);        MyClass myClass = new MyClass();        myClass.myFunction();    }}public class MyClass extends MainActivity {    public void myFunction() {        MainActivity mainActivity = new MainActivity();        mainActivity.changeTest();    }}How could I fix this?\nPlease using this api: Activity.findViewById.\nAnswer:", "response": "You can't call findViewById from another class.
