The API says it can be done with a Stream or a Writer/Reader, but I can't get it to work. I can do it manually, that is, if I read the file line by line and pass it through a PrintWriter.On the client side I've got roughly:socket = new Socket(host, port);outStream = socket.getOutputStream();out = new PrintWriter(outStream, true);in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file));...props.load(reader);props.store(out, null);On the server side the receiving bits look like:out = new PrintWriter(sock.getOutputStream(), true);inStream = sock.getInputStream();in = new BufferedReader( new InputStreamReader(inStream));...props.load(in); // hangs// doesn't get to code here...In this case it hangs at the props.load(in). Instead of doing props.load(in), I read it in line by line to make sure props.store(out, null) was working, and the data looks like its being transferred.Is there something about load/store I don't understand, or is it an issue with the Stream/Writer/Reader?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "Java streaming Properties over Socket: :First of all, this is a homework problem.
