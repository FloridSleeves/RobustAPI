I tried to create a class with two iterator objects and used the methods of the iterator objects to implement the interface Iterator. This part of the code is created by me and can be modified.class ZipIterator<T> implements Iterator<T>{int counter;Iterator<T> first;Iterator<T> second;ZipIterator (Iterator<T> f, Iterator<T> s){    first = f;    second = s;    counter = 0;}public T next (){    if (counter % 2 == 0)    {        counter++;        return first.next();    }    else    {        counter++;        return second.next();    }}public boolean hasNext (){    if (counter % 2 == 0)        return first.hasNext();    else        return second.hasNext();}}This works fine for two list with the same type. Here is the code and the output I used for the test:class IteratorUtils{public static void main (String[] args){    List<Integer> lst1 = new List<>();    List<Integer> lst2 = new List<>();    lst1.prepend(3);    lst1.prepend(2);    lst1.prepend(1);    lst2.prepend(8);    lst2.prepend(9);    lst2.prepend(10);    Iterator<Integer> it1 = lst1.getIterator();    Iterator<Integer> it2 = lst2.getIterator();    ZipIterator<Integer> zit = new ZipIterator<>(it1, it2);    while (zit.hasNext())    {        System.out.println(zit.next());    }}}Output:1102938Now I want to implement the ZipIterator in a generic way, so I can use two lists with different types of items (e.g. integer and string). I know I have to change the class ZipIterator so the method next() returns a generic type but I don't know how.This is a university task i have to do and the prof has left a hint \"use wild cards like: ? extends T, ? super T, ? extends Object\". But with the wild cards i can only specify the types in or against the inherits direction, right? Is this possible to change the ZipIterator class that way so it accepts two iterator objects with different types?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "You can use the wildcard to specify the type of the object returned by the next method.\nFor example, if you have a list of integers and a list of strings, you can use the following code:\nIterator<Integer> it1 = lst1.getIterator();\nIterator<String> it2 = lst2.getIterator();\nZipIterator<T> zit = new ZipIterator<>(it1, it2);\nwhile (zit.hasNext()) {\nSystem.out.println(zit.next());\nThis will print out the elements of both lists, one after the other.\nHowever, you should be aware that this approach has some limitations. For example, if the lists contain elements of different types, the next method may not be able to return a value of the correct type. In this case, you will need to use a different approach, such as using a custom iterator or using a different data structure.\nIn addition, the ZipIterator class is not designed to handle lists of different types. It is designed to handle lists of the same type, and it may not be able to handle lists of different types in a way that is efficient or reliable.\nOverall, while the ZipIterator class can be used to iterate through two lists with different types, it is not a general-purpose solution and may not be suitable for all use cases. It is important to carefully consider the limitations and potential issues before using this approach.\nPlease answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API <<<code>>>: $CODE <<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.
