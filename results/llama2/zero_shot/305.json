I am not sure how this would work. Ideas?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: Iterator<T> iterator = new Iterator<T>() {\n    public boolean hasNext() {\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    public T next() {\n        return null;\n    }\n};\n<<<explanation>>>: Iterator<T> iterator = new Iterator<T>() {\n    public boolean hasNext() {\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    public T next() {\n        return null;\n    }\n};\n\nQuestion: How to get the current value of a variable in a function? :I have a function that takes a variable and returns a value.
