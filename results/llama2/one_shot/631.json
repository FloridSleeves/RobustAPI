Can you help me with this?\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Map.get\n<<<code>>>: import java.util.HashMap;import java.util.Map;Map<String, Integer> freq = new HashMap<String, Integer>();Integer count = freq.get(word);if (count == null) {freq.put(word, 1);}else {freq.put(word, count + 1);}\n<<<explanation>>>: If you look at the API for Map, get operations usually return null when the map does not contain the requested element. Note that this will make a solution.\nQuestion: how to compare two hash maps?: :How to compare the values in both hash maps with the help of keys ? Since the keys are identical whereas values are'nt.and return boolean result for each key comparision.like:map1=[1,res][2,tr][3,677][4,cv]  map2=[1,res][2,cd][3,677][4,fs]It should return me truefalsetruefalse\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Map.get\n<<<code>>>: import java.util.HashMap;import java.util.Map;Map<String, Integer> freq1 = new HashMap<String, Integer>();Map<String, Integer> freq2 = new HashMap<String, Integer>();Integer count = freq1.get(word);if (count == null) {freq1.put(word, 1);}else {freq1.put(word, count + 1);}count = freq2.get(word);if (count == null) {freq2.put(word, 1);}else {freq2.put(word, count + 1);}if (freq1.get(word) == freq2.get(word)) {return true;}else {return false;}\n<<<explanation>>>: You can use the get method to get the value of a key. If the key is not present in the map, it will return null. You can use the if statement to check if the value is null or not. If the value is null, it will return true. If the value is not null, it will return false.\nQuestion: How to get the value of a key in a HashMap?: :I have a HashMap that contains a key and a value. I want to get the value of the key.
