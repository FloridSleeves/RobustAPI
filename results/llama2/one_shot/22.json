I am confused how does it work? why doesn't it give error just like we get in java code? and most importantly, how does environment decide to which component it needs to invoke? I understand the process of id generation is automated, which gets added to R.java For instance, if we have same IDs, say \"image1\" in two XMLs, say \"layout1\" & \"layout2\". but in R.java it won't have 2 IDs. that means at a time it will reference only 1 component. In case we have to use 2 XMLs in an Activity, one as activity.setcontentview(layout1) and another as a PopupWindow.setContentView(layout2). What will happen in such case?\nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Activity.setContentView\n<<<code>>>: @Override\npublic void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n    Button myButton = (Button) findViewById(R.id.my_button);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You can findViewById of the current view hierarchy set to the activity. You cannot have same id for the view's in the same view tree. (must be unique).\nQuestion: Using keypress in android: :I am creating an android application, a converter. Every time I am going to press any number, I want it to be displayed automatically on a textfield. I don't know how to use the keypress in android application. Is it just like using keypress in a simple java program, let's say ran on netbeans?\nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Activity.setContentView\n<<<code>>>: @Override\npublic void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\nsuper.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\nButton myButton = (Button) findViewById(R.id.my_button);\nmyButton.setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener() {\npublic void onClick(View v) {\ntextView.setText(\"\" + v.getKeyCode());\nQuestion: I am trying to create a simple calculator application.
