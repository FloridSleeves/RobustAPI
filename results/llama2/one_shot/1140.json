As you can see an empty field is still correctly surrounded by tabs. Data is collected using a loop :\n\n while ((strLine = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(strLine, \"\t\");\n    String test = st.nextToken();\n    ...\n    }\nYet Java ignores this \"empty string\" and skips the field.\n\nIs there a way to circumvent this behaviour and force java to read in empty fields anyway?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: public class TestStringTokenStrict {\n\n/**\n * Strict implementation of StringTokenizer\n * \n * @param str\n * @param delim\n * @param strict\n *            true = include NULL Token\n * @return\n */\nstatic StringTokenizer getStringTokenizerStrict(String str, String delim, boolean strict) {\n    StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(str, delim, strict);\n    StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();\n\n    while (st.hasMoreTokens()) {\n        String s = st.nextToken();\n        if (s.equals(delim)) {\n            sb.append(\" \").append(delim);\n        } else {\n            sb.append(s).append(delim);\n            if (st.hasMoreTokens())\n                st.nextToken();\n        }\n    }\n    return (new StringTokenizer(sb.toString(), delim));\n}\n\nstatic void altStringTokenizer(StringTokenizer st) {\n    while (st.hasMoreTokens()) {\n        String type = st.nextToken();\n        String one = st.nextToken();\n        String two = st.nextToken();\n        String three = st.nextToken();\n        String four = st.nextToken();\n        String five = st.nextToken();\n\n        System.out.println(\n                \"[\" + type + \"] [\" + one + \"] [\" + two + \"] [\" + three + \"] [\" + four + \"] [\" + five + \"]\");\n    }\n}\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    String input = \"Record|One||Three||Five\";\n    altStringTokenizer(getStringTokenizerStrict(input, \"|\", true));\n}}\n<<<explanation>>>: The object your method decompressGZIP() needs is a byte[].\n\nSo the basic, technical answer to the question you have asked is:\nQuestion: multi-d array?: :I'm operating on a file that has this kind of format:LAWS303 RHLT1   10  84  AITKEN  WU  LAWS314 RHLT3   15  2   PARADZA VISSER  LAWS329 EALT006 6   62  AITKEN  WILSON  LAWS334 HMLT105 2   43  ANDREW  INKSTER LAWS334 HMLT206 2   62  JULIAN  YOUNG   LAWS340 RHLT1   11  87  AL  YANG    The goal of this program is that for each day (the third column) of the month, each course code (first column) should be printed along with the total number of students attending (fourth column) for the course on that day.  From my thinkering, this involves either reading the file a lot of times (ew!) or loading the three salient values (day, course, headcount) into some sort of array and operating on that instead.  Despite being fairly familiar with what a multi dimensional array is, this one has repeatedly caused my head to implode.  I've got the pseudo code for this program written out in front of me and my mind draws a blank when it comes to the line that defines the array.  The dayOfMonth can remain a string because it'll only be compared to another string. The courseCode obviously needs to be a string, too.  However, the headCount ideally would be numeric; it'll be added to as each line of the file is processed. The relationship between the three is basically that there can be many courseCodes per dayOfMonth, but only one headCount per courseCode as I'll be adding to it as I read it all into the array.So, in derpspeak, this is how it should roughly look:{String dayOfMonth = {{String courseCode}, {int headCount}}}The two issues I have here, are...a) that I'm not sure how to actually code this kind of funky array in there andb) as I can't really wrap my brain around it to begin with, there's a really good chance that I've essentially just designed something completely wrong for what I need.  Or impossible.  Both?For example, the array will start off empty.  I'd want to add a dayOfMonth, courseCode and headCount to start it off.  But I couldn't just go array.add(dayOfMonth) because it's expecting an array, leading me to suspect I should be using something else.
