I know what wait() and notify() does, but I can't seem to be able to wrap my ead around what exactly I would need to do to make them merge into one array. Should I:Create a method inside the thread-class that merges the arrays?Create a new thread for every other thread that is done, pass the two sorted word-arrays as a parameter, and let that thread do the sorting?Something else I haven't thought of.
