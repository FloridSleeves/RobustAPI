For example, I get: ..., parameter:\"Dep\\u00f3sitos\" ,...Instead of: ..., parameter:\"Dep\u00f3sitos\" ,...I've tried using:@Produces(\"application/json; charset=UTF-8\")but the problem remains.  If I return it as XML using just:@Produces(\"application/xml\")Everything is ok.What do I need to set to produce the right type?\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: String.getBytes\n<<<code>>>: \ntry { byte[] b = string.getBytes(Charset.forName(\"UTF-8\")); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The object your method decompressGZIP() needs is a byte[].\n\nComment: Please use the code formatting tool to format your code.\n\nComment: I'm not sure what you're asking.
