But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Looking for an example for inserting content into the response using a servlet filter: :I've been searching the net and stackoverflow for an example of somebody inserting content into the response using a servlet filter, but can only find examples of people capturing/compressing the output and/or changing the headers. My goal is to append a chunk of HTML just before the closing </body> of all HTML responses.I'm working on a solution that extends the HttpServletResponseWrapper to use my own PrintWriter, then overriding the write methods thereon. Inside the write method I'm storing the last 7 characters to see if it's equal to the closing body tag, and then I write my HTML chunk plus the closing body tag, before continuing normal write operations for the rest of the document.I feel that somebody must have solved this problem already, and probably more elegantly than I will. I'd appreciate any examples of how to use a servlet filter to insert content into a response.UPDATEDResponding to a comment, I am also trying to implement the CharResponseWrapper from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/filters-137243.html. Here is my code:PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();CharResponseWrapper wrappedResponse = new CharResponseWrapper(        (HttpServletResponse)response);chain.doFilter(wrappedRequest, wrappedResponse);String s = wrappedResponse.toString();if (wrappedResponse.getContentType().equals(\"text/html\") &&        StringUtils.isNotBlank(s)) {    CharArrayWriter caw = new CharArrayWriter();    caw.write(s.substring(0, s.indexOf(\"</body>\") - 1));    caw.write(\"WTF</body></html>\");    response.setContentLength(caw.toString().length());    out.write(caw.toString());}else {    out.write(wrappedResponse.toString());}out.close();I am also wrapping the request, but that code works and shouldn't affect the response.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break.
