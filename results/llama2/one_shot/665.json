But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Behavior of Java sockets when closing output stream: :Can someone explain the following behavior in Java sockets:The general idea is this:Open socket, Obtain I/O streams.Write request, Close out streamRead Response, Close in streamClose socket.Here's my question / issue.If I use a PrintWriter for output, and then close it, It closes the whole socket, and the subsequent read operation fails miserably.Instead if I directly use the socket's shutdownOutput() method, it correctly closes the output stream channel, while keeping the socket alive.Why would closing the PrintWriter object take the whole socket down with it?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break.
