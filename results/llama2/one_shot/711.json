But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Split Flat File using Java: :I am fairly new to java and need some help.  I have flat file with 10 columns and a total of, lets say, 9750 rows.  All the rows are pipe delimited.  I need to split the file into 2000 rows each (5 files). How do I do this in Java?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine()\n<<<code>>>: try { BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream())); String line = bufferedReader.readLine(); while (line != null) { System.out.println(line); line = bufferedReader.readLine(); } } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: BufferedReader.readLine() returns a String which is the line read from the input stream.
