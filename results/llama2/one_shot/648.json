Can you help me with this?\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Map.get\n<<<code>>>: import java.util.HashMap;import java.util.Map;Map<String, Integer> freq = new HashMap<String, Integer>();Integer count = freq.get(word);if (count == null) {freq.put(word, 1);}else {freq.put(word, count + 1);}\n<<<explanation>>>: If you look at the API for Map, get operations usually return null when the map does not contain the requested element. Note that this will make a solution.\nQuestion: get fields names of certain types: :I have an example class below and I want to return all class fields of certain type, in this example of type Image. public class Contact {    private String surname, lastname, address;    private int age, floor;    private Image contactPhoto, companyPhoto;    private boolean isEmployed;    public String[] getAllImages() {        String images[] = // missing code        return images;        // in this case, I want to return {\"contactPhoto\",\"companyPhoto\"}    }}I need a help here.
