But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: why i cant export all line to text file?: :my code is creating empty text file although  I have tried to use the same code which used to work for small data output text file output should look like this ClassMetrics 3 1 0 3 18 0 0 3 2 0.0000 66 1.0000 0 0.0000 0.5556 0 0   20.6667~ void (): 1~ public gr.spinellis.ckjm.ClassMetrics getMetrics(String arg0): 2~ public void printMetrics(gr.spinellis.ckjm.CkjmOutputHandler arg0):  3but I get an empty text filethis is the source code package javaapplication11;import java.io.*;public class CmdTest {    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {        ProcessBuilder builder = new ProcessBuilder(\"cmd.exe\",\"/c\",                \"java -jar C:\\\\Users\\\\hp\\\\Desktop\\\\ckjm-1.99.jar  C:\\\\Users\\\\hp\\\\Desktop\\\\*.class\");        builder.redirectErrorStream(true);        Process p = builder.start();        BufferedReader r = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(                p.getInputStream()));        String line;        while (true) {            line = r.readLine();            if (line == null) {                break;            }            PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hp\\\\Desktop\\\\result3.txt\", \"UTF-8\");            // writer.println(\"\\t\\t\\tWMC DIT NOC CBO RFC LCOM Ce NPM\");            System.out.println(line);            writer.write(line);            writer.close();        }    }}\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break.
