The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: how to get wifi password from cmd with java: :I'm trying supply my wifi connection password with java. but I have to do it as an admin.try {    Process p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(\"netsh.exe wlan show profiles name=superonline key=clear\");    BufferedReader bf = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(p.getInputStream()));    while (bf.readLine() != null)        System.out.println(bf.readLine());} catch (Exception ex) {    ex.printStackTrace();}When I try it as a standard user:When I try it as administrator:How can do this in java code?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: Process p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(\"netsh.exe wlan show profiles name=superonline key=clear\");\nBufferedReader bf = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(p.getInputStream()));\nwhile (bf.readLine() != null)\nSystem.out.println(bf.readLine());\n<<<explanation>>>: You can't do this from a standard user.
