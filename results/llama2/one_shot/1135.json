It looks like this:Shoes 10.00Jersey 20.00Cookies 15.00Light Bulbs 2.00Paper 5.00I want to map every item to how much it costs and my current code works just fine. However, it looks a bit clunky and initializes variables with null that my project's submission server doesn't like and treats as a bug. I'm looking for a way to translate this into something a lot more elegant and thus learn to read files another way apart from relying on the Scanner class. Maybe using BufferedReader or PrintReader or something of the ilk that I have never really grasped. Help appreciated.    private TreeMap<String, Double> prices = new TreeMap<String, Double>();     public void readFromFile(String fileName){                File file = new File(fileName);                Scanner sc = null; //Server treats this as a bug.                 try {                    sc = new Scanner(file);                } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {                    e.printStackTrace();                }                while (sc.hasNextLine()) {                    Scanner sc2 = new Scanner(sc.nextLine());                    while (sc2.hasNext()) {                        String s = sc2.next(); //Gets the item name                        prices.put(s, Double.parseDouble(sc2.next())); //The next word is the price                        }                    sc2.close();                    }}\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: public class TestStringTokenStrict {\n\n/**\n * Strict implementation of StringTokenizer\n * \n * @param str\n * @param delim\n * @param strict\n *            true = include NULL Token\n * @return\n */\nstatic StringTokenizer getStringTokenizerStrict(String str, String delim, boolean strict) {\n    StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(str, delim, strict);\n    StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();\n\n    while (st.hasMoreTokens()) {\n        String s = st.nextToken();\n        if (s.equals(delim)) {\n            sb.append(\" \").append(delim);\n        } else {\n            sb.append(s).append(delim);\n            if (st.hasMoreTokens())\n                st.nextToken();\n        }\n    }\n    return (new StringTokenizer(sb.toString(), delim));\n}\n\nstatic void altStringTokenizer(StringTokenizer st) {\n    while (st.hasMoreTokens()) {\n        String type = st.nextToken();\n        String one = st.nextToken();\n        String two = st.nextToken();\n        String three = st.nextToken();\n        String four = st.nextToken();\n        String five = st.nextToken();\n\n        System.out.println(\n                \"[\" + type + \"] [\" + one + \"] [\" + two + \"] [\" + three + \"] [\" + four + \"] [\" + five + \"]\");\n    }\n}\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    String input = \"Record|One||Three||Five\";\n    altStringTokenizer(getStringTokenizerStrict(input, \"|\", true));\n}}\n<<<explanation>>>: I'm trying to read a file that contains a list of items and their prices.
