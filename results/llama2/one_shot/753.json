But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Q re Java Programme to read from a text file, create an arraylist, reformat, and output to another file: :As a java student (beginner) I've just completed a task to write a program to perform the following tasks:Read the content of a text file;Pick out all words within the text, replacing all upper case letters with lower case ones;Produce a dictionary of the words appearing in the text (i.e., a list of the words in alphabetical order, one word per line, without duplication);Output the dictionary to another file.We were advised to have a single class containing our main method, and use the ArrayList, Scanner, PrintWriter and FileReader classes. I managed to do the below, which works, but it has raised some questions/fundamental gaps in my knowledge. I  believe that based on the principles of good O.O. programming practice, I should break the below down into a series of methods that have a single purpose, and then call those methods. However, I really struggle doing this. Can anyone please elaborate/advise a way to improve on that specific point? Or correct me if I'm wrong? public class Main{    private static ArrayList<String> dictionary;     private static ArrayList<String> tempdictionary;    public static void main() throws FileNotFoundException    {        Scanner inFile = new Scanner(new FileReader(\"H:\\\\csc8001\\\\results.txt\"));        dictionary = new ArrayList <>();        tempdictionary = new ArrayList <>();        while (inFile.hasNext()) {             dictionary.add(inFile.next().toLowerCase().replaceAll(\"[^a-zA-Z ]\", \"\"));        }        inFile.close();        PrintWriter outFile = new PrintWriter(\"H:\\\\csc8001\\\\results1.txt\");        int index = 0;        for (String a : dictionary)        {            if (!tempdictionary.contains(a)){                 tempdictionary.add(a);            } else {                index++;            }        }        Collections.sort(tempdictionary);        for (int i=0; i<tempdictionary.size(); i++)            outFile.println(tempdictionary.get(i));        outFile.flush();        outFile.close();    }}\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break.
