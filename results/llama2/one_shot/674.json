But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Where compiled code will be stored if not in class file: :Recently I came across a query while reading THE STRUCTURE OF THE JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINEOn page no-5 ch. 2,Compiled code to be executed by the Java Virtual Machine is  represented using a hardware- and operating system-independent binary  format, typically (but not necessarily) stored in a file, known as the  class file format.That bracket But not necessarily is the reason.Question is, In which case compiled code will not be stored in class file ? and if it will not be stored in class file, then where and how ?Edit : Please note that question is not about ClassLoader.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break.
