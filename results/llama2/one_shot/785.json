But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Java FileReader not finding files: :I decided to start a new question so it can strictly focus on the FileReader errors.This is a method that takes in a file name, and a desired output name for a new file. Say the inputted filename is \"hello.txt\"... the method makes it something like \"/home/User/hello.txt\", which goes into the FileReader as a parameter. The problem is that I get this as output \"/home/User/hello.txt (No such file or directory)\", even though the file does exist and the directory structure and permissions are correct.I couldn't get the method to work with just referencing the file in the local directory of the .class and .java file so I googled my way to find that absolute specifying is not a bad option.Any input is helpful!public void fileGenerator(String in, String out) {      try {    String current_directory = System.getProperty(\"user.dir\");    Scanner input = new Scanner(new FileReader(current_directory+\"/\"+in));    PrintWriter output = new PrintWriter(current_directory+\"/\"+out);        while(input.hasNext()) {        String line = input.nextLine();     output.println(line);    output.close();     }  }  catch (Exception e) { System.out.println(e.getMessage()); }}Here is the requested stacktrace:java.io.FileNotFoundException: /home/User/hello.txt(No such file or directory)    at java.io.FileInputStream.open(Native Method)    at java.io.FileInputStream.<init>(FileInputStream.java:137)    at java.io.FileInputStream.<init>(FileInputStream.java:96)    at java.io.FileReader.<init>(FileReader.java:58)    at TEST.fileGenerator(TEST.java:131)    at TEST.generateCSV_TWO(TEST.java:122)    at TEST$4.actionPerformed(TEST.java:102)    at javax.swing.AbstractButton.fireActionPerformed(AbstractButton.java:2012)    at javax.swing.AbstractButton$Handler.actionPerformed(AbstractButton.java:2335)    at javax.swing.DefaultButtonModel.fireActionPerformed(DefaultButtonModel.java:404)    at javax.swing.DefaultButtonModel.setPressed(DefaultButtonModel.java:259)    at javax.swing.plaf.basic.BasicButtonListener.mouseReleased(BasicButtonListener.java:253)    at java.awt.Component.processMouseEvent(Component.java:6203)    at javax.swing.JComponent.processMouseEvent(JComponent.java:3267)    at java.awt.Component.processEvent(Component.java:5968)    at java.awt.Container.processEvent(Container.java:2105)    at java.awt.Component.dispatchEventImpl(Component.java:4564)    at java.awt.Container.dispatchEventImpl(Container.java:2163)    at java.awt.Component.dispatchEvent(Component.java:4390)    at java.awt.LightweightDispatcher.retargetMouseEvent(Container.java:4461)    at java.awt.LightweightDispatcher.processMouseEvent(Container.java:4125)    at java.awt.LightweightDispatcher.dispatchEvent(Container.java:4055)    at java.awt.Container.dispatchEventImpl(Container.java:2149)    at java.awt.Window.dispatchEventImpl(Window.java:2478)    at java.awt.Component.dispatchEvent(Component.java:4390)    at java.awt.EventQueue.dispatchEventImpl(EventQueue.java:649)    at java.awt.EventQueue.access$000(EventQueue.java:96)    at java.awt.EventQueue$1.run(EventQueue.java:608)    at java.awt.EventQueue$1.run(EventQueue.java:606)    at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method)    at java.security.AccessControlContext$1.doIntersectionPrivilege(AccessControlContext.java:105)    at java.security.AccessControlContext$1.doIntersectionPrivilege(AccessControlContext.java:116)    at java.awt.EventQueue$2.run(EventQueue.java:622)    at java.awt.EventQueue$2.run(EventQueue.java:620)    at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method)    at java.security.AccessControlContext$1.doIntersectionPrivilege(AccessControlContext.java:105)    at java.awt.EventQueue.dispatchEvent(EventQueue.java:619)    at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpOneEventForFilters(EventDispatchThread.java:275)    at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEventsForFilter(EventDispatchThread.java:200)    at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEventsForHierarchy(EventDispatchThread.java:190)    at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEvents(EventDispatchThread.java:185)    at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEvents(EventDispatchThread.java:177)    at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.run(EventDispatchThread.java:138)\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break.
