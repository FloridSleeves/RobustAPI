But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: How to create a txt file in Java?: :I'm just want a program to register a user and then create a txt file to store there the information. I know it has to be with createNewFile method but I do not know how to use it. I'd try this in my code:import java.util.*;public class File{public static void main(String args[]){    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);byte option=0;    do{        System.out.println(\"\\nMENU:\\n\");        System.out.println(\"0.-EXIT\");        System.out.println(\"1.-REGISTER USER\");        System.out.println(\"\\nPLEASE ENTER YOUR CHOICE:\");        option = sc.nextByte();    }while(option!=0);}//main}//File\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break.
