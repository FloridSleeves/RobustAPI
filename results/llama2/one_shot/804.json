That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: JAVA: :I have a very stupid problem... I cannot get know how to save the results in output file that second array is save in a lower line.This is how it saves:dist[0 10 13 10 6 18 ] pred[-15 2 5 1 4 ] I want it to save like this:dist[0 10 13 10 6 18 ]pred[-15 2 5 1 4 ]CODE:try{outputFile = new File(\"Out0304.txt\");out = new FileWriter(outputFile);out.write(\"\\n\" + \"dist[\");out.write(\"\\n\");for (Top way : tops){    out.write(way.shortest_path + \" \");}out.write(\"]\\n\");out.write(\"\\n\");out.write(\"\\n\" + \"pred[\");for (Top ww : tops){    if (ww.previous != null) {        out.write(ww.previous.number + \" \");    }            else{        out.write(\"-1\");    }}out.write(\"] \\n \");out.close();}  catch (IOException e){System.out.println(\"Blad: \" + e.toString());}}}\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break.
