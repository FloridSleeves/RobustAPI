But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Taking data from one text file and moving it to a new text file: :I have a file that has data inside of it. In my main method I read in the file and closed the file. I call another method that created a new file inside of the same folder of the original file. So now I have two files, the original file and the file that is being made from the method that I call. I need another method that takes the data from the original file and writes it to the new file that is created. How do I do that?import java.io.*;import java.util.Scanner;import java.util.*;import java.lang.*;public class alice {    public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException {        String filename = (\"/Users/DAndre/Desktop/Alice/wonder1.txt\");        File textFile = new File(filename);        Scanner in = new Scanner(textFile);        in.close();        newFile();    }    public static void newFile() {        final Formatter x;        try {            x = new Formatter(\"/Users/DAndre/Desktop/Alice/new1.text\");            System.out.println(\"you created a new file\");        } catch (Exception e) {            System.out.println(\"Did not work\");        }    }    private static void newData() {    }}\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break.
