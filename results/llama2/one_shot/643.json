Can you help me with this?\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Map.get\n<<<code>>>: import java.util.HashMap;import java.util.Map;Map<String, Integer> freq = new HashMap<String, Integer>();Integer count = freq.get(word);if (count == null) {freq.put(word, 1);}else {freq.put(word, count + 1);}\n<<<explanation>>>: If you look at the API for Map, get operations usually return null when the map does not contain the requested element. Note that this will make a solution.\nQuestion: How can a HashMap consist only of one entry/object?: :I would like to have a HashMap with only one key-value object.I have created the following HashMap:    HashMap <Integer,String>DocsCollection = new HashMap <Integer,String>();In the HashMap I would like to have only one entry/object.The key type is an Integer.The value type is a String.e.g.  = <1,\"foo.txt\"> Every time I find a specific word in a file I would like toIncrement the counter in keyAdd the new file in the valuee.g. Let's say that I'm searching for the word \"Hello\" in a DocsCollection,I have to store for every appearance of the word \"Hello\" the term frequency and concatenate the new file to the previous value.<3,\"foo.txt,hello.txt,test.txt\"> 3 means that I've found the word \"Hello\" in three files.and the Value consists of the files where the word was foundIf I use the method put, a new entry is created in the HashMap cause the key changes.It's not stable. It begins with \"1\" but when I find the word second time , the key increments and then the put method inserts a new entry with a new keyBut i would like to have only one entry and modify the key.Can this be done?How can i have only one object in a HashMap and modify the key every time?   DocsCollection.put(2,\"foo.txt,hello.txt\"); Thanks, in advance\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Map.get\n<<<code>>>: import java.util.HashMap;import java.util.Map;Map<String, Integer> freq = new HashMap<String, Integer>();Integer count = freq.get(word);if (count == null) {freq.put(word, 1);}else {freq.put(word, count + 1);}\n<<<explanation>>>: If you look at the API for Map, get operations usually return null when the map does not contain the requested element.
