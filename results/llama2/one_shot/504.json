Try to just use the value of the foreach inside the loop.\nQuestion: get the place from 4 points: :I have an array of 4 integers, which represent the scores of 4 players. I want to get another array that gives me the ranking of the players based on their scores.For example: Given the scores {10,20,15,40}I want the ranking to be {4,2,3,1}The lowest score being rank 4 and the highest score being rank 1.The biggest problem is when there are multiple players with the same score. For example {10,10,20,40} then I want to get {34,34,2,1} (34 because the third and fourth place are shared by two players)Another example is {40,40,10,20}, which should give the ranking {12,12,4,3} (12 for shared first and second place)I have for the moment two dubble arrays to come to that result, but I think it can be better, but I don't find how. My biggest problem now is when we have 3 same scores: {40,40,40,10} than I should have the result {123,123,123,4}I hope you understand my question and of course can help me to find a solution.thanks\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: for(Iterator<DataSnapshot> it = dataSnapshot.getChildren().iterator(); it.hasNext(); ){\n  i = i + 1;\n    names.add(it.next().getValue(String.class));\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You're creating a new dataSnapshot.getChildren().iterator() in every iteration of your loop.
