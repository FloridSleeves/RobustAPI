The code is pretty long just to test if a file is blank and then if it isn't, write onto it. Either way, the line if (!(data.equals(\"\")) && !(data.equals(null))) doesn't work and even when the file is blank, it still goes through the Alert.FileInputStream fIn = null;String data = null;InputStreamReader isr = null;try{    char[] inputBuffer = new char[1024];    fIn = openFileInput(\"test.txt\");    isr = new InputStreamReader(fIn);    isr.read(inputBuffer);    data = new String(inputBuffer);    isr.close();    fIn.close();}catch(IOException e){}// this is the check for if the data inputted from the file is NOT blankif (!(data.equals(\"\")) && !(data.equals(null))){    AlertDialog.Builder builder = new AlertDialog.Builder(Main.this);    builder.setMessage(\"Clear your file?\" + '\\n' + \"This cannot be undone.\")    .setCancelable(false)    .setPositiveButton(\"Yes\", new DialogInterface.OnClickListener() {        public void onClick(DialogInterface dialog, int id) {            EditText we = (EditText)findViewById(R.id.txtWrite);            FileOutputStream fOut = null;            OutputStreamWriter osw = null;            try{                fOut = openFileOutput(\"test.txt\", Context.MODE_PRIVATE);                osw = new OutputStreamWriter(fOut);                osw.write(\"\");                osw.close();                fOut.close();                we.setText(\"\");            }catch(Exception e){}        }    })    .setNegativeButton(\"No\", new DialogInterface.OnClickListener() {        public void onClick(DialogInterface dialog, int id) {            dialog.cancel();        }    });    AlertDialog alert = builder.create();    alert.show();}Also, if anyone has a way of shorting up this code, I would be greatful!\nPlease using this api: File.createNewFile.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: File.createNewFile\n<<<code>>>: File file = new File(\"foo/bar.txt\")\ntry{\n    file.getParentFile().mkdirs();\n    file.createNewFile();\n} except {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");}\n<<<explanation>>>: It's likely that you're trying to create the file in a directory that does not exist.
