The solution I found iterate through one iterator first, and then move on to the next one. However, what I want is when next() gets called, it first returns the first element from the first iterator. Next time when next() gets called, it returns the first element from the second iterator, and so on.Thanks\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: for(Iterator<DataSnapshot> it = dataSnapshot.getChildren().iterator(); it.hasNext(); ){\n  i = i + 1;\n    names.add(it.next().getValue(String.class));\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You're creating a new dataSnapshot.getChildren().iterator() in every iteration of your loop.
