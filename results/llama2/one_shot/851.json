The last 6 bytes in my files contain crucial information when writing the files back. I need to write my original files, and then append the last 6 bytes elsewhere. Any guidance? Thanks\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: RandomAccessFile.read\n<<<code>>>: RandomAccessFile randomAccessFile = new RandomAccessFile(your_file, \"r\");randomAccessFile.seek(your_file.length() - n);try{randomAccessFile.read(byteArray, 0, n);} catch(IOException e) {e.printStackTrace();} \n<<<explanation>>>: You have to do it by using RandomAccessFile. Instances of this class support both reading and writing to a random access file. A random access file behaves like a large array of bytes stored in the file system. \nQuestion: File truncate operation in Java: :What is the best-practice way to truncate a file in Java? For example this dummy function, just as an example to clarify the intent:void readAndTruncate(File f, List<String> lines)        throws FileNotFoundException {    for (Scanner s = new Scanner(f); s.hasNextLine(); lines.add(s.nextLine())) {}    // truncate f here! how?}The file can not be deleted since the file is acting as a place holder.\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: RandomAccessFile.read\n<<<code>>>: RandomAccessFile randomAccessFile = new RandomAccessFile(your_file, \"r\");randomAccessFile.seek(0);try{randomAccessFile.read(byteArray, 0, n);} catch(IOException e) {e.printStackTrace();} \n<<<explanation>>>: You have to do it by using RandomAccessFile.
