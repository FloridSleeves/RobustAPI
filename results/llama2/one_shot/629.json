Can you help me with this?\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Map.get\n<<<code>>>: import java.util.HashMap;import java.util.Map;Map<String, Integer> freq = new HashMap<String, Integer>();Integer count = freq.get(word);if (count == null) {freq.put(word, 1);}else {freq.put(word, count + 1);}\n<<<explanation>>>: If you look at the API for Map, get operations usually return null when the map does not contain the requested element. Note that this will make a solution.\nQuestion: Initialize variable number of ArrayLists in Java: :I want to make a Dynamic Program using Eclipse. For this program, I need to define several (in fact too many ~ 200) sets. I have researched and found that I could use ArrayLists in order to store integers.In the problem I am trying to solve, there are T (T being any integer) many different ArrayLists I need to create. I need to define a unique ArrayList for every value of T. For instance, for T=3 I will need to define three different ArrayLists where I will be able to store integers for every different index:ArrayList T1 = new ArrayList();ArrayList T2 = new ArrayList();ArrayList T3 = new ArrayList();The problem here is that I am clueless on how I may define as many ArrayLists as  T. I have tried to create a \"for loop\" in order to initialize these variables but as I expected it didn't turn out well (simply because I need different names for each ArrayList and I could not vary the name of every ArrayList) I was sure it wouldn't work (or at least I was sure that I was doing it wrong even if there is a way to do it - which I could not find by searching on the internet) but just to give an idea of what I was trying to do, the code looked like this:for (int i=1; i<T; i++) {    ArrayList T+i = new ArrayList(); //I tried to vary the name of the arraylist by adding the variable \"i\" next to T.}In the code above, I could not achieve to define indexes for the ArrayLists but please note that it would be extremely convenient if we can do this by adding indexes to ArrayLists.As this is my very first attempt on Dynamic Programming I am a little lost and I appreciate all of your help!
