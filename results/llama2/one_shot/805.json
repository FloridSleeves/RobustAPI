But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Working with files in java: :I have an array of strings.I want to save those strings in a file.The problem is, I need to make a new file called db.txt (only if it doesn't exist),then somehow write strings to it.And then later I want to be able to read strings from that file and insert them to the array.Inserting and using array is not the question, but the question is how do I mess with the files? How do I create a new text file (if not existing already), how do I write to it and how do I read from it?
