{"api": "RandomAccessFile.read", "prompt": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How do I read the last \"n\" bytes of a file in Java: How do I read the last n number of bytes from a file, without using RandomAccessFile. The last 6 bytes in my files contain crucial information when writing the files back. I need to write my original files, and then append the last 6 bytes elsewhere. Any guidance? Thanks\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: RandomAccessFile.read\n<<<code>>>: RandomAccessFile randomAccessFile = new RandomAccessFile(your_file, \"r\");randomAccessFile.seek(your_file.length() - n);try{randomAccessFile.read(byteArray, 0, n);} catch(IOException e) {e.printStackTrace();} \n<<<explanation>>>: You have to do it by using RandomAccessFile. Instances of this class support both reading and writing to a random access file. A random access file behaves like a large array of bytes stored in the file system. \nQuestion: Fast Audio File Output: :I've recently finished a small game and have been trying to add audio to it. Currently the sound system I have is working (basically the same code as the top answer here), but there is a significant stall during every output (~200-300 ms). Since it's a quick game I'm looking for something significant quicker. I'm not experienced with Threads, but would those be applicable here?\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: RandomAccessFile.write\n<<<code>>>: RandomAccessFile randomAccessFile = new RandomAccessFile(your_file, \"rw\");randomAccessFile.seek(your_file.length() - n);try{randomAccessFile.write(byteArray, 0, n);} catch(IOException e) {e.printStackTrace();} \n<<<explanation>>>: You have to do it by using RandomAccessFile.
