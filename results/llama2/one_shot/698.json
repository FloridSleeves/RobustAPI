That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: PrintWriter throwing FileNotFoundException: :I am writing a code that outputs to a text file using the PrintWriter class. However, when I try to initialize a new PrintWriter it throws a FileNotFound exception.Here are two versions of my code that both don't work, writer is initialized in the global variable as a PrintWriter.File file = new File(fileName);writer = new PrintWriter(fileName);writer.println(\"N: \" + N);writer.println(\"E: \" + E);writer.println(\"D: \" + D);writer.flush();writer.close();~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~writer = new PrintWriter(fileName);writer.println(\"N: \" + N);writer.println(\"E: \" + E);writer.println(\"D: \" + D);writer.flush();writer.close();Here is a list of the imports I'm using, am I possibly missing one?import java.text.DateFormat;import java.text.SimpleDateFormat;import java.math.*;import java.math.BigInteger;import java.util.*;import java.io.*;\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break.
