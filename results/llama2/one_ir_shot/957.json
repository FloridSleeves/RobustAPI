{"api": "String.getBytes", "prompt": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: JavaFX create file on the server side: :I have my javaFX application running on a web server (wamp) and the client access to this app by a browser. I want to create an xml file on the server side. How can i do that? Because at the moment if i use a path for example \"/Users/username/Desktop\" it will create the file on the client Desktop. I want to create this file on the server desktop. I'm using javaFX 2.2 on netbeans 7.2.1Sorry for my bad English!
