The issue is that the iterator returned by ItemCollection<QueryOutcome>::iterator is of type IteratorSupport, which is a package protected class. Therefore, it is impossible to mock the return type of this iterator. What can I do instead?Thanks!\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: Iterator<QueryOutcome> queryIterator = userNameIndex.query(\"userName\", userName);\nQueryOutcome queryOutcome = queryIterator.next();\n<<<explanation>>>: The next() method of the Iterator class returns the next element in the iteration.
