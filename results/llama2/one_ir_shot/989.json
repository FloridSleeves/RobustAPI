KeyGenerator keyGenerator = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"Blowfish\");        SecretKey secretKey = keyGenerator.generateKey();        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"Blowfish\");         cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secretKey);        String input = \"password\";        byte encrypted[] = cipher.doFinal(input.getBytes());        String s = new String(encrypted);        System.out.println(s);But what I get is `\u2510\u256bY\u00b2\u2593\u00f4\u2534Vh\u00ac\u2219:\u256a\u2321\u00b6 .
