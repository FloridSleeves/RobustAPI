This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Reading Email Addresses as Tokens: :How can I read an email address as a token?I saw that the tokenizer method has a limit of 16 bits of length, well my token is like this:command emailtest@somewhere.com 50I want to be able to store the email (can be any email address) and the number (can vary from 5-1500).  I dont care about the command token.My code looks like this:String test2 = command.substring(7);StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(test2);String email = st.nextToken();String amount = st.nextToken();\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String command = \"command emailtest@somewhere.com 50\";\nString email = StringTokenizer.nextToken(command, \" \");\nString amount = StringTokenizer.nextToken(command, \" \");\n<<<explanation>>>: The nextToken() method of the StringTokenizer class returns the next token in the string.
