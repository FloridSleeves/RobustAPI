To test my code, I have tried to hardcode the path of SD card like,File file = new File(\"/storage/632E-1AFA/Champion.mp4\");But now I want to make this app run on multiple devices. So I want a universal method to get the external SD card path. I have tried the getExternalStorageDirectory method but it points to the internal storage of the phone. The getExternalFilesDir points to your internal application files. I have also tried the System.getenv() method with the help of - Android Open External Storage directory(sdcard) for storing file and Find an external SD card location but it is returning a null path when I tried to debug the code.My app includes both the read and write permissions for external storage:<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\" /><uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\" />I am testing my app on Android 6.0, so I have included the run-time permissions as well. Please if someone could help me find a method or an approach that would get the path of an external sd card to run on multipe mobile devices, I would greatly appreciate it.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(\"sdcard/Champion.mp4\");\nString path = st.nextToken();\n<<<explanation>>>: The StringTokenizer class is used to split a string into tokens.
