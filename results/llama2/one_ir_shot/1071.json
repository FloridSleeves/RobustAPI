Here is a few lines of the text file:Mary Smith 1 James Johnson 2 Patricia Williams 3 I am trying to break up into first name, last name and Customer ID. I have so far been able to do that but it stops after mary smith. Here is my code:  public static void createCustomerList(BufferedReader infileCust,            CustomerList customerList) throws IOException{                String  firstName;            String  lastName;            int  custId;            //take first line of strings before breaking them up to first last and cust ID            String StringToBreak = infileCust.readLine();            //split up the string with string tokenizer            StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(StringToBreak);            firstName = st.nextToken();            while(st.hasMoreElements())            {            lastName =  st.nextToken();            custId = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());            CustomerElement CustomerObject = new CustomerElement();            CustomerObject.setCustInfo(firstName,lastName,custId);            customerList.addToList(CustomerObject);            }    }\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String StringToBreak = infileCust.readLine();\nStringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(StringToBreak);\nfirstName = st.nextToken();\nwhile(st.hasMoreElements())\nlastName =  st.nextToken();\ncustId = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\nCustomerElement CustomerObject = new CustomerElement();\nCustomerObject.setCustInfo(firstName,lastName,custId);\ncustomerList.addToList(CustomerObject);\n<<<explanation>>>: The nextToken() method of the StringTokenizer class returns the next token in the string.
