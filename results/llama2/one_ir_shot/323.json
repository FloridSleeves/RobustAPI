This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Calculate the number of times a value changes within a collection: :For example suppose i have a list of objectsList<Integer> integers = new ArrayList<Integer>() {            {                add(Integer.valueOf(1));                add(Integer.valueOf(1));                add(Integer.valueOf(2)); // changed                add(Integer.valueOf(2));                add(Integer.valueOf(2));                add(Integer.valueOf(3)); // changed                add(Integer.valueOf(3));                add(Integer.valueOf(1)); // changed                add(Integer.valueOf(2)); // changed            }        };The above example should return the number 4 as the value has differed from the previous number 4 times. i presently have a cumbersome and difficult to maintain way that involves looping through the item and keeping track of the previous value and an accumulator to store the number of transitions.I'm interested to see if there's a java 8 streams way to solve this problem, or a more elegant solution than simply trudging through the collection and maintaining copies of the previous value.Thanks!\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: List<Integer> integers = new ArrayList<Integer>() {            {                add(Integer.valueOf(1));                add(Integer.valueOf(1));                add(Integer.valueOf(2)); // changed                add(Integer.valueOf(2));                add(Integer.valueOf(2));                add(Integer.valueOf(3)); // changed                add(Integer.valueOf(3));                add(Integer.valueOf(1)); // changed                add(Integer.valueOf(2)); // changed            }        };\nIterator<Integer> iterator = integers.iterator();\nint count = 0;\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\n    int next = iterator.next();\n    if (next != iterator.previous()) {\n        count++;\n    }\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The next() method returns the next element in the iteration.
