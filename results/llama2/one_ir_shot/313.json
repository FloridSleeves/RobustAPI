The only way to know that the flagged elements are over, is by noticing that the (k+1)th element is not flagged.

I know I could do this:    public void methodAcceptingIterator(Iterator<String> it) //current signature   //change it to   public void methodAcceptingIterator(String firstElement, Iterator<String> it)But this looks like a workarround/hack decreasing the elegance and generality of the code, so I don't want to this.
