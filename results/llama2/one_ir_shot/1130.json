If so, please share the link as I don't find anyone yet.In my Java program, I have a String like following(String is created dynamically).String header=\"Requirements ID,Requirements Number,Requirements Desc,Requirements Text,Requirements Date\";Now I am creating a ListList<String> csv = new ArrayList<String>(); csv=Arrays.asList(header.split(\"\\\\s*,\\\\s*\")); //splittng each phrase separated by commaBut I am not getting List value in an unordered way. I mean I get the list value like this[Requirements Number,Requirements Date,Requirements Desc,Requirements ID,Requirements Text]I know list is unordered. But I want the list csv be like this[Requirements ID,Requirements Number,Requirements Desc,Requirements Text,Requirements Date]So my question is how to get this in ordered way?
