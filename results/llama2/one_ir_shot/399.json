I have the following LinkedList:List<Entry<Integer, Integer>> list = new LinkedList<Entry<Integer, Integer>>(map.entrySet());and I am trying to iterate through this list doing the following:Iterator<Entry<Integer, Integer>> iter = ((Map<Integer, Integer>) list).entrySet().iterator(); // this is problematic codeif (iter.hasNext()) {   //do some stuff}What is the proper way of doing this?
