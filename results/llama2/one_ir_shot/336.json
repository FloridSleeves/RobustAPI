I'm using them to make every class of my objects to do \"drawing\", but it takes a lot of memory so I want to cut it in half, is there a way to do for each loop not for a full list?for(Tile tile: tiles){tile.draw();}I want to:for(Tile tile: (half of)tiles){    tile.draw();}is it possible or I just need to get lenght of tiles and when it reaches the number break the loop?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: Iterator<Tile> tileIterator = tiles.iterator();\nwhile (tileIterator.hasNext()) {\nTile tile = tileIterator.next();\ntile.draw();\n<<<explanation>>>: The next() method of the Iterator class returns the next element in the iteration.
