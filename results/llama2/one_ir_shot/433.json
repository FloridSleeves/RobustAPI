This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Cycling through arrayList: :BackgroundI have a sprite (an openGL quad) which 'falls' from the top of the screen to the bottom.When it gets to the bottom of the screen, it's values get reset and it starts again (from top to bottom) but moves along in the X Axis to a new X Position.WhatI'm doing is storing the X positions in an ArrayList (there could be just 1 so it falls in the same place over and over or 10 so it moves slightly every time it falls).ProblemWhat I can't work out is how to go through this arraylist and set the sprite's new X position to the value held in the 'next' arraylist position while bearing in mind that there might not be a 'next' position.So....... (and this is Pseudo code)....once sprite has fallen and it's Y position has been reset back to the top of the screen:spriteX = value_held_in_next_arrayList_position(if_there_is_one)As different levels of my game will have a different number of positions I can't explicitly say 'go to position 2' incase the arrayList is only a size of 1.  Basically what I want is to say 'go to next position' and 'if there isn't a next position' then go back to the position 0.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<Integer>();\nlist.add(1);\nlist.add(2);\nlist.add(3);\nIterator<Integer> it = list.iterator();\nwhile (it.hasNext()) {\nint next = it.next();\n<<<explanation>>>: The next() method returns the next element in the iteration.
