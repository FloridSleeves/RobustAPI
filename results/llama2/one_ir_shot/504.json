I want to get another array that gives me the ranking of the players based on their scores.For example: Given the scores {10,20,15,40}I want the ranking to be {4,2,3,1}The lowest score being rank 4 and the highest score being rank 1.The biggest problem is when there are multiple players with the same score. For example {10,10,20,40} then I want to get {34,34,2,1} (34 because the third and fourth place are shared by two players)Another example is {40,40,10,20}, which should give the ranking {12,12,4,3} (12 for shared first and second place)I have for the moment two dubble arrays to come to that result, but I think it can be better, but I don't find how. My biggest problem now is when we have 3 same scores: {40,40,40,10} than I should have the result {123,123,123,4}I hope you understand my question and of course can help me to find a solution.thanks\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {10,20,15,40};\nint[] ranking = new int[array.length];\nint i = 0;\nfor (int j = 0; j < array.length; j++) {\nif (array[j] == array[i]) {\nranking[i] = ranking[i] + 1;\nranking[i] = array[i];\ni = i + 1;\nfor (int k = 0; k < array.length; k++) {\nSystem.out.println(ranking[k]);\n<<<explanation>>>: The next() method returns the next element in the iteration.
