Is regex the only solution?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String s=\"social network such as '''[http://www.facebook.com Facebook]''' , \"+\"'''[http://www.twitter.com Twitter]''' and '''[http://www.tumblr.com tumblr]'''\";\nStringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(s, \"'''[\");\nwhile (st.hasMoreTokens()) {\nSystem.out.println(st.nextToken());\n<<<explanation>>>: The StringTokenizer class is used to split a string into tokens.
