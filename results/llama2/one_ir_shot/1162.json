Have read a txt file with a buffer reader and trying to use a StringTokenizer.The string i have it like this, where some text first and some numbers after. I only need to numbers, and want to skip \"Text\".Test 2 5 1My code:// Check if the graph contains an cycle    StringTokenizer st1 = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());    Graph.checkForCycle(null, Integer.parseInt(st1.()), Integer.parseInt(st1.nextToken()), Integer.parseInt(st1.nextToken()));      As you can see there are 4 sets here and i want the last 3 to be send with the paramenter when i call the method Graph.checkForCycle()Hope someone can help.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: StringTokenizer st1 = new StringTokenizer(\"Test 2 5 1\");\nint[] numbers = new int[3];\nnumbers[0] = Integer.parseInt(st1.nextToken());\nnumbers[1] = Integer.parseInt(st1.nextToken());\nnumbers[2] = Integer.parseInt(st1.nextToken());\n<<<explanation>>>: The nextToken() method of the StringTokenizer class returns the next token in the string.
