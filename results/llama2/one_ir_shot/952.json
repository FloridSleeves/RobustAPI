created!This is the code:     private void OpenMenuActionPerformed(java.awt.event.ActionEvent evt) {                                             ModFile=new File(NameText.getText() + \".mod\");    FileWriter writer = null;    try {        writer = new FileWriter(ModFile);    } catch (IOException ex) {        Logger.getLogger(ModMakerGui.class.getName()).log(Level.SEVERE, null, ex);    }   if(!ModFile.exists()){   try {   ModFile.createNewFile();   System.out.println(\"Mod file has been created to the current directory\");   writer.write(CodesBox.getText());   } catch (IOException ex) {   Logger.getLogger(ModMakerGui.class.getName()).log(Level.SEVERE, null, ex);       }     }        }                      When i create a random file, i don't see any thing when i open it!Please helpThanks Amir for helping but i noticed i should use FileOutputStream and DataOutputStream...So, i need help again cause the same problem appeared :( File ModFile =new File(NameText.getText() + \".mod\");try {    FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(ModFile);    DataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(fos);    int i = Integer.parseInt(CodesBox.getText());    dos.writeInt(i);        // and other processing } catch (IOException ex) {    Logger.getLogger(ModMakerGui.class.getName()).log(Level.SEVERE, null, ex);}finally{    try{         dos.close();    } catch(IOException e) {        e.printStackTrace();    }}NetBeans said they cannot find the symbol dos at (dos.close();)Please help me here again\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>:
