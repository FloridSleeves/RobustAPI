I am using Hibernate (to which I am relatively new) on top of oracle database.I was thinking in lines of locking student1 row and returning that row, but I am not very conversant with locking in hibernate.On Client Side time t1: getStudentInfo() (work on student1) |  getStudentInfo() //Call concurrently (work on student2)time t1+10sec: getStudentInfo (work on student3)time t1+20sec: getStudentInfo (work on student4)First call should be able to work on student1 and second concurrent call should be able to work on student2.Edit: Made changes based on comments. ( I cannot edit the query and clients getStudentInfo cannot pass the id if that helps).\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: List<StudentObj> stObj = StudentDAO.getRows();\nIterator<StudentObj> it = stObj.iterator();\nwhile (it.hasNext()) {\nStudentObj s = it.next();\n<<<explanation>>>: The next() method of the Iterator class returns the next element in the iteration.
