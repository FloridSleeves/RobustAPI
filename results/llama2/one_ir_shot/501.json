This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Why for-each loop does not allow increment Integer?: :I mean in this code:List<Integer> list = new LinkedList();list.add(1);list.add(2);list.add(3);for (Integer i : list)    i++;System.out.println(list.get(0))returns 1 not 2. In for-each loop Java creates new object (i) and copies fields value from object in List?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: List<Integer> list = new LinkedList();list.add(1);list.add(2);list.add(3);Iterator<Integer> it = list.iterator();while (it.hasNext()) {Integer i = it.next();System.out.println(i);}\n<<<explanation>>>: The next() method returns the next element in the iteration.
