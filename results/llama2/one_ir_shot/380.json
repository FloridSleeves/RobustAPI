{"api": "Iterator.next", "prompt": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Are unmodifiableMaps fail fast: :Is Map returned from Collections.unmodifiableMap Fail-Fast. In other words does it throw concurrentModificationException while iterating if somebody else modifies the map with a \"modifiable view\" of the map\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: Map<String, String> map = new HashMap<>();\nmap.put(\"key1\", \"value1\");\nmap.put(\"key2\", \"value2\");\nIterator<String> it = Collections.unmodifiableMap(map).keySet().iterator();\n<<<explanation>>>: The unmodifiableMap() method returns a view of the map that cannot be modified.
