bytes: Number of files in the archiveNext 4 bytes: Number of bytes in the filenameNext N bytes: FilenameNext 10 bytes: Number of bytes in the fileNext N bytes: File contentsfrom PHP Safe way to download mutliple files and save them.I am having on trouble with finding the values of the number of files etc. but I don't know how to expand an integer into 4 bytes.Is it similar to this- How do I
