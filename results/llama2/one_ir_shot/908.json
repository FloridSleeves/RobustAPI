I can't do this manually as there are well over 5000 files.How can I make it delete this specific line in all of the files?\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: String.getBytes\n<<<code>>>: String read = \"char-15\";\nFile dir = new File(\"chars\");\nif(dir.exists()) {\nString read;\nFile files[] = dir.listFiles();\nfor (int j = 0; j < files.length; j++) {\nFile loaded = files[j];\nif (loaded.getName().endsWith(\".txt\")) {\nScanner s = new Scanner (loaded);\nwhile (s.hasNextLine()) {\nread = s.nextLine();\nif (read.contains(\"char-15\")) {\nread.replace(read, \"\");\nSystem.out.println(loaded.getName() +\" - Data: \"+read);\nbreak;                                                      }\n}                                       }\n}            }\ncatch (Exception e) {\n}    }\nQuestion: How can I get the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.
