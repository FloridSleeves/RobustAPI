What would be the most efficient way of accomplishing this task?UPDATE.As you can see the desired order is not alphabetical, that includes reverse. As I mentioned the objective is to group the strings and order them by first appearance. For this example I am using letter to simplify a (lot) more complex problem I am trying to solve.
