This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Is there a faster way to convert data to a byte and then back into its original form?: :I am using a queue service that only takes messages as byte so I need to convert my data quickly to the format and then make it back to its original when I receive work from the queue.  My data format is a INT, DOUBLE, and INT[] and here's how I did it at first//to convert to stringString[] message = { Integer.toString(number), String.valueOf(double), Arrays.toString(my_list) };message.asString;//to convert backString message_without_brackets = message.replace(\"[\", \"\" ).replace(\"]\", \"\");String[] temp_message = message_without_brackets.split(\",\"); int interger = Integer.valueOf(temp_message[0]);double double = Double.valueOf(temp_message[1]);int[] my_list = new int[temp_message.length-2]; //-2 because the first two entries are other datafor (int i = 2; i < temp_message.length; i++) {    my_list[i-2] = Integer.parseInt(temp_message[i].replace(\" \",\"\"));}This is super ugly and it annoyed me that after a few weeks(or a single night of heavy drinking) I would probably not be able to figure out this quickly.  Performance wise the code wasn't too bad, I think replace was the heaviest part of the code(if I remember it was like 15% of overall execution).I asked around and found Gson to be able to do this cleaner but the performance is now over 40% of my loop now(its Gson itself thats doing it):    Gson gson = new Gson();    int[] sub = { 0, 59, 16 };    Object[] values = { 0, 43.0, sub };    String output = gson.toJson(values); // => [0, 43.0,[0,59,16]]    Object[] deserialized = gson.fromJson(output, Object[].class);    System.out.println(deserialized[0]);    System.out.println(deserialized[1]);    System.out.println(deserialized[2]);So I'm wondering if there's faster way to get the same result?I am trying out a few of the suggestions in this question but is there a faster way to do this without depending on any external libraries as my needs are quite simple(if not, then is there a fast one)?  Because someone suggested Gson, I looked at Json parsers, but is that what I should be looking for or is are there other types of libraries that do this?EDIT: I am converting it to string because I thought I needed to do that to send it as getBytes(), is there any other format that would be faster that I can use getBytes() on?\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: DataOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>: DataOutputStream out = new DataOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(\"test.txt\"));\nout.writeInt(1);\nout.writeInt(2);\nout.writeInt(3);\nout.writeInt(4);\nout.writeInt(5);\nout.writeInt(6);\nout.writeInt(7);\nout.writeInt(8);\nout.writeInt(9);\nout.writeInt(10);\nout.writeInt(11);\nout.writeInt(12);\nout.writeInt(13);\nout.writeInt(14);\nout.writeInt(15);\nout.writeInt(16);\nout.writeInt(17);\nout.writeInt(18);\nout.writeInt(19);\nout.writeInt(20);\nout.writeInt(21);\nout.writeInt(22);\nout.writeInt(23);\nout.writeInt(24);\nout.writeInt(25);\nout.writeInt(26);\nout.writeInt(27);\nout.writeInt(28);\nout.writeInt(29);\nout.writeInt(30);\nout.writeInt(31);\nout.writeInt(32);\nout.writeInt(33);\nout.writeInt(34);\nout.writeInt(35);\nout.writeInt(36);\nout.writeInt(37);\nout.writeInt(38);\nout.writeInt(39);\nout.writeInt(40);\nout.writeInt(41);\nout.writeInt(42);\nout.writeInt(43);\nout.writeInt(44);\nout.writeInt(45);\nout.writeInt(46);\nout.writeInt(47);\nout.writeInt(48);\nout.writeInt(49);\nout.writeInt(50);\nout.writeInt(51);\nout.writeInt(52);\nout.writeInt(53);\nout.writeInt(54);\nout.writeInt(55);\nout.writeInt(56);\nout.writeInt(57);\nout.writeInt(58);\nout.writeInt(59);\nout.writeInt(60);\nout.writeInt(61);\nout.writeInt(62);\nout.writeInt(63);\nout.writeInt(64);\nout.writeInt(65);\nout.writeInt(66);\nout.writeInt(67);\nout.writeInt(68);\nout.writeInt(69);\nout.writeInt(70);\nout.writeInt(71);\nout.writeInt(72);\nout.writeInt(73);\nout.writeInt(74);\nout.writeInt(75);\nout.writeInt(76);\nout.writeInt(77);\nout.writeInt(78);\nout.writeInt(79);\nout.writeInt(80);\nout.writeInt(81);\nout.writeInt(82);\nout.writeInt(83);\nout.writeInt(84);\nout.writeInt(85);\nout.writeInt(86);\nout.writeInt(87);\nout.writeInt(88);\nout.writeInt(89);\nout.writeInt(90);\nout.writeInt(91);\nout.writeInt(92);\nout.writeInt(93);\nout.writeInt(94);\nout.writeInt(95);\nout.writeInt(96);\nout.writeInt(97);\nout.writeInt(98);\nout.writeInt(99);\nout.writeInt(100);\nout.writeInt(101);\nout.writeInt(102);\nout.writeInt(103);\nout.writeInt(104);\nout.writeInt(105);\nout.writeInt(106);\nout.writeInt(107);\nout.writeInt(108);\nout.writeInt(109);\nout.writeInt(110);\nout.writeInt(111);\nout.writeInt(112);\nout.writeInt(113);\nout.writeInt(114);\nout.writeInt(115);\nout.writeInt(116);\nout.writeInt(117);\nout.writeInt(118);\nout.writeInt(119);\nout.writeInt(120);\nout.writeInt(121);\nout.writeInt(122);\nout.writeInt(123);\nout.writeInt(124);\nout.writeInt(125);\nout.write"}
