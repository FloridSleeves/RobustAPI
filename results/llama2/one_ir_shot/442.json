I want to set key as value if condition gets matched by using key/value pair from mapdouble percent = r.nextDouble()*100;if(percent > 1.0 && percent < 70.0(how can I use 70 from testMap instead of hardcoding)) {//what to put below in place of Previous    commands.get(commandWithMaxNegativeOffset).setDataCriteria(Use the Key of 70.0 i.e Previous);} else if(percent > 71 && percent < 100){    commands.get(commandWithMaxNegativeOffset).setDataCriteria(Use the Key of 30.0 i.e New);}\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: LinkedHashMap<String, Double> testMap = (LinkedHashMap<String, Double>) sortByValue(commands.get(commandWithMaxNegativeOffset).getDataUsageCriteria());\nIterator<Map.Entry<String, Double>> it = testMap.entrySet().iterator();\nwhile (it.hasNext()) {\nMap.Entry<String, Double> entry = it.next();\nif (percent > 1.0 && percent < 70.0) {\ncommands.get(commandWithMaxNegativeOffset).setDataCriteria(entry.getValue());\nelse if (percent > 71 && percent < 100) {\ncommands.get(commandWithMaxNegativeOffset).setDataCriteria(entry.getKey());\nQuestion: How can I get the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.
