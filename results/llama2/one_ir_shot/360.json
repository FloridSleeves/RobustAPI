{"api": "Iterator.next", "prompt": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Map.Entry m = (Map.Entry)i.next();: :Why do I need to have (Map.Entry) in front of the i.next(); ? Why can't I have just Map.Entry m = i.next();?Sorry. It is a HashMap.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: HashMap<String, String> map = new HashMap<>();\nmap.put(\"key1\", \"value1\");\nmap.put(\"key2\", \"value2\");\nIterator<Map.Entry<String, String>> iterator = map.entrySet().iterator();\nMap.Entry<String, String> entry = iterator.next();\n<<<explanation>>>: The next() method returns the next element in the iteration.
