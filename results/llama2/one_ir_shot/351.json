This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Java: :I have to implement Priority Queue using MultiMap. I use MultiMap from Google Collections. The following code creates a MultiMap and adds few elements into it.     Multimap<Integer, String> multimap = HashMultimap.create();    multimap.put(5,\"example\");    multimap.put(1,\"is\");    multimap.put(1,\"this\");    multimap.put(4,\"some\");Now my problem is how to write the pop method? I think that there should be a for loop and it should be iterating through MultiMap. The lowest key should be the highest priority, so in C++ I would set a pointer to the first element and increment it.
