I am defining the linked hash map as follows... LinkedHashMap<String, String> sections; sections = new LinkedHashMap();Then, I have collected lines of text from a pdf. If certain conditions are met, II split the text on a white space putting the numerical value \"#######\" as the key and the rest of the line as the value... if (tocStartFound == true && tocEndFound == false) {     if (line.matches(\"\\\\d{6}.+\")){     String lineSplit[] = line.split(\"\\\\s\",2);     sections.put(lineSplit[0], lineSplit[1]); }Now, when i ask if line.contains(nextSection) I am told an \"object cannot be converted to a charSequence.\"if (sectionStarted == true){    Set set = sections.entrySet();    Iterator iter = set.iterator();    boolean foundName = false;    Object nextSection;    while(iter.hasNext()){        Map.Entry me = (Map.Entry)iter.next();        if (foundName == true){            nextSection = me.getValue();            nextSection = nextSection.toString();            break;        }        if (sectionName == me.getValue()) {            foundName = true;        }}Pattern pa = Pattern.compile(\".+((?i)end of section).+\");Matcher ma = pa.matcher(line);if (ma.find() || line.contains(nextSection)){    System.out.println(\"End of Section\");    sectionStarted = false;}I guess I thought by defining the map with <string,string>, i was enduring that the data would be typed as strings.
