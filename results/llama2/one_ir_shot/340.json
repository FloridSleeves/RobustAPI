{"api": "Iterator.next", "prompt": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Last iteration of enhanced for loop in java: :Is there a way to determine if the loop is iterating for the last time. My code looks something like this:int[] array = {1, 2, 3...};StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();for(int i : array){    builder.append(\"\" + i);    if(!lastiteration)        builder.append(\",\");}Now the thing is I don't want to append the comma in the last iteration. Now is there a way to determine if it is the last iteration or am I stuck with the for loop or using an external counter to keep track.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nIterator<Integer> it = Arrays.asList(array).iterator();\nwhile(it.hasNext()){\n    System.out.println(it.next());\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The next() method of the Iterator class returns the next element in the iteration.
