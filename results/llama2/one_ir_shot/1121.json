For example, let's say I wanted my array to read a series of words until it reached the word \"okay\" from std in, print out each word, and then terminate before printing out \"okay\". The length of this array will be unknown, so I am confused on how to do this.     String s  = sc.next();     String[] copy = new String[???];     for( int i = 0; i < copy.length; i++ ){           copy[i] = sc.next();          }\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String s = sc.next();\nString[] copy = new String[s.length()];\nfor( int i = 0; i < copy.length; i++ ){\ncopy[i] = s.substring(i, i + 1);\n<<<explanation>>>: The StringTokenizer class is used to split a string into tokens.
