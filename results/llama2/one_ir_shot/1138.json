This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to read a textfile containing a comma separated list and store each word that is separated by a comma into a separate array: :Hello I am trying to figure out how I would read a line in a comma separated text file and store each word that is separated by a comma in the file into a separate array. For example if the line in the file wasDog, blue, largeThen I would like to have 3 different arrays that store one word from the list. So would array 1 would store Dog, array 2 stores blue, and array 3 stores large.Thanks \nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(\"Dog, blue, large\");\nString[] array = st.nextToken().split(\",\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The StringTokenizer class is used to split a string into tokens.
