{"api": "StringTokenizer.nextToken", "prompt": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Java: How to read a text file: :I want to read a text file containing space separated values. Values are integers.How can I read it and put it in an array list?Here is an example of contents of the text file:1 62 4 55 5 6 77I want to have it in an arraylist as [1, 62, 4, 55, 5, 6, 77]. How can I do it in Java?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(\"1 62 4 55 5 6 77\");\nint[] array = new int[st.countTokens()];\nfor (int i = 0; i < st.countTokens(); i++) {\narray[i] = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\n<<<explanation>>>: The StringTokenizer class is used to split a string into tokens. The nextToken() method returns the next token in the string.
