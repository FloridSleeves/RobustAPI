I have initialized the hashmap with keys from 0-51 and the values are array of Card, as followsCard [] card = new Card[52]for (int i=1; i<=13; i++)    for (int j=0; j<4; j++)        card[++index] = new Card( ((i*10)+j) );and I populate the hashmap as follows:for (int i=1; i<=13; i++)    for (int j=0; j<4; j++)        deck.put( ++key, card[++index] );Now, what I want to do is to shuffle the values side of the hashmap, i do not want,for an example, the key[1] corresponds to card[0] and key[1] corresponds to card[1]. I want, for an exampel, the key[1] corresponds to card[38]. I want the values side to be shuffled.
