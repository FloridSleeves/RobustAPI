I need to gather the entire column and store it, and no other values. I've attempted to check for blank, null, 0, \"\", and CELL_TYPE_BLANK (int = 3), and I cannot get it to avoid a null pointer exception. Code snippet and error are below. What can I do? This is not the entire method or program, just the relevant piece.String s = list[i];//find the directory from the list array to locate the fileInputStream input = new FileInputStream(s);//create a new workbook object to hold the excel fileWorkbook wb = new XSSFWorkbook(input);//create an arbitrary starting locationint column = 2; //absolutely the correct numberint rownum = 10;//get the value from the first sheetorg.apache.poi.ss.usermodel.Sheet insheet = wb.getSheetAt(0);       //of the second colummRow row = insheet.getRow(rownum);//in the 11th row (arbitrary number used to reduce iterations and skip whitespace)Cell cell = row.getCell(column); System.out.println(\"Skimming sheet: \" + insheet.getSheetName());//iterate until the very end of the column is foundSystem.out.println(\"Cell value B\" + (rownum-1) +  \": \" + cell);//3 denotes CELL_TYPE_BLANKwhile (cell.getCellType() != 3 ) {    //go to the next location    //update to the next cell    System.out.println(\"Cell value B\" + rownum +  \": \" + cell);    row = insheet.getRow(rownum);    if(row.getCell(column).getCellType() != 3){        cell = row.getCell(column); //error occurs here, line 241    }    rownum++;}Exception in thread \"main\" java.lang.NullPointerException    at FileTest.skim(FileTest.java:241)    at FileTest.main(FileTest.java:121)\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nIterator<Integer> it = Arrays.stream(array).iterator();\nwhile (it.hasNext()) {\nSystem.out.println(it.next());\n<<<explanation>>>: The next() method of the Iterator class returns the next element in the iteration.
