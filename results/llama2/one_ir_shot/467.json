This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Different ways of using recursion in Java: :I'm thinking of several elegant ways of writing a simple Lisp-like recursive function in Java that does, let's say, a simple summation.In Common Lisp it would be like this:(defun summation(l)    (if l        (+ (car l) (summation (cdr l)))        0))(summation '(1 2 3 4 5)) ==> 15In Java the one of many possible solutions would be:public int summation(int[] array, int n) {    return (n == 0)            ? array[0]            : array[n] + summation(array, n - 1);}CALL: summation(new int[]{1,2,3,4,5}, 4); //151) Is there any possible way NOT to use the index n? 2) Or leave your solution (non-iterational) which you see as interesting.
