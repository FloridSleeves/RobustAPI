I need a specific file .Below is the code usedFile[] listOfFiles = folder.listFiles();for (File file : listOfFiles){if (file.isFile()&&(file.getName().substring(file.getName().lastIndexOf('.')+1).equals(\"xlsx\"))){ Workbook workbook =WorkbookFactory.create(file.getAbsoluteFile());                       Sheet sheet = workbook.getSheetAt(0);                       int j = sheet.getLastRowNum();                       System.out.println(j);    }   }  I am getting output as 340 which is the sum of all values in all files in the folder.But for 1st sheet it should be 40.
