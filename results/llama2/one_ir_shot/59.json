This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Read file and get key=value without using java.util.Properties: :I'm building a RMI game and the client would load a file that has some keys and values which are going to be used on several different objects. It is a save game file but I can't use java.util.Properties for this (it is under the specification). I have to read the entire file and ignore commented lines and the keys that are not relevant in some classes. These properties are unique but they may be sorted in any order. My file current file looks like this:# BioplayerOrigin=NewlandsplayerClass=Warlock# ArmorplayerHelmet=emptyplayerUpperArmor=armor900playerBottomArmor=armor457playerBoots=boot109etcThese properties are going to be written and placed according to the player's progress and the filereader would have to reach the end of file and get only the matched keys. I've tried different approaches but so far nothing came close to the results that I would had using java.util.Properties.
