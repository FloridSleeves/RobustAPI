These are the instructions:Write a class called SpecialToken that has a static method called thirdToken. Thismethod should return as a String, the third token of a String that you pass as a parameter. You may assume that spaces will serve as delimiters.This is what I have so far but honestly I am stumped at what the parameter should be and how to return the third token!
