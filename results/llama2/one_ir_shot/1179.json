The format of the string (which come from a dataset) is as so (the -> represents a tab, and the * represents a space):Date(yyyymmdd)->Date(yyyymmdd)->*City,*State*-->DescriptionI am only interested in the 1st date and the State. I tried regex like this:String txt=\"19951010    19951011     Red City, WI                 Description\";    String re1=\"(\\\\d+)\";    // Integer Number 1    String re2=\".*?\";   // Non-greedy match on filler    String re3=\"(?:[a-z][a-z]+)\";   // Uninteresting: word    String re4=\".*?\";   // Non-greedy match on filler    String re5=\"(?:[a-z][a-z]+)\";   // Uninteresting: word    String re6=\".*?\";   // Non-greedy match on filler    String re7=\"((?:[a-z][a-z]+))\"; // Word 1    Pattern p = Pattern.compile(re1+re2+re3+re4+re5+re6+re7,Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE | Pattern.DOTALL);    Matcher m = p.matcher(txt);    if (m.find())    {        String int1=m.group(1);        String word1=m.group(2);        System.out.print(\"(\"+int1.toString()+\")\"+\"(\"+word1.toString()+\")\"+\"\\n\");    }It works fine id the city has two words (Red City) then the State is extracted properly, but if the City only has one word it does not work. I can't figure it out, I don't need to use regex and am open to any other suggestions.
