My professor send us a JUnit test so we can know if our code is working correctly. Now every method has passed the test except the iterator test which fails the test. It appears to be a java.lang.AssertionError and I cant seem to figure out a way of fixing it. If you could see the error and point it out to me would be awesome. Thanks in advance\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: ArrayList<Contact> contacts = new ArrayList<>();\ncontacts.add(new Contact(\"John\", \"Doe\"));\ncontacts.add(new Contact(\"Jane\", \"Doe\"));\ncontacts.add(new Contact(\"Joe\", \"Doe\"));\nIterator<Contact> it = contacts.iterator();\nwhile (it.hasNext()) {\nSystem.out.println(it.next().getName());\n<<<explanation>>>: The next() method returns the next element in the iteration.
