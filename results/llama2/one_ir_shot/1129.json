{"api": "StringTokenizer.nextToken", "prompt": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Trim string after newline: :My string is say :str1=\"ashdef\";I want to remove anything after the newline so my desired string would be only \"ash\".How do I do this, One thing could be I could trim this and then substring it . Any other ways which I can do this.Thanks \nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:", "response": "<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: String str1 = \"ashdef\";\nString str2 = str1.trim();\nString str3 = str2.substring(0, str2.indexOf(\"\\n\"));\n<<<explanation>>>: The StringTokenizer class is used to split a string into tokens. The nextToken() method returns the next token in the string.
