It inputs a file of a list of countries that is sorted alphabetically, it outputs an unsorted file with lines rearranged randomly.My first main class looks like this:package assignment3;import java.io.PrintWriter;import java.io.File;import java.util.Scanner;public class Assignment3 {`public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception{    Scanner stdIn = new Scanner(new File(\"C:/Users/Vicki/Desktop/CountrySortedFormat.txt\"));    PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(\"C:/Users/Vicki/Desktop/CountryUnsortedFormat.txt\");    String[] line = new String[238];    while (stdIn.hasNextLine()){            for (int k = 0; k <= line.length-1; k++){            line[k]=stdIn.nextLine();            out.println(line[k]);            out.close();        }    }  }}My code doesn't have any visible problems but I tried printing out the array and got an array of \"null\".
