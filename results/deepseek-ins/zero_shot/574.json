This method returns the next element in the iterator, which in your case is the class name of the servlet, not the ImageWriter instance you need. \n\nTo resolve this, you should directly use the `ImageIO.getImageWritersByMIMEType(\"image/jpeg\")` method to get an `ImageWriter` instance. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```java\nIterator<ImageWriter> iter = ImageIO.getImageWritersByMIMEType(\"image/jpeg\");\nImageWriter writer = iter.next();\n```\n\nBy using `ImageIO.getImageWritersByMIMEType(\"image/jpeg\")`, you're ensuring that you're getting the `ImageWriter` instance you need, which should allow you to set the filename in the Content-Disposition header correctly.\n\nAlso, ensure that you're disposing the writer properly after you're done with it to free up resources. You can do this by calling `writer.dispose()` after you've written the image.\n\nI hope this helps resolve your issue. If you have any further questions, feel free to ask.\n\nNote: If you're using Java 9 or later, you might encounter issues with the ImageIO class. In such cases, you might need to use the ImageIO.createImageWriters() method instead.\n\n```java\nImageWriter writer = ImageIO.createImageWritersByMIMEType(\"image/jpeg\").next();\n```\n\nThis should provide you with the ImageWriter instance you need.\n\nI hope this helps resolve your issue.
