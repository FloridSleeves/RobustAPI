Since the map is sorted, this will be the only key. We can then use this key to get the corresponding value from the map. This is a very efficient way to access the key and value of a map with only one entry.\n\nA: If you are sure that the map will always have exactly one entry, you can use the following code:\nMap.Entry<A, B> entry = map.entrySet().iterator().next();\nA key = entry.getKey();\nB value = entry.getValue();\n\nThis code assumes that the map is not empty. If the map could be empty, you should check if it is empty before calling this code.\n\nA: You can use the following code:\nA key = map.keySet().iterator().next();\nB value = map.get(key);\n\nThis code assumes that the map is not empty.
