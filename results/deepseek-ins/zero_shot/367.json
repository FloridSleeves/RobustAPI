This means that only the last song in your database will be played. To fix this, you should create a single MediaPlayer and MediaView for all songs. Here is the corrected code:\n\n```java\npublic class FX_Musicplayer extends Application {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        launch(args);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void start(final Stage stage) throws Exception {\n        final ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();\n        try {\n            Statement stmt = null;\n            // connect to database radio\n            Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(\"jdbc:mysql://localhost/radio\", \"root\", \"\");\n            stmt = conn.createStatement();\n            String sql = \"SELECT location FROM Request\";\n            ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(sql);\n            while (rs.next()) {\n                list.add(rs.getString(1));\n            }\n        } catch (SQLException e1) {\n            e1.printStackTrace();\n        }\n\n        final Group root = new Group();\n        final MediaPlayer player = new MediaPlayer(new Media(list.get(0)));\n        MediaView view = new MediaView(player);\n        root.getChildren().add(view);\n        Scene scene = new Scene(root, 400, 400, Color.BLACK);\n        stage.setScene(scene);\n        stage.show();\n\n        player.play();\n        player.setOnEndOfMedia(new Runnable() {\n            @Override\n            public void run() {\n                if (list.size() > 1) {\n                    list.remove(0);\n                    player.stop();\n                    player.dispose();\n                    player.setMedia(new Media(list.get(0)));\n                    player.play();\n                }\n            }\n        });\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, I've created a single MediaPlayer and MediaView for all songs in the database. I've also added a Runnable to the MediaPlayer's onEndOfMedia property that will remove the first song from the list, stop the player, dispose of the player, create a new player with the next song in the list, and start playing the new song. This will allow the songs to play one after the other.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that all songs in the database are valid and can be played by the MediaPlayer. If there are any invalid songs, the code will throw an exception when it tries to create a Media object for that song.\n\nAlso, please make sure to replace the database connection details with your own.\n\nThis code will play the first song, then the second song, and so on, until there are no more songs in the database. If you want to play the songs in a different order, you can modify the list before starting the player.\n\nI hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n"}
