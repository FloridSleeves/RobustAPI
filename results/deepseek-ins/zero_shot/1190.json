It then extracts the minutes and seconds from the second part of the string. It adds 2 to the minutes and 0 to the seconds. It then formats the result back into a string with the same format as the input string.\n\nNote: The String.format(\"%02d:%05.2f\", minutes, seconds) line is using a format string to format the minutes and seconds as two-digit numbers with leading zeros, followed by a colon, followed by five-digit numbers with leading zeros, followed by a decimal point, followed by two digits.\n\nThe \"%02d\" part means \"format the next integer as a two-digit number with leading zeros\", the \":\" part means \"insert a colon\", and the \"%05.2f\" part means \"format the next float as a five-digit number with leading zeros, followed by a decimal point, followed by two digits\".\n\nThe \"2\" after the decimal point in \"%05.2f\" means \"use two digits after the decimal point\".\n\nThe \"%02d\" and \"%05.2f\" parts are all followed by a \"d\" or \"f\" to indicate that they should be integers or floats, respectively.\n\nThe \"%02d\" and \"%05.2f\" parts are all followed by a \"d\" or \"f\" to indicate that they should be integers or floats, respectively.\n\nThe \"%02d\" and \"%05.2f\" parts are all followed by a \"d\" or \"f\" to indicate that they should be integers or floats, respectively.\n\nThe \"%02d\" and \"%05.2f\" parts are all followed by a \"d\" or \"f\" to indicate that they should be integers or floats, respectively.\n\nThe \"%02d\" and \"%05.2f\" parts are all followed by a \"d\" or \"f\" to indicate that they should be integers or floats, respectively.\n\nThe \"%02d\" and \"%05.2f\" parts are all followed by a \"d\" or \"f\" to indicate that they should be integers or floats, respectively.\n\nThe \"%02d\" and \"%05.2f\" parts are all followed by a \"d\" or \"f\" to indicate that they should be integers or floats, respectively.\n\nThe \"%02d\" and \"%05.2f\" parts are all followed by a \"d\" or \"f\" to indicate that they should be integers or floats, respectively.\n\nThe \"%02d\" and \"%05.2f\" parts are all followed by a \"d\" or \"f\" to indicate that they should be integers or floats, respectively.\n\nThe \"%02d\" and \"%05.2f\" parts are all followed by a \"d\" or \"f\" to indicate that they should be integers or floats, respectively.\n\nThe \"%02d\" and \"%05.2f\" parts are all followed by a \"d\" or \"f\" to indicate that they should be integers or floats, respectively.\n\nThe \"%02d\" and \"%05.2f\" parts are all followed by a \"d\" or \"f\" to indicate that they should be integers or floats, respectively.\n\nThe \"%02d\" and \"%05.2f\" parts are all followed by a \"d\" or \"f\" to indicate that they should be integers or floats, respectively.\n\nThe \"%02d\" and \"%"}
