The DiskFileItemFactory is a simple implementation that uses a disk-based temporary directory to store data.\n\nAPI: ServletFileUpload\nCODE: ServletFileUpload upload = new ServletFileUpload(fileItemFactory);\nEXPLANATION: This is the main class that handles the file upload. It uses the FileItemFactory to create FileItem objects.\n\nAPI: FileItem\nCODE: FileItem fileItem = upload.parseRequest(request).get(0);\nEXPLANATION: This line of code parses the request and gets the first file item. The file item represents the uploaded file.\n\nAPI: String\nCODE: String fileName = fileItem.getName();\nEXPLANATION: This line of code gets the name of the file.\n\nAPI: String\nCODE: String fileExtension = FilenameUtils.getExtension(fileName);\nEXPLANATION: This line of code gets the file extension of the file. It uses the FilenameUtils class from the Apache Commons IO library.\n\nAPI: File\nCODE: File file = new File(\"path/to/directory\", fileName);\nEXPLANATION: This line of code creates a new File object representing the file in the specified directory.\n\nAPI: FileOutputStream\nCODE: FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(file);\nEXPLANATION: This line of code creates a new FileOutputStream to write the file data to the specified file.\n\nAPI: PrintWriter\nCODE: PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(fos);\nEXPLANATION: This line of code creates a new PrintWriter to write text to the specified output stream. In this case, it's the FileOutputStream that writes to the file.\n\nAPI: FileItemInputStream\nCODE: FileItemInputStream fis = fileItem.getInputStream();\nEXPLANATION: This line of code gets the input stream of the file item. This is the stream that contains the uploaded file data.\n\nAPI: IOUtils\nCODE: IOUtils.copy(fis, writer);\nEXPLANATION: This line of code copies the data from the input stream to the PrintWriter. This effectively writes the file data to the file. The IOUtils class from the Apache Commons IO library is used for this.\n\nAPI: PrintWriter\nCODE: writer.close();\nEXPLANATION: This line of code closes the PrintWriter. It's good practice to close resources when you're done with them to free up system resources.\n\nAPI: FileOutputStream\nCODE: fos.close();\nEXPLANATION: This line of code closes the FileOutputStream. It's good practice to close resources when you're done with them to free up system resources.\n\nAPI: File\nCODE: file.delete();\nEXPLANATION: This line of code deletes the file. This is useful if you want to clean up the temporary files that are created during the upload process.\n\nAPI: File\nCODE: file.deleteOnExit();\nEXPLANATION: This line of code schedules the file for deletion when the virtual machine shuts down. This is useful if you want to clean up the temporary files that are created during the upload process.\n\nAPI: File\nCODE: File tempFile = File.createTempFile(\"prefix\", \".suffix\");\nEXPLANATION: This line of code creates a new temporary file in the default temporary-file directory with a unique name. The prefix and suffix are used to name the file.\n\nAPI: File\nCODE: File tempDir = File.createTempFile(\"prefix\", \".suffix\");\nEXPLANATION: This line of code creates a new temporary directory in the default temporary-file directory with a unique name. The prefix and suffix are used to name the directory.\n\nAPI: File\nCODE: File tempFile = File.createTempFile(\"prefix\", \".suffix\", tempDir);\nEXPLANATION: This line of code creates a new temporary file in the specified directory with a unique name. The prefix and suffix are used to name the file.\n\nAPI: File\nCODE: File tempDir = File.createTempFile(\"prefix\", \".suffix\", tempDir);\nEXPLANATION: This line of code creates a new temporary directory in"}
