Thanks for everyone's help. Case closed, goodnight :)\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: $CODE\nFileReader fr = new FileReader(filename);\nBufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);\nString line;\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    outputTextArea.append(line + \"\\n\");\n}\nbr.close();\n$EXPLANATION: The FileReader reads characters from a file. BufferedReader reads text from a character-input stream, buffering characters so as to provide for the efficient reading of characters, arrays, and lines. We read each line from the file using br.readLine() and append it to the JTextArea.\n$API: BufferedReader, FileReader, JTextArea.append.\n\n\nA: You can use a BufferedReader to read the file line by line, and then append each line to the JTextArea. Here's how you can do it:\nFileReader fr = new FileReader(filename);\nBufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);\nString line;\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    outputTextArea.append(line + \"\\n\");\n}\nbr.close();\n\nThis code creates a FileReader to read from the file, a BufferedReader to buffer the input, and then reads each line from the file until there are no more lines. For each line, it appends the line to the JTextArea followed by a newline character. After all lines have been read and appended, it closes the BufferedReader.\n\nA: You can use the FileReader and BufferedReader classes to read the file line by line. Then you can append each line to the JTextArea. Here is an example:\ntry (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filename))) {\n    String line;\n    while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n        outputTextArea.append(line + \"\\n\");\n    }\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n\nThis code opens the file, reads each line, and appends it to the JTextArea. The \"\\n\" at the end of each line is to ensure that each line is separated by a newline character. If an error occurs while reading the file, it is caught and printed to the console.\n\nA: Here is the code to read a text file and display its content in a JTextArea:\nimport javax.swing.JTextArea;\nimport java.io.BufferedReader;\nimport java.io.FileReader;\nimport java.io.IOException;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        JTextArea textArea = new JTextArea();\n        String fileName = \"yourfile.txt\";\n\n        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(fileName))) {\n            StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n            String line = br.readLine();\n\n            while (line != null) {\n                sb.append(line);\n                sb.append(System.lineSeparator());\n                line = br.readLine();\n            }\n\n            textArea.setText(sb.toString());\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThis code reads the file line by line and appends each line to a StringBuilder. It then sets the text of the JTextArea to the contents of the StringBuilder.\n\nA: Here is the code to read a text file and display its content in a JTextArea:\nimport javax.swing.JTextArea;\nimport java.io.BufferedReader;\nimport java.io.FileReader;\nimport java.io.IOException;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        JTextArea textArea = new JTextArea();\n        String fileName = \"yourfile.txt\";\n\n        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(fileName))) {\n            StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n            String line = br.readLine();\n\n            while (line != null) {\n                sb.append(line);\n                sb.append(System.lineSeparator());\n                line = br.readLine();\n            }\n\n            textArea.setText(sb.toString());\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}"}
