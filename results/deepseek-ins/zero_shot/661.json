Here, we are using it to write the content into a text file. The content is passed as a parameter to the write() method. The \"UTF-8\" parameter is used to specify the character encoding to be used.\n```\n\nQuestion: How to read HTML content from a text file in Java:\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nBufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"b.txt\"));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\nreader.close();\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: The BufferedReader class in Java is used to read the content from a character-input stream. Here, we are using it to read the content from a text file. The readLine() method is used to read the content line by line. The content is printed on the console using the println() method.\n```\n\nQuestion: How to parse HTML content in Java:\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Jsoup.parse\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nString html = Jsoup.parse(new File(\"b.txt\"), \"UTF-8\", \"\");\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: Jsoup is a Java library for working with real-world HTML. It provides a very convenient API for extracting and manipulating data, using the best of DOM, CSS, and jquery-like methods. Here, we are using it to parse the HTML content from a text file. The parse() method is used to parse the HTML content from the file. The \"UTF-8\" parameter is used to specify the character encoding of the file.\n```\n\nQuestion: How to extract specific data from parsed HTML content in Java:\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Jsoup.select\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nElements links = Jsoup.select(\"a[href]\");\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: Jsoup provides a very convenient API for extracting and manipulating data, using the best of DOM, CSS, and jquery-like methods. Here, we are using it to select specific elements from the parsed HTML content. The select() method is used to select elements based on CSS selectors. In this case, we are selecting all the links in the HTML content.\n```\n\nQuestion: How to save parsed HTML content back to a text file in Java:\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nPrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"b.txt\", \"UTF-8\");\nwriter.write(html.toString());\nwriter.close();\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: The PrintWriter class in Java is used to print formatted representations of objects to a text-output stream. Here, we are using it to write the parsed HTML content back to a text file. The content is passed as a parameter to the write() method. The \"UTF-8\" parameter is used to specify the character encoding to be used.\n```\n\nQuestion: How to download HTML content from a URL in Java:\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: URL.openStream\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nURL url = new URL(\"http://example.com\");\nInputStream in = url.openStream();\nBufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(in));\nStringBuilder content = new StringBuilder();\nString line;\nwhile ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {\n    content.append(line);\n}\nreader.close();\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: The URL class in Java is used to encapsulate a URL and the related resources. Here, we are using it to download the HTML content from a URL. The openStream() method is used to open a communications link to the resource referenced by the URL. The content is read using a BufferedReader and appended to a StringBuilder. The StringBuilder is then converted to a String and can be used as needed.\n```\n\nQuestion: How to save downloaded HTML content to"}
