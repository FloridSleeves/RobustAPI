It sets the length of the file to the value specified as the argument to the method. In this case, we are passing 0 as the argument, which means we are setting the length of the file to 0, effectively truncating it.\n```\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java: :What is the best-practice way to read a file in Java?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Files.readAllLines\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nList<String> lines = Files.readAllLines(Paths.get(fileName));\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: The Files.readAllLines() method in Java is used to read all lines from a file and return them as a List of Strings. The file is specified by the Path object returned by the Paths.get() method. This method is more efficient and safer than using a Scanner to read the file, as it automatically closes the file and handles exceptions.\n```\nQuestion: How to write to a file in Java: :What is the best-practice way to write to a file in Java?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Files.write\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nList<String> lines = Arrays.asList(\"line1\", \"line2\", \"line3\");\nFiles.write(Paths.get(fileName), lines);\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: The Files.write() method in Java is used to write content to a file. The file is specified by the Path object returned by the Paths.get() method. The content to be written is passed as a List of Strings. If the file does not exist, it will be created. If the file does exist, it will be overwritten. This method is more efficient and safer than using a FileWriter or PrintWriter to write to the file, as it automatically closes the file and handles exceptions.\n```\nQuestion: How to append to a file in Java: :What is the best-practice way to append to a file in Java?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Files.write\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nList<String> lines = Arrays.asList(\"line4\", \"line5\", \"line6\");\nFiles.write(Paths.get(fileName), lines, StandardOpenOption.APPEND);\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: The Files.write() method in Java can also be used to append content to a file. The file is specified by the Path object returned by the Paths.get() method. The content to be appended is passed as a List of Strings. The StandardOpenOption.APPEND option is used to specify that the file should be opened for appending. If the file does not exist, it will be created. If the file does exist, the new content will be added at the end of the file. This method is more efficient and safer than using a FileWriter or PrintWriter to append to the file, as it automatically closes the file and handles exceptions.\n```\nQuestion: How to read a file line by line in Java: :What is the best-practice way to read a file line by line in Java?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Files.lines\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\ntry (Stream<String> stream = Files.lines(Paths.get(fileName))) {\n    stream.forEach(System.out::println);\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: The Files.lines() method in Java is used to read a file line by line. The file is specified by the Path object returned by the Paths.get() method. The lines are returned as a Stream of Strings, which can be processed using the Stream API. This method is more efficient and safer than using a Scanner to read the file, as it automatically closes the file and handles exceptions.\n```\nQuestion: How to write to a file in Java: :What is the best-practice way to write to a file in Java?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Files.write\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nList<String> lines = Arrays.asList(\"line1\", \"line2\", \""}
