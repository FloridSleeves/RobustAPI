I have watched countless videos and am utterly lost at this point.  the examples in the text are for one main method that outputs the text.

The `PrintWriter` constructor takes two parameters: the file name and the character set.\n- I have used `Arrays.toString` to convert the arrays to strings that can be written to the file.\n- I have called `writer.close()` to close the file after writing.\n- I have thrown `FileNotFoundException` in the `main` method because `textRead` might throw this exception.\n- I have changed the return type of `calcAverage` to `double` to allow for decimal places in the average.\n- I have also corrected the `textRead` method to match the correct syntax.\n\nThis code will write the random numbers, the frequency of each number, and the average to a text file named \"randomIntegers.txt\".\n\nI hope this helps you.
