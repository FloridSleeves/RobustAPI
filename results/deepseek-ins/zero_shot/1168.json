Now I just have to put all the words of the String into an array as the elements. However, I'm not sure how to proceed.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: Here is how you can do it:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.StringTokenizer;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String sentence = \"This is a test sentence\";\n        String[] words = split(sentence);\n        for(String word : words) {\n            System.out.println(word);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static String[] split(String s) {\n        // create a StringTokenizer object\n        StringTokenizer tokenizer = new StringTokenizer(s);\n\n        // determine the number of words\n        int countWords = tokenizer.countTokens();\n\n        // create appropriate array and store the string\u2019s words in it\n        String[] words = new String[countWords];\n        int i = 0;\n        while (tokenizer.hasMoreTokens()) {\n            words[i] = tokenizer.nextToken();\n            i++;\n        }\n\n        return words;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe `split` method uses a `StringTokenizer` to split the input string `s` into words. The `countTokens` method of `StringTokenizer` is used to determine the number of words in the string. Then, an array of Strings is created with the size of the number of words. The `nextToken` method of `StringTokenizer` is used to get the next word from the string and store it in the array. The array is then returned.\n\nIn the `main` method, we call the `split` method with a test sentence and print out each word in the returned array.\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nThis\nis\na\ntest\nsentence\n```\n\nwhich are the words in the sentence.\n\nNote: The `StringTokenizer` class is deprecated in Java 8 and removed in Java 9. If you are using Java 9 or later, you should use the `java.util.Scanner` class with the `useDelimiter` method to split the string into words.\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String sentence = \"This is a test sentence\";\n        String[] words = split(sentence);\n        for(String word : words) {\n            System.out.println(word);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static String[] split(String s) {\n        // create a Scanner object with space as delimiter\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(s).useDelimiter(\" \");\n\n        // determine the number of words\n        int countWords = 0;\n        while (scanner.hasNext()) {\n            scanner.next();\n            countWords++;\n        }\n\n        // create appropriate array and store the string\u2019s words in it\n        String[] words = new String[countWords];\n        scanner = new Scanner(s).useDelimiter(\" \");\n        int i = 0;\n        while (scanner.hasNext()) {\n            words[i] = scanner.next();\n            i++;\n        }\n\n        return words;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis will give the same output as the previous example.\n\nNote: The `useDelimiter` method sets the delimiter for the `Scanner` object. In this case, we set it to a space character, which means the `Scanner` will split the string at each space.\n\nNote: The `Scanner` class is not part of the Java API, but it is a class in the Java standard library that is used for parsing input. It is a more powerful and flexible alternative to `StringTokenizer`.\n\nNote: The `Scanner` class is not part of the Java API, but it is a class in the Java standard library that is used for parsing input.
