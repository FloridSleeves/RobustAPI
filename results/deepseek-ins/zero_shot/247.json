The readUTF() method is used to read a string that was written using the writeUTF() method in the C# program. The UTFDataFormatException is thrown if the data is not in the correct UTF format.\nIn your case, you should be able to read the data correctly using the readInt(), readUTF() methods. Make sure that the file was written in the same order and with the same encoding.\n\nA: The problem is likely not with your Java code, but with the way you're writing the data in C#.\nIn C#, BinaryWriter.Write() writes primitive types and strings as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*For int, it writes 4 bytes in little-endian order.\n\n*For string, it writes the length of the string as a 4-byte integer in little-endian order, followed by the string data.\n\n\nIn Java, DataInputStream.readInt() reads 4 bytes in little-endian order to get an int, and DataInputStream.readUTF() reads a 4-byte length field, followed by that many bytes of UTF-8 data.\nThese are not the same formats, so you're getting a UTFDataFormatException.\nYou can fix this by writing the data in the same format that you're reading it in Java. Here's how you can do it:\nIn C#:\nusing (BinaryWriter writer = new BinaryWriter(File.Open(\"filename\", FileMode.Create)))\n{\n    writer.Write(1); // int\n    writer.Write(\"string1\"); // string\n    writer.Write(\"string2\"); // string\n    writer.Write(\"string3\"); // string\n}\n\nIn Java:\ntry (DataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(\"filename\"))) {\n    dos.writeInt(1); // int\n    dos.writeUTF(\"string1\"); // string\n    dos.writeUTF(\"string2\"); // string\n    dos.writeUTF(\"string3\"); // string\n}\n\nNow your Java code should read the data correctly.\n\nA: You can use DataInputStream.readFully() to read the bytes into a byte array and then convert them to the appropriate types. This way you can avoid the UTFDataFormatException.\nHere is an example:\nFileInputStream fs = new FileInputStream(strFilePath);\nDataInputStream ds = new DataInputStream(fs);\nbyte[] bytes = new byte[4];\nds.readFully(bytes);\nint i = ByteBuffer.wrap(bytes).getInt();\nbytes = new byte[1024];\nds.readFully(bytes);\nString str1 = new String(bytes).trim();\nbytes = new byte[1024];\nds.readFully(bytes);\nString str2 = new String(bytes).trim();\nbytes = new byte[1024];\nds.readFully(bytes);\nString str3 = new String(bytes).trim();\nds.close();\n\nThis code reads the int and the strings byte by byte and then converts them to the appropriate types. The trim() method is used to remove any trailing null characters.\nNote: The size of the byte array (1024 in this case) should be large enough to hold the longest string you expect to read.\n\nA: You can use DataInputStream.readFully() to read the bytes into a byte array and then convert them to the appropriate types.
