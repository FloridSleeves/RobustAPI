However, you are using `InputStreamReader` which is meant for reading characters, not bytes. You should use `InputStream` directly to read bytes.\n\nHere is the corrected code:\n\n```java\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    String myString = \"H4sIAAAAAAAAAO3NoREAMAgEsLedAfafE4+s6l0jolNJiif18tt/Fj8AAMC9ARtYg28AEAAA\";\n    byte[] decode = Base64.decodeBase64(myString);\n    ByteArrayInputStream byteArrayInputStream = new ByteArrayInputStream(decode);\n    GZIPInputStream gzipInputStream;\n    try {\n        gzipInputStream = new GZIPInputStream(byteArrayInputStream);\n        byte[] buffer = new byte[4];\n        int bytesRead;\n        while ((bytesRead = gzipInputStream.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n            for (int i = 0; i < bytesRead; i++) {\n                int value = buffer[i] & 0xFF;\n                System.out.println(\"read :\" + value);\n            }\n        }\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code reads 4 bytes at a time from the gzip input stream and prints each byte as an integer. The `& 0xFF` is used to ensure that the byte is treated as an unsigned value.\n\nPlease note that the TMX format specifies that GIDs are stored as little-endian 4-byte integers. Therefore, you may need to convert the bytes to an integer in little-endian order.\n\n```java\npublic static int bytesToIntLittleEndian(byte[] bytes) {\n    return bytes[0] & 0xFF | (bytes[1] & 0xFF) << 8 | (bytes[2] & 0xFF) << 16 | (bytes[3] & 0xFF) << 24;\n}\n```\n\nYou can use this function to convert the 4-byte buffer to an integer before printing it.\n\n```java\nint value = bytesToIntLittleEndian(buffer);\nSystem.out.println(\"read :\" + value);\n```\n\nThis should give you the expected output.\n\nNote: The `GZIPInputStream` class is part of the `java.util.zip` package, so you need to import it if you haven't already.\n\n```java\nimport java.util.zip.GZIPInputStream;\n```\n\nAlso, make sure to handle the `IOException` that may be thrown by the `read` method.\n\nI hope this helps.
