However, when I do lazy loading in Java/Hibernate. What is the recommended way to iterate over the collection using lazy loading and something similar to yield return ?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: Yes, there is a way to achieve lazy loading in Hibernate using Iterator.next(). This method will fetch the next element from the database as soon as it is called.\n\nCode:\n```java\nIterator<Entity> iterator = entityList.iterator();\nwhile(iterator.hasNext()) {\n    Entity entity = iterator.next();\n    // do something with entity\n}\n```\n\nExplanation: In the above code, the iterator.next() method is used to fetch the next element from the database as soon as it is called. This is a lazy loading mechanism in Hibernate. The iterator.hasNext() method is used to check if there are more elements in the collection. This way, we can iterate over the collection using lazy loading.\n\nPlease note that the iterator.next() method will throw a NoSuchElementException if there are no more elements in the collection. So, it's important to check if there are more elements before calling iterator.next().\n\nAlso, keep in mind that the iterator fetches elements one by one from the database, so it's not exactly like a \"yield return\" construct in C#.\n```\n\nI hope this helps.
