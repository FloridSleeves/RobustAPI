The first element is stored in the variable 'first'. Then, for each remaining element in the list, it checks if it is equal to the first element. If any element is not equal to the first, the function returns false. If the function has not returned false by the time it has iterated over all elements, it means all elements are identical and it returns true.\n```\n\nQuestion: How to check whether elements are identical in the list?: :Is there a cleaner way in Java to confirm that all elements in List are identical?boolean elementsAreIdentical() {  return new HashSet<O>(list).size() == 1;}By 'cleaner', i wonder if we can do this without having to create a brand new object?
