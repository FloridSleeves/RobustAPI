The decryption function expects the input data to be a multiple of 8 bytes. The PKCS5Padding scheme adds padding to the input data to make it a multiple of 8 bytes. If the input data is not a multiple of 8 bytes, the decryption function will throw an IllegalBlockSizeException. To fix this, you need to ensure that the encrypted data is a multiple of 8 bytes.\n\n        You can add padding to the encrypted data in Java using the following code:\n\n        ```java\n        byte[] encryptedData = cipher.doFinal(userPin3DESEncrypted.getBytes());\n        byte[] paddedData = new byte[((encryptedData.length + 7) / 8) * 8];\n        System.arraycopy(encryptedData, 0, paddedData, 0, encryptedData.length);\n        userPinDecrypted = new String(cipher.doFinal(paddedData));\n        ```\n\n        This code adds padding to the encrypted data so that it is a multiple of 8 bytes. The padding is added by copying the encrypted data to the padded data array, and then filling the rest of the array with zeros.\n\n        Alternatively, you can use the PKCS5Padding scheme in the Java code to add padding to the encrypted data. This can be done by using the PKCS5Padding class from the Bouncy Castle library. Here is an example:\n\n        ```java\n        PKCS5Padding padding = new PKCS5Padding();\n        byte[] paddedData = padding.addPadding(encryptedData, cipher.getBlockSize());\n        userPinDecrypted = new String(cipher.doFinal(paddedData));\n        ```\n\n        This code uses the PKCS5Padding class to add padding to the encrypted data. The addPadding method takes the encrypted data and the block size as parameters, and returns the padded data. The block size is obtained from the Cipher object.\n\n        Both of these solutions should ensure that the encrypted data is a multiple of 8 bytes, and should prevent the IllegalBlockSizeException from being thrown.\n\n        Please note that the Bouncy Castle library is not included in the standard Java distribution, so you will need to download and install it separately.\n\n        I hope this helps, and let me know if you have any other questions.\n\n        Best regards,\n\n        Luca\n\n        PS: I'm sorry for the confusion, but I'm not sure if the above solution is correct. I've tried it and it didn't work. The error still persists. The encrypted text is the same on both Linux and Windows. The key is the same. I believe the problem might be with the way the encrypted text is being sent to the Java application. I'm not sure what else to try.\n\n        Please let me know if you have any other ideas.\n\n        Best regards,\n\n        Luca\n\n        PS: I've tried to use the Bouncy Castle library to add padding to the encrypted text, but it still doesn't work.
