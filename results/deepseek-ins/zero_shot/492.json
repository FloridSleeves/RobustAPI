It locks the read operations with a read lock and the write operations with a write lock. This ensures that only one thread can write to the map at a time, but multiple threads can read from the map simultaneously. The LinkedHashMap is extended to override the get, put, remove and clear methods to use the appropriate lock. The override methods call the super method and ensure the lock is unlocked in a finally block. This ensures that the lock is always released, even if an exception is thrown.\n\nThe ReadWriteLock allows for better concurrency than the synchronized keyword, as it allows multiple readers to access the map simultaneously, but only one writer at a time. This is more efficient than using a single lock for both read and write operations.\n\nThe override of the removeEldestEntry method is not shown in this code, but it would be used to implement a circular queue behavior. The oldest entry would be removed when the map size exceeds the limit of 50 entries.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the Oracle MAF environment supports the use of the java.util.concurrent.locks.ReadWriteLock. If it does not, you may need to use a different approach to ensure thread safety.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>"}
