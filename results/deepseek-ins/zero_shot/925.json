It returns an array of bytes representing the characters in the string.\n\nNote: By default, it uses the platform's default character encoding. If you want to specify a different encoding, you can use the getBytes(Charset charset) method.\n\nIn your case, you are reading the file line by line and trying to convert each line into a byte. If a line contains more than one byte, it will throw a NumberFormatException because Byte.parseByte(String s, int radix) method expects a string representing a single byte in the given radix. You should use str.getBytes() to convert the whole string into bytes.\n```\n\nQuestion: How to read a file in java:\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: FileInputStream\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nFile file = new File(\"C:/Users/data.txt\");\nFileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(file);\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: The FileInputStream class in Java is used to read data from a file. It is part of the java.io package. It is used for reading byte-oriented data (like image, audio). To read a file in Java, you need to create an instance of FileInputStream by passing the path of the file as a parameter.\n\nNote: Make sure the file exists and you have the necessary read permissions. Also, remember to close the stream after you're done reading the file to free up system resources.\n```\n\nQuestion: How to read a file line by line in java:\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: BufferedReader\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nFile file = new File(\"C:/Users/data.txt\");\nFileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(file);\nBufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(fis));\n\nString line;\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n\nbr.close();\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: The BufferedReader class in Java is used to read text from a character-input stream, buffering characters so as to provide for the efficient reading of characters, arrays, and lines.\n\nTo read a file line by line, you need to create an instance of BufferedReader by passing an instance of InputStreamReader (which takes a FileInputStream as a parameter) to its constructor. Then, you can use the readLine() method in a loop to read the file line by line.\n\nRemember to close the BufferedReader after you're done reading the file to free up system resources.\n```\n\nQuestion: How to convert string to byte in java:\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: String.getBytes()\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nString str = \"Hello World\";\nbyte[] bytes = str.getBytes();\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: The getBytes() method in Java is used to convert a string into a sequence of bytes.
