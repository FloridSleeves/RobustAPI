Then we iterate over the iterable with the iterator's hasNext and next methods. The next method returns an Object, so we cast it to a Number. Then we add the doubleValue of the number to the result.\n\n\nA: The problem is that you're trying to use the += operator with an Object, which doesn't have an overloaded += operator. You can use the doubleValue() method to convert the Number to a double before adding it to the result.\nHere's how you can modify your method:\nprivate static <T extends Number> double sum(Iterable<? extends T> it) {\n    double result = 0;\n    for(T next : it) {\n        result += next.doubleValue();\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\nThis method will now work with any Iterable of Numbers, including Integers, Doubles, and Longs.\n\nA: You can use the doubleValue() method of Number class to convert the Number to double before adding it to the result.\nprivate static <T extends Number> double sum(Iterable<? extends T> it) {\n    double result = 0;\n    for(T next : it) {\n        result += next.doubleValue();\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\nThis way, you're not trying to use the += operator on an Object, which is what the compiler error is telling you.\n\nA: You can use the doubleValue() method of Number class to convert the Number to double before adding it to the result.\nprivate static <T extends Number> double sum(Iterable<? extends T> it) {\n    double result = 0;\n    for(T next : it) {\n        result += next.doubleValue();\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\nThis way, you're not trying to use the += operator on an Object, which is what the compiler error is telling you.\n\nA: You can use the doubleValue() method of Number class to convert the Number to double before adding it to the result.\nprivate static <T extends Number> double sum(Iterable<? extends T> it) {\n    double result = 0;\n    for(T next : it) {\n        result += next.doubleValue();\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\nThis way, you're not trying to use the += operator on an Object, which is what the compiler error is telling you.\n\nA: You can use the doubleValue() method of Number class to convert the Number to double before adding it to the result.\nprivate static <T extends Number> double sum(Iterable<? extends T> it) {\n    double result = 0;\n    for(T next : it) {\n        result += next.doubleValue();\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\nThis way, you're not trying to use the += operator on an Object, which is what the compiler error is telling you.\n\nA: You can use the doubleValue() method of Number class to convert the Number to double before adding it to the result.\nprivate static <T extends Number> double sum(Iterable<? extends T> it) {\n    double result = 0;\n    for(T next : it) {\n        result += next.doubleValue();\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\nThis way, you're not trying to use the += operator on an Object, which is what the compiler error is telling you.\n\nA: You can use the doubleValue() method of Number class to convert the Number to double before adding it to the result.\nprivate static <T extends Number> double sum(Iterable<? extends T> it) {\n    double result = 0;\n    for(T next : it) {\n        result += next.doubleValue();\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\nThis way, you're not trying to use the += operator on an Object, which is what the compiler error is telling you.\n\nA: You can use the doubleValue() method of Number class to convert the Number to double before adding it to the result.\nprivate static <T extends Number> double sum"}
