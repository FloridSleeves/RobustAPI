They declare an integer variable named \"x\" and assign the value \"10\" to it.\n<<<code>>>: Both codes do the same thing. They declare an integer variable named \"x\" and assign the value \"10\" to it.\n<<<explanation>>>: The difference is that in Code 2, the variable \"x\" is declared and initialized in the same line. In Code 1, the variable \"x\" is declared and then initialized.\n\nQuestion: What is the output of the following code?\n\n```java\npublic class MyClass {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int x = 10;\n        System.out.println(x++);\n        System.out.println(x);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: The output of the code will be:\n<<<code>>>: 10\n11\n<<<explanation>>>: The first `System.out.println(x++);` will print the value of `x` which is 10. After that, `x` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 11. The second `System.out.println(x);` will print the new value of `x` which is 11.\n\nQuestion: What is the output of the following code?\n\n```java\npublic class MyClass {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int x = 10;\n        System.out.println(++x);\n        System.out.println(x);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: The output of the code will be:\n<<<code>>>: 11\n11\n<<<explanation>>>: The first `System.out.println(++x);` will increment `x` by 1 and then print the value of `x` which is 11. The second `System.out.println(x);` will print the value of `x` which is still 11 because the increment has been applied.\n\nQuestion: What is the output of the following code?\n\n```java\npublic class MyClass {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int x = 10;\n        System.out.println(x--);\n        System.out.println(x);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: The output of the code will be:\n<<<code>>>: 10\n9\n<<<explanation>>>: The first `System.out.println(x--);` will print the value of `x` which is 10. After that, `x` is decremented by 1, so it becomes 9. The second `System.out.println(x);` will print the new value of `x` which is 9.\n\nQuestion: What is the output of the following code?\n\n```java\npublic class MyClass {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int x = 10;\n        System.out.println(--x);\n        System.out.println(x);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: The output of the code will be:\n<<<code>>>: 9\n9\n<<<explanation>>>: The first `System.out.println(--x);` will decrement `x` by 1 and then print the value of `x` which is 9.
