The string is split at each space. The first token is stored in replace. This will give us the first part of the string before the space.\n\nI am not sure if this is the best way to do it, but it does work.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\n\nA: You can use the substring method to remove the last three characters from the string.\nHere is the code:\nString time = \"1.2 sec\";\nString result = time.substring(0, time.length() - 4);\nSystem.out.println(result); // prints \"1.2\"\n\nIn this code, time.length() - 4 gives the index up to which we want to take the substring. The substring method takes two parameters: the start index and the end index. The end index is exclusive, so we subtract 4 to get the index up to which we want to take the substring.\n\nA: You can use the substring method of the String class.\nHere is how you can do it:\nString time = \"1.2 sec\";\nString result = time.substring(0, time.length() - 4);\nSystem.out.println(result);\n\nThis will print:\n1.2\n\nThe substring method takes two parameters: the start index and the end index. The end index is exclusive, so we subtract 4 from the length of the string to get the index up to which we want to take the substring.\n\nA: You can use the substring method of the String class.
