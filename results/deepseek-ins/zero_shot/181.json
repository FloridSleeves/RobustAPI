If you can assist with filling out the following method, I would be grateful.public List<String> ExecuteCommand (String command) {    //run command to existing connection    //Get returned lines to Array List and return the list}Thanks \nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nint c;\nStringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();\nwhile ((c = _channel.getInputStream().read()) != -1) {\n    builder.append((char) c);\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: The read method of InputStream returns an integer which represents the byte read from the stream. We convert this integer to a character and append it to a StringBuilder. We continue this process until the read method returns -1, which indicates the end of the stream. The StringBuilder is then converted to a List of Strings.\n```java\nList<String> result = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(builder.toString().split(\"\\\\r?\\\\n\")));\nreturn result;\n```\nThe result is a list of strings where each string is a line from the command's output. The split method is used to split the string into lines based on the newline character. The \"\\\\r?\\\\n\" pattern matches both Unix and Windows newline characters.\n```java\n_channel.getOutputStream().write((command + \"\\n\").getBytes());\n_channel.getOutputStream().flush();\n```\nThe command is written to the output stream of the channel and then flushed. The command is followed by a newline character to indicate the end of the command.\n```java\nreturn ExecuteCommand(command);\n```\nFinally, the method ExecuteCommand is called to read the output of the command from the input stream of the channel.\nThis should solve your problem.\n\nA: You can use the following code to execute a command and get the result:\n\n```java\npublic List<String> ExecuteCommand(String command) throws IOException {\n    _channel.getOutputStream().write((command + \"\\n\").getBytes());\n    _channel.getOutputStream().flush();\n\n    int c;\n    StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();\n    while ((c = _channel.getInputStream().read()) != -1) {\n        builder.append((char) c);\n    }\n\n    List<String> result = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(builder.toString().split(\"\\\\r?\\\\n\")));\n    return result;\n}\n```\n\nThis code writes the command to the output stream of the channel, then reads the output from the input stream of the channel. The output is split into lines and returned as a list of strings.\n\nPlease note that you need to handle exceptions properly in your code. The IOException is thrown by the write and read methods, so you should handle it in the method where you call ExecuteCommand.\n\nAlso, remember to call `_channel.disconnect()` or `_session.disconnect()` when you are done with the channel or session, respectively, to free up resources.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>"}
