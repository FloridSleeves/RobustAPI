We add tokens to an ArrayList and delimiters to another. We check if there are more tokens with `st.hasMoreTokens()` and get the next token with `st.nextToken()`. We add the token to the tokens ArrayList and the delimiter to the delimiters ArrayList.\n```java\nint tokenIndex = 0;\nint delimiterIndex = 0;\nwhile (tokenIndex < tokens.size() && delimiterIndex < delimiters.size()) {\n    System.out.println(\"Token: \" + tokens.get(tokenIndex) + \", Delimiter: \" + delimiters.get(delimiterIndex));\n    tokenIndex += 2;\n    delimiterIndex += 2;\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: We use a while loop to print the tokens and delimiters. We increment the tokenIndex and delimiterIndex by 2 at each iteration because we get a token and a delimiter at each step.\nAnswer: \n```java\nStringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(\"this + is - an * input\", \" +-*\");\nArrayList<String> tokens = new ArrayList<>();\nArrayList<String> delimiters = new ArrayList<>();\nwhile (st.hasMoreTokens()) {\n    tokens.add(st.nextToken());\n    if (st.hasMoreTokens()) {\n        delimiters.add(st.nextToken());\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code tokenizes the input string and separates the tokens and delimiters into two separate ArrayLists.\n```java\nint tokenIndex = 0;\nint delimiterIndex = 0;\nwhile (tokenIndex < tokens.size() && delimiterIndex < delimiters.size()) {\n    System.out.println(\"Token: \" + tokens.get(tokenIndex) + \", Delimiter: \" + delimiters.get(delimiterIndex));\n    tokenIndex += 2;\n    delimiterIndex += 2;\n}\n```\nThis code prints the tokens and delimiters in pairs. It uses the tokenIndex and delimiterIndex to get the tokens and delimiters at the corresponding indices. The tokenIndex and delimiterIndex are incremented by 2 at each iteration to get the next token and delimiter.\n```java\n// Output:\n// Token: this, Delimiter: +\n// Token: is, Delimiter: -\n// Token: an, Delimiter: *\n// Token: input, Delimiter: null\n```\nThis output shows that the tokens and delimiters are printed in pairs. The null is printed for the last delimiter because there is no corresponding delimiter for the last token.\n```java\n// If you want to get the delimiter for a specific token index 'i', you can use the following code:\nString delimiter = delimiters.get(i / 2);\n```\nThis code gets the delimiter for a specific token index 'i'. It divides 'i' by 2 to get the corresponding index in the delimiters ArrayList.\n```java\n// If you want to get the token for a specific delimiter index 'i', you can use the following code:\nString token = tokens.get(i / 2);\n```\nThis code gets the token for a specific delimiter index 'i'. It divides 'i' by 2 to get the corresponding index in the tokens ArrayList.\n```java\n// If you want to get the next token and delimiter, you can use the following code:\nString nextToken = tokens.get(tokenIndex);\nString nextDelimiter = delimiters.get(delimiterIndex);\n```\nThis code gets the next token and delimiter. It uses the tokenIndex and delimiterIndex to get the tokens"}
