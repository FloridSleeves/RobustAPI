The \"\\t\" is a tab character that separates the two values, and the \"\\n\" is a newline character that starts a new line for each number.\n\nA: You can use PrintWriter's write method to write to the file.\nHere is how you can modify your code:\n```java\nPrintWriter outputFile = new PrintWriter(OUTPUT_FILE);\n\nwhile (inputFile.hasNext()) {\n    numberOfNumbers++;\n    oneNumber = inputFile.nextDouble();\n    sum += oneNumber;\n    runningTotal += oneNumber;\n    average = sum / numberOfNumbers;\n\n    outputFile.write(oneNumber + \"\\t\" + runningTotal + \"\\n\");\n\n    System.out.printf(\"%-10.2f\\t %.2f\\n\", oneNumber, runningTotal);\n}\n\noutputFile.close();\ninputFile.close();\n```\n\nIn this code, `outputFile.write(oneNumber + \"\\t\" + runningTotal + \"\\n\");` writes the number and running total to the output file. The \"\\t\" is a tab character that separates the two values, and the \"\\n\" is a newline character that starts a new line for each number.\n\nRemember to close the PrintWriter after you're done writing to the file to ensure all data is written to the file.\n\nAlso, don't forget to close the Scanner after you're done reading from the file.\n\nThis should solve your problem.\n\nA: You can use the PrintWriter's printf method to write formatted output to the file. Here is how you can modify your code:\n\n```java\nPrintWriter outputFile = new PrintWriter(OUTPUT_FILE);\n\nwhile (inputFile.hasNext()) {\n    numberOfNumbers++;\n    oneNumber = inputFile.nextDouble();\n    sum += oneNumber;\n    runningTotal += oneNumber;\n    average = sum / numberOfNumbers;\n\n    outputFile.printf(\"%-10.2f\\t%.2f\\n\", oneNumber, runningTotal);\n\n    System.out.printf(\"%-10.2f\\t%.2f\\n\", oneNumber, runningTotal);\n}\n\noutputFile.close();\ninputFile.close();\n```\n\nIn this code, `outputFile.printf(\"%-10.2f\\t%.2f\\n\", oneNumber, runningTotal);` writes the number and running total to the output file using printf's format specifiers. The \"-10.2f\" is a format specifier for a floating-point number that is left-justified in a 10-character field, and \".2f\" is a format specifier for a floating-point number with 2 digits after the decimal point. The \"\\t\" is a tab character that separates the two values, and the \"\\n\" is a newline character that starts a new line for each number.\n\nRemember to close the PrintWriter after you're done writing to the file to ensure all data is written to the file.\n\nAlso, don't forget to close the Scanner after you're done reading from the file.\n\nThis should solve your problem.\n\nA: You can use the PrintWriter's println method to write to the file.

The \"\\t\" is a tab character that separates the two values, and the `println` method automatically adds a new"}
