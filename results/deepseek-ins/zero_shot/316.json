However, this class does not provide a method to get the DPI. You can only set it. Here is an example:\n\n```java\nIterator<ImageReader> iterator = ImageIO.getImageReadersByFormatName(\"jpg\");\nImageReader reader = iterator.next();\nImageReadParam param = reader.getDefaultReadParam();\nparam.setSourceDpi(300, 300); // Set the DPI\nreader.setInput(ImageIO.read(file));\nBufferedImage image = reader.read(0, param);\n```\n\nIn this example, we are setting the DPI of the image to 300 DPI. The DPI is set in the ImageReadParam object. The ImageReader object is used to read the image. The read method is used to read the image and the DPI is set in the ImageReadParam object.\n\nPlease note that this method will only set the DPI of the image. To get the DPI of the image, you would need to parse the EXIF data of the image. This is not supported by the ImageIO class. You would need to use a library such as JExif or Apache Tika to parse the EXIF data of the image.\n\n```java\nExifIFD0 exif = new ExifIFD0(file);\nfloat dpi = exif.getDpi();\n```\n\nIn this example, we are using the JExif library to parse the EXIF data of the image and get the DPI. The DPI is returned as a float.\n\nPlease note that not all images will have an EXIF data. If the image does not have EXIF data, the getDpi method will return 0.0.\n\nI hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\nAnswer: $ANSWER\n\nQuestion: How to get the dpi of an image(Java):\n\n<<<api>>>: ImageIO.read(file)\n<<<code>>>: BufferedImage image = ImageIO.read(file);\n<<<explanation>>>: This will read the image file and return a BufferedImage object.\n\nAnswer: You can get the DPI of an image in Java by using the ImageReadParam class.
