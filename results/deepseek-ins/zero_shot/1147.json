Here is a sample code:\n\n```java\ntry {\n    String str = text.getText();\n    int count = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++) {\n        if (str.charAt(i) == '/') {\n            count++;\n        }\n    }\n    if (count != 2) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Invalid date format. Expected format is DD/MM/YYYY\");\n    }\n    StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(str, \"/\");\n    String DD = st.nextToken();\n    String MM = st.nextToken();\n    String YYYY = st.nextToken();\n} catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {\n    // Handle the exception\n}\n```\n\nThis code first counts the number of \"/\" in the input string. If the count is not 2, it throws an IllegalArgumentException. Otherwise, it splits the input string into DD, MM, and YYYY using StringTokenizer.\n\nQuestion: What is the advantage of using StringTokenizer over the split method? :\nAnswer: $EXPLANATION.\nThe StringTokenizer class is more efficient and flexible than the split method in the following ways:\n\n1. StringTokenizer can specify a delimiter (in this case, \"/\"). This makes it easier to split the string into tokens.\n2. StringTokenizer can also specify a delimiter that should be ignored (for example, multiple consecutive \"/\" characters). This is not possible with the split method.\n3. StringTokenizer has a nextToken method that returns the next token without removing it from the string. This can be useful if you want to process the tokens in the order they appear in the string.\n4. StringTokenizer is a legacy class that is part of the Java language itself. It is part of the Java API, but it is not recommended for new code. The split method is more modern and widely used.\n\nOverall, if you need to split a string into tokens based on a specific delimiter, StringTokenizer is a better choice than the split method.\n\nQuestion: What is the difference between the split method and StringTokenizer? :\nAnswer: $EXPLANATION.\nBoth the split method and StringTokenizer can be used to split a string into tokens based on a delimiter. However, they have some differences:\n\n1. The split method returns an array of strings, while StringTokenizer returns a StringTokenizer object that you can iterate over. This makes StringTokenizer more flexible, as it allows you to process the tokens in the order they appear in the string.\n2. StringTokenizer can specify a delimiter that should be ignored (for example, multiple consecutive \"/\" characters). This is not possible with the split method.\n3.
