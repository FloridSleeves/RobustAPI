You can find the names of all EXIF tags in the EXIF specification.\n\nNote: The ImageIO.read() method can throw an IOException if the image file cannot be read. You should handle this exception appropriately in your code.\n\nNote: The ImageIO.write() method can throw an IOException if the image file cannot be written. You should handle this exception appropriately in your code.\n\nNote: The getProperty() method of the BufferedImage class can return null if the image does not have EXIF data. You should check for null before manipulating the EXIF data.\n\nNote: The setXXX() method of the IIOMetadata class can throw an IIOException if the EXIF data cannot be set. You should handle this exception appropriately in your code.\n\nNote: The setXXX() method of the IIOMetadata class can throw an IllegalArgumentException if the value of the EXIF data is invalid. You should handle this exception appropriately in your code.\n\nNote: The setXXX() method of the IIOMetadata class can"}
