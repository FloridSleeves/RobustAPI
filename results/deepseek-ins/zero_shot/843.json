However, since it takes around 3 seconds to complete, i don't just want the screen sitting and waiting for 3 seconds showing nothing. I would like it to display a ProgressDialog. I've tried everything in these threads and while most do 2 / 3, none seem to do all 3.Basically I have a button that when pressed, i want to parse the xml file and then use the data parsed from the file:void onButtonClicked() {    ProgressDialog pd = new ProgressDialog(this);    pd.setMessage(\"Parsing...\");    pd.show();    String[] ret;    return = parseXmlFile();    pd.dismiss();    if (ret[0] == \"steve\") {       sayHiToSteve();    }}  If I use an asyncTask, it will continue on with execution and check ret[0] before the task is completed and will just be null.if i do AsyncTask.get(), it pauses the execution but doesn't display the progress dialog, so that's no good either. I also looked at creating a seperate thread, but i had the same problem. I can't use a timer, because it is about 3 seconds (but can be up to 4 or 5 seconds if connection is slow), so i can't approximate. Any help is much appreciated.Thanks in advance.\nPlease using this api: ProgressDialog.dismiss.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to parse an xml file while pausing main execution but not the UI: :I need to parse an xml file which takes about 3 seconds, and immediately use the data that is parsed from the xml file after it has completed.

Here is an example of how you can do it:\n\n```java\nprivate class ParseXmlTask extends AsyncTask<Void, Void, String[]> {\n\n    ProgressDialog pd;\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onPreExecute() {\n        pd = new ProgressDialog(YourActivity.this);\n        pd.setMessage(\"Parsing...\");\n        pd.show();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected String[] doInBackground(Void... params) {\n        return parseXmlFile();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onPostExecute(String[] result) {\n        pd.dismiss();\n        if (result[0].equals(\"steve\")) {\n            sayHiToSteve();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nvoid onButtonClicked() {\n    new ParseXmlTask().execute();\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `ParseXmlTask` is an `AsyncTask` that takes no parameters, returns a `String[]`, and is defined within the `onButtonClicked` method. The `onPreExecute` method is called on the main thread before `doInBackground` is executed. In this method, we create and show the `ProgressDialog`. The `doInBackground` method is executed on a background thread and should contain the time-consuming operations such as parsing the XML file. The `onPostExecute` method is called on the main thread after `doInBackground` has finished. In this method, we dismiss the `ProgressDialog` and perform any necessary operations with the parsed data.\n\nThis way, the UI won't freeze while the XML file is being parsed, and the `ProgressDialog` will be displayed while the parsing is in progress.\n\nPlease replace `YourActivity` with the actual name of your activity.\n\nThis solution should solve your problem.\n\n```\n\n\nA: You can use AsyncTask to perform the parsing in the background and show a ProgressDialog while it's running. Here's an example:\n\n```java\nprivate class ParseXmlTask extends AsyncTask<Void, Void, String[]> {\n\n    ProgressDialog pd;\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onPreExecute() {\n        pd = new ProgressDialog(YourActivity.this);\n        pd.setMessage(\"Parsing...\");\n        pd.show();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected String[] doInBackground(Void... params) {\n        return parseXmlFile();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onPostExecute(String[] result) {\n        pd.dismiss();\n        if (result[0].equals(\"steve\")) {\n            sayHiToSteve();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nvoid onButtonClicked() {\n    new ParseXmlTask().execute();\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `ParseXmlTask` is an `AsyncTask` that takes no parameters, returns a `String[]`, and is defined within the `onButtonClicked` method.
