(Exception)\");    }}EDIT:More research suggests I use a Byte array, but this confuses me on how to represent a string and using strings is required?\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer: The issue with your code is that you're not properly converting your string to bytes. You're using `getBytes(Charset.forName(\"UTF-16\"))`, which is not correct. Minecraft server expects the handshake packet to be in UTF-8 encoding. So, you should use `getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)`.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\n```java\npublic static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n    InetSocketAddress host = new InetSocketAddress(\"162.244.165.111\", 48040);\n    Socket socket = new Socket();\n    System.out.println(\"Connecting...\");\n    socket.connect(host, 3000);\n    System.out.println(\"Done!\");\n    System.out.println(\"Making streams...\");\n    DataOutputStream output = new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());\n    DataInputStream input = new DataInputStream(socket.getInputStream());\n    System.out.println(\"Done!\");\n    System.out.println(\"Attempting handshake... \"+host.getAddress().toString().substring(1));\n    byte[] msg = (\"47;\"+host.getAddress().toString().substring(1)+\";\"+host.getPort()+\";2;\").getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8);\n    output.writeInt(msg.length+Integer.valueOf(0x00));\n    output.writeByte(0x00);\n    output.write(msg);\n    output.flush();\n    try {\n        if (input.readByte() != 0x02)\n            System.out.println(\"Failed!\");\n        else\n            System.out.println(\"Done!\");\n    } catch (EOFException e) {\n        System.out.println(\"Failed!\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code should now correctly send the handshake packet to the Minecraft server.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the Minecraft server expects the handshake packet to be in the format \"47;<ip>;<port>;2;\", where <ip> is the IP address of the server and <port> is the port number. If the server expects a different format, you'll need to adjust the code accordingly.\n\nAlso, please note that this code does not handle the server's response to the handshake. You'll need to add code to read and handle the server's response.\n\nI hope this helps, and let me know if you have any other questions.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>"}
