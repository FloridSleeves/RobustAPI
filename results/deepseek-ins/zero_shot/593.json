We then create an ArrayList of Nodes and add the nodes from our doubly linked list to this ArrayList. This way, we can access any node in our doubly linked list in O(1) time by using the get method of the ArrayList.\nFor example, to move node with ID 5 to the end of the list, we would do:\n```java\nNode node5 = nodeList.get(4); // Get the node with ID 5\ndll.remove(node5); // Remove node5 from the doubly linked list\ndll.append(node5); // Append node5 to the end of the doubly linked list\n```\nThis operation takes O(1) time because we can access any node in the doubly linked list in O(1) time using the get method of the ArrayList.\nPlease note that this approach assumes that the IDs of the nodes in the doubly linked list are unique. If the IDs are not unique, you would need a different approach to map the nodes to the ArrayList.\n```\n\nA: <<<api>>>: $List.get(index)\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nArrayList<Node> nodeList = new ArrayList<Node>();\nNode node1 = new Node(1);\nNode node2 = new Node(2);\nNode node3 = new Node(3);\nNode node4 = new Node(4);\nNode node5 = new Node(5);\n\nDoublyLinkedList dll = new DoublyLinkedList();\ndll.append(node1);\ndll.append(node2);\ndll.append(node3);\ndll.append(node4);\ndll.append(node5);\n\nnodeList.add(node1);\nnodeList.add(node2);\nnodeList.add(node3);\nnodeList.add(node4);\nnodeList.add(node5);\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: In this example, we first create a doubly linked list and append 5 nodes to it.
