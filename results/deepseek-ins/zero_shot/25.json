You can achieve this by using the setEnabled() and setClickable() methods in your MainActivity.java. \n\nsetEnabled(false) will disable the button and setClickable(false) will make it unclickable. You can set these properties in your onCreate() method or any other method where you want to disable the button. \n\nHere is an example:\n\n```java\nButton callButton = findViewById(R.id.callButton);\nif (!checkCallingOrSelfPermission(Manifest.permission.CALL_PHONE)) {\n    callButton.setEnabled(false);\n    callButton.setClickable(false);\n    callButton.setText(\"Call Button Disabled\");\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we first find the button by its ID and then check if the user has the CALL_PHONE permission. If the user does not have the permission, we disable the button and make it unclickable, and change its text to \"Call Button Disabled\". \n\nThis way, the button will be disabled and unclickable when the app is first opened on a tablet without a call function, and the user will not be able to call using the tablet without a call function.\n\nPlease note that you need to request the CALL_PHONE permission at runtime if it is not granted. You can do this using the ActivityCompat.requestPermissions() method.\n\n```java\nif (shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale(Manifest.permission.CALL_PHONE)) {\n    // Show an explanation to the user *asynchronously* -- don't block\n    // this thread waiting for the user's response. After the user\n    // sees the explanation, try again to request the permission.\n} else {\n    // No explanation needed, request the permission.\n    ActivityCompat.requestPermissions(this,\n            new String[]{Manifest.permission.CALL_PHONE},\n            MY_PERMISSIONS_REQUEST_CALL_PHONE);\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, we first check if we should show a rationale for requesting the CALL_PHONE permission. If we should, we show an explanation to the user. If we should not, we request the permission.\n\nPlease note that you need to handle the permission request result in the onRequestPermissionsResult() method.\n\n```java\n@Override\npublic void onRequestPermissionsResult(int requestCode,\n                                       String permissions[], int[] grantResults) {\n    switch (requestCode) {\n        case MY_PERMISSIONS_REQUEST_CALL_PHONE: {\n            // If request is cancelled, the result arrays are empty.\n            if (grantResults.length > 0\n                && grantResults[0] == PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {\n                // permission was granted, enable the button\n                Button callButton = findViewById(R.id.callButton);\n                callButton.setEnabled(true);\n                callButton.setClickable(true);\n                callButton.setText(\"Call\");\n            } else {\n                // permission denied, disable the button\n                Button callButton = findViewById(R.id.callButton);\n                callButton.setEnabled(false);\n                callButton.setClickable(false);\n                callButton.setText(\"Call Button Disabled\");\n            }\n            return;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, we handle the permission request result. If the permission is granted, we enable the button and change its text to \"Call\". If the permission is denied, we disable the button and change its text to \"Call Button Disabled\".\n\nPlease note that you need to import the following classes:\n\n```java\nimport android.Manifest;\nimport android.content.pm.PackageManager;\nimport androidx.core.app.ActivityCompat;\nimport androidx.core.content.ContextCompat;\n```\n\nThis way, you can disable the button and change its text depending on the permission status during runtime.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n"}
