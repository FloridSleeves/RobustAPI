CXF provides a SOAPHandler that can be used to handle SOAP messages. You can use this handler to parse the SOAP response. Here is a simple example:\n\n```java\nimport org.apache.cxf.binding.soap.SoapMessage;\nimport org.apache.cxf.interceptor.Fault;\nimport org.apache.cxf.phase.AbstractPhaseInterceptor;\nimport org.apache.cxf.phase.Phase;\n\npublic class MTOMHandler extends AbstractPhaseInterceptor<SoapMessage> {\n\n    public MTOMHandler() {\n        super(Phase.RECEIVE);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void handleMessage(SoapMessage soapMessage) throws Fault {\n        try {\n            // Get the SOAP body as an InputStream\n            InputStream is = (InputStream) soapMessage.getContent(InputStream.class);\n\n            // Parse the SOAP body using javax.xml\n            // You can use a SAXParser, a DocumentBuilder, or any other XML parsing method\n            // Here is an example using a SAXParser\n            SAXParserFactory factory = SAXParserFactory.newInstance();\n            SAXParser parser = factory.newSAXParser();\n            parser.parse(is, new DefaultHandler() {\n                // Implement your parsing logic here\n            });\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            throw new Fault(e);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou can add this handler to your CXF client like this:\n\n```java\nimport org.apache.cxf.jaxws.JaxWsProxyFactoryBean;\nimport org.apache.cxf.interceptor.InterceptorProvider;\n\npublic class SOAPClient {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        JaxWsProxyFactoryBean factory = new JaxWsProxyFactoryBean();\n        factory.setServiceClass(MyService.class);\n        factory.setAddress(\"http://example.com/myservice\");\n\n        MyService service = (MyService) factory.create();\n\n        InterceptorProvider provider = service._getBinding().getOutInterceptors();\n        provider.add(new MTOMHandler());\n\n        // Now you can call your service methods\n        service.someMethod();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis way, you can parse MTOM/XOP SOAP responses using Apache CXF, which provides a more convenient way to handle SOAP messages.\n\nPlease note that this is a simplified example. In a real-world scenario, you would need to handle other aspects of the SOAP message, such as SOAP headers and attachments.\n\nAlso, remember to add the necessary dependencies to your project, such as CXF and a XML parsing library like JAXP.\n\nI hope this helps you to parse MTOM/XOP SOAP responses using Java.\n\n<<<api>>>: Apache CXF\n<<<code>>>: MTOMHandler\n<<<explanation>>>: This code snippet shows how to use Apache CXF to parse MTOM/XOP SOAP responses. It creates a custom SOAPHandler that reads the SOAP body as an InputStream and parses it using a SAXParser. The parsing logic is left as a placeholder, you should implement it according to your needs.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>"}
