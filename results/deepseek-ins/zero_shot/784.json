To fix this, I moved the PrintWriter creation outside of the loop so it only gets created once. Then, I used the write method to append to the file instead of closing and reopening it with each iteration. This way, all the trials are written to the file.\nAlso, I added a line to print the average after the loop, because it was being calculated and printed inside the loop, which was causing it to only be printed once.\n$API\nPrintWriter.write\n\n\nA: The problem is that you are closing the file after each iteration. You should close it after the loop ends.\nHere is the corrected code:\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.io.PrintWriter;\nimport java.util.Scanner;\nimport java.io.File;\n\npublic class BottleCapPrize2{\n    public static void main (String[] args) throws IOException{\n        Scanner in = new Scanner (System.in);\n        System.out.print(\"Number of Trials: \");\n        int trials = in.nextInt();\n        int trialNumber = 0;\n        int total = 0;\n        int average = 0;\n        PrintWriter outFile = new PrintWriter(new File(\"bottleCap.txt\"));\n        for (int x = 0; x < trials; x++){\n            int counter = 0;\n            double randNum = Math.random();\n            trialNumber++;\n            while (randNum < 0.8){\n                counter ++;\n                randNum = Math.random();\n            }\n            total += counter;\n            average = (int) total/trials;\n            outFile.println(\"Trial \" + trialNumber + \" took \" + counter + \" drinks.\");\n        }\n        outFile.println(\"The average was \" + average);\n        outFile.close();\n    }\n}\n\nThis code will write all the trials to the file, and also print the average after all the trials.\n\nA: You are closing the file after each loop iteration.
