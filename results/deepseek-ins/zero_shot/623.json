Creating it takes about 50-55 seconds, so I decided to serialize it and save it to a file. Reading from the file takes about 16-17 seconds now.The only problem is that lookups seems to be slower this way. I always thought that the hashmap is read from the file into the memory, so the performance should be the same compared to the case when I create the hashmap myself, right?

The time complexity of this operation is O(1) on average, which means it takes constant time to retrieve a value from the map, regardless of the size of the map. This is because HashMap uses a technique called hashing to store and retrieve data. The hashing function determines the index where the data is stored in the array, and this index can be directly accessed to retrieve the data.\n\nIn your case, when you read the HashMap from the file, the time taken to retrieve values from the HashMap is likely to be slower than when you create the HashMap yourself. This is because the time taken to read the HashMap from the file is not constant, but depends on the size of the file and the speed of your disk. The time taken to retrieve values from the HashMap is also dependent on the size of the HashMap and the efficiency of the hashing algorithm used by the HashMap implementation.\n\nTo improve the performance of lookups, you could consider using a different data structure or algorithm that provides faster lookups. For example, a database or a cache could be used to store and retrieve the data more efficiently.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the time taken to read the HashMap from the file is likely to be slower than the time taken to create the HashMap yourself because the time taken to read the file is not constant, but depends on the size of the file and the speed of your disk.
