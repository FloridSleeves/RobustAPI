To get the rest of the string, we just convert the StringTokenizer back to a string using the toString() method.\n\n\nA: You can't get the remaining tokens from a StringTokenizer directly. However, you can create a new StringTokenizer starting from the current position.\nHere is an example:\nStringTokenizer sTokenizer = new StringTokenizer(expression);\n\n// consume some tokens\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    sTokenizer.nextToken();\n}\n\n// create a new StringTokenizer starting from the current position\nString restOfExpression = \"\";\nwhile (sTokenizer.hasMoreTokens()) {\n    restOfExpression += sTokenizer.nextToken();\n}\n\nSystem.out.println(restOfExpression);\n\nThis will give you the rest of the string starting from the nth token.\n\nA: You can't directly get the remaining tokens from a StringTokenizer.
