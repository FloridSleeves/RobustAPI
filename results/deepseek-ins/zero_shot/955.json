This is done in the following line of your client code:\n```java\nDatagramPacket sendPacket = new DatagramPacket(sendData, sendData.length, IPAddress, port);\nserverSocket.send(sendPacket);\n```\nIn this code, `serverSocket.send(sendPacket)` sends the response back to the client. If you want to allow the user to send multiple messages and then exit, you should modify your client code to not send a response after each message. Instead, you should send a response when the user wants to exit.\n\nHere's an example of how you can modify your client code:\n```java\nBufferedReader inFromUser = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\nDatagramSocket clientSocket = new DatagramSocket();\nInetAddress IPAddress = InetAddress.getByName(\"localhost\");\nbyte[] sendData = new byte[1024];\nbyte[] receiveData = new byte[1024];\n\nwhile (true) {\n    String sentence = inFromUser.readLine();\n    sendData = sentence.getBytes();\n    DatagramPacket sendPacket = new DatagramPacket(sendData, sendData.length, IPAddress, port);\n    clientSocket.send(sendPacket);\n\n    if (sentence.equalsIgnoreCase(\"exit\")) {\n        break;\n    }\n\n    DatagramPacket receivePacket = new DatagramPacket(receiveData, receiveData.length);\n    clientSocket.receive(receivePacket);\n    String modifiedSentence = new String(receivePacket.getData());\n    System.out.println(\"FROM SERVER:\" + modifiedSentence);\n}\n\nclientSocket.close();\n```\nIn this modified code, the client sends a message to the server and then checks if the message is \"exit\". If it is, the client breaks the loop and exits. If it's not, the client receives the server's response and prints it.\n\nPlease note that you should also modify your server code to handle the \"exit\" message and send a response back to the client.\n\nI hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n```java\nBufferedReader inFromUser = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\nDatagramSocket serverSocket = new DatagramSocket(port);\nbyte[] receiveData = new byte[1024];\nbyte[] sendData = new byte[1024];\n\nwhile (true) {\n    DatagramPacket receivePacket = new DatagramPacket(receiveData, receiveData.length);\n    serverSocket.receive(receivePacket);\n    String sentence = new String(receivePacket.getData());\n    SocketAddress address = receivePacket.getSocketAddress();\n    System.out.println(\"Received from \" + address + \" : \" + sentence);\n    InetAddress IPAddress = receivePacket.getAddress();\n    String capitalizedSentence = sentence.toUpperCase();\n    sendData = capitalizedSentence.getBytes();\n    DatagramPacket sendPacket = new DatagramPacket(sendData, sendData.length, IPAddress, port);\n    serverSocket.send(sendPacket);\n\n    if (sentence.equalsIgnoreCase(\"exit\")) {\n        break;\n    }\n}\n\nserverSocket.close();\n```\nIn this modified code, the server receives a message from the client, prints it, converts it to uppercase, sends the response back to the client, and then checks if the message is \"exit\". If it is, the server breaks the loop and exits. If it's not, the server continues to receive messages from the client.\n\nI hope this helps.
