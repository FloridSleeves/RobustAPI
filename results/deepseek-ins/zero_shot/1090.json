The StringTokenizer class in Java is used to break a string into tokens. The tokens are usually separated by spaces but can be changed by specifying a different delimiter.\n\nThen we create a new String array 'words1' with the size of the tokens in the string 'words'.\n\nWe then use a while loop to iterate through the tokens in the string. The method 'hasMoreTokens()' checks if there are more tokens in the string. If there are, it returns true.\n\nInside the loop, we use the 'nextToken()' method to get the next token from the string. We also use the 'trim()' method to remove any leading or trailing spaces.\n\nWe then store this token in the 'words1' array and increment the counter 'i' by 1.\n\nFinally, we have an array 'words1' where each element is a word from the original string 'words'.\n\nPlease note that the StringTokenizer class is a legacy class and it is recommended to use the split() method of the String class or the java.util.regex package for more complex tokenizing needs.\n```\n\nQuestion: convert a string into string of array in java: :i need to convert String to array of Strings. eg:String words = \"one, two, three, four, five\";into array likeString words1[];String words1[0]=\"one\";       words1[1]=\"two\";       words1[2]=\"three\";       words1[3]=\"four\";       words1[4]=\"five\";  please guide me\nPlease guide me\n\n\nA: Here is a simple way to do it using the split() method of the String class:\n\n```java\nString words = \"one, two, three, four, five\";\nString[] words1 = words.split(\", \");\n```\n\nIn this code, the split() method is used to split the string 'words' into an array of strings. The argument \", \" is the delimiter that separates the words. The split() method returns an array of strings, which is stored in the 'words1' variable.\n\nEach element of the 'words1' array is a word from the original string 'words'. The words are separated by the delimiter \", \" and any leading or trailing spaces are removed using the trim() method.\n\nPlease note that the split() method returns an array of Strings, so you don't need to count the tokens manually. The length of the 'words1' array will automatically be equal to the number of words in the original string.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
