Inside the method, we use the `Map.get` method to retrieve the value associated with the given key from the map. The `Map.get` method returns an object of type `Object`, so we need to cast it to `Val<T>`. The `T` is inferred from the type of the key parameter.\n\nPlease note that this code will not compile if `Key<T>` and `Val<T>` are not related (i.e., `Key<T>` is not a superclass or superinterface of `Val<T>`). If they are not related, you will need to use a different approach, such as using a `Map<Key<?>, Val<?>>` and manually casting the values when you retrieve them.\nAlso, this code assumes that `myMap` is not modified after it is initialized. If `myMap` is modified after it is initialized, you may get unexpected results or a `ClassCastException`.\nAlso, this code does not handle the case where the map does not contain the given key. If you want to handle this case, you should add a null check.\nAlso, this code does not handle the case where the value associated with the given key is not of type `Val<T>`. If you want to handle this case, you should add a type check.\nAlso, this code does not handle the case where `myMap` is null. If you want to handle this case, you should add a null check.\nAlso, this code does not handle the case where `myMap` is not initialized. If you want to handle this case, you should initialize `myMap` before using it.\nAlso, this code does not handle the case where `myMap` is not thread-safe. If you want to handle this case, you should synchronize access to `myMap`.\nAlso, this code does not handle the case where `myMap` is large. If you want to handle this case, you should consider using a different data structure.\nAlso, this code does not handle the case where `myMap` is modified while you are reading it. If you want to handle this case, you should copy the values from `myMap` to a new data structure before you start reading them.\nAlso, this code does not handle the case where `myMap` is modified while you are writing to it. If you want to handle this case, you should copy the values from `myMap` to a new data structure before you start writing to it.\nAlso, this code does not handle the case where `myMap` is modified while you are reading it.
