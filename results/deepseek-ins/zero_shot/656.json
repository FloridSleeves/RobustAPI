You can iterate over them to access the individual bug/fault information.\n\nA: You can cast the object to a HashMap and then use the get method to retrieve the 'bugs' and 'faults' arrays.\nHere is an example:\nObject createResult = rpcClient.execute(\"Bug.search\", new Object[]{bugMap});\nHashMap resultMap = (HashMap) createResult;\nObject bugs = resultMap.get(\"bugs\");\nObject faults = resultMap.get(\"faults\");\n\n'bugs' and 'faults' are arrays of HashMaps, each representing a bug or fault. You can iterate over them to access the individual bug/fault information.\n\nA: If you are using the xmlrpc library, you can cast the result to the appropriate type. In your case, you should cast it to an Array of HashMaps. Here's an example:\nObject createResult = rpcClient.execute(\"Bug.search\", new Object[]{bugMap});\nHashMap[] resultArray = (HashMap[]) createResult;\n\nNow you can iterate over the resultArray to access the individual bug/fault information. Each HashMap in the array represents a bug or fault. You can access the data in each HashMap by using the get method, like this:\nfor (HashMap bug : resultArray) {\n    String summary = (String) bug.get(\"summary\");\n    int bugId = (Integer) bug.get(\"id\");\n    // ...\n}\n\nThis will give you the summary and id of each bug in the resultArray. You can replace \"summary\" and \"id\" with the actual keys you want to access.\n\nA: If you are using the xmlrpc library, you can cast the result to the appropriate type.
