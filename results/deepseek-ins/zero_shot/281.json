My professor send us a JUnit test so we can know if our code is working correctly. Now every method has passed the test except the iterator test which fails the test. It appears to be a java.lang.AssertionError and I cant seem to figure out a way of fixing it. If you could see the error and point it out to me would be awesome.

If the iteration has no more elements, it will throw a java.util.NoSuchElementException. To avoid this, you can check if there are more elements in the iterator before calling next() like this:\n```java\nIterator<Contact> iterator = contacts.iterator();\nif (iterator.hasNext()) {\n    Contact contact = iterator.next();\n} else {\n    // Handle the case when there are no more elements\n}\n```\nThis way, you can avoid the AssertionError.\n\nQuestion: What is the problem with the following code?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nIterator<Contact> iterator = contacts.iterator();\nContact contact = iterator.next();\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: This code is used to get the next element in the iterator.
