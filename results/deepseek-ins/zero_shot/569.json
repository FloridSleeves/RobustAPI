Then, we get the first student's id and set it as the minimum id. Then, we iterate through the list. If we find a student with an id less than the current minimum, we update the minimum.\nThis way, we ensure that we get the minimum id from the list.\n\nA: You can use Java 8's Stream API to find the minimum student id. Here is how you can do it:\n\n```java\nint minId = students.stream()\n                    .mapToInt(Student::getId)\n                    .min()\n                    .orElseThrow(() -> new RuntimeException(\"No students in the list\"));\n```\n\nIn this code, we first map each Student object to its id using the `mapToInt(Student::getId)` function. Then we find the minimum id using the `min()` function. If the list is empty, `orElseThrow()` will throw a RuntimeException.\n\nThis code does exactly the same as the previous code you provided, but it's more concise and readable.\n\nPlease note that this code will throw a RuntimeException if the list is empty. If you don't want to handle this case, you can use `orElse(Integer.MAX_VALUE)` instead of `orElseThrow()`.\n\nAlso, remember that this code uses Java 8's Stream API, so it won't work in older versions of Java.\n\nA: You can use Java 8's Stream API to find the minimum student id.
