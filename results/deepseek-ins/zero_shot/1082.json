It is a part of java.util package. The nextToken() method of StringTokenizer class is used to get the next token. In your case, you are using this method to get the next token from the string 'line'. The token is then parsed into an integer using Integer.parseInt(). This is done for each token (x, y, z) in your string.\nThe error you were getting was because you were trying to treat a string as if it was an array. The StringTokenizer class is used to break a string into tokens, so it can be used to break a string into individual numbers.\nClosed.\n\nA: You can use the StringTokenizer class in Java to parse numbers in a string. Here is an example:\nString line = \"34 55 64\";\nStringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(line);\nint x = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\nint y = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\nint z = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\n\nIn this code, we first create a StringTokenizer object with the string \"34 55 64\" as the argument. The StringTokenizer class is used to break the string into tokens. The nextToken() method is then used to get each token (in this case, the numbers \"34\", \"55\", and \"64\") from the string. These tokens are then parsed into integers using the Integer.parseInt() method.\nThe variables x, y, and z will now hold the values 34, 55, and 64, respectively.\n\nA: You can use the split() method of the String class to split your string into an array of substrings. Then you can parse each substring into an integer. Here is an example:\nString line = \"34 55 64\";\nString[] numbers = line.split(\" \");\nint x = Integer.parseInt(numbers[0]);\nint y = Integer.parseInt(numbers[1]);\nint z = Integer.parseInt(numbers[2]);\n\nIn this code, the split() method is used to split the string \"line\" into an array of substrings based on the space character. The resulting array, \"numbers\", contains the numbers \"34\", \"55\", and \"64\". Then, each substring is parsed into an integer using the Integer.parseInt() method, and the resulting integers are stored in the variables x, y, and z.\n\nA: You can use the split() method of the String class to parse numbers in a string.
