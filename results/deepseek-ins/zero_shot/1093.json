The first part is the row number and the second part is the column number. We then convert these parts into integers using Integer.parseInt() and assign them to the row and column variables.\n\nNote: The scan.next() method will read the input as a string and then we use StringTokenizer to split the string into two parts.\n\nThis way, we can easily ignore hyphens while getting the input from the user.\n\nAlso, please note that this code assumes that the user will always provide input in the format \"row-column\". If the user enters something else, the code will throw an exception.\n\nAlso, please note that the StringTokenizer class is deprecated in Java 9 and onwards. If you are using Java 9 or later, you should consider using the split() method of the String class or the Scanner class with a delimiter.\n\nI hope this helps. Let me know if you have any further questions.\n\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: StringTokenizer\n<<<code>>>: \nString input = scan.next();\nStringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(input,\"-\");\nrow = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\ncolumn = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\n<<<explanation>>>: In this code, we are using StringTokenizer to split the input string into two parts based on the hyphen.
