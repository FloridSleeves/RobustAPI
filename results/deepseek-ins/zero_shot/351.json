I think that there should be a for loop and it should be iterating through MultiMap. The lowest key should be the highest priority, so in C++ I would set a pointer to the first element and increment it.

We then get an iterator for this set. The next() method of the iterator returns the next element in the iteration. We store this in the lowestKey variable. We then remove the entry from the multimap using the remove() method, passing in the lowestKey and the iterator for the values associated with this key. The iterator for the values is obtained by calling the get() method on the multimap and passing in the lowestKey, which returns a collection of values associated with this key. We then get an iterator for this collection and call the next() method to get the first value associated with this key. This value is then removed from the multimap.\n\nNote: This code assumes that the multimap contains at least one entry. If the multimap could be empty, you should check if the iterator has a next element before calling next() on it.\n\nAlso, this code removes the first occurrence of the lowest key. If you want to remove all occurrences of the lowest key, you should call the remove() method in a loop until it returns false.\n\nFinally, this code does not handle the case where the multimap contains multiple keys with the same lowest value. If you want to handle this case, you should keep track of the lowest key and remove all entries with this key.\n\nPlease note that this code does not implement a priority queue. A priority queue is a data structure that allows you to insert elements and retrieve the element with the highest priority (lowest key in this case). This code only removes the element with the lowest key.\n\nIf you want to implement a priority queue, you should use a data structure that allows you to retrieve the element with the highest priority in constant time, such as a heap or a priority queue implemented with a binary search tree.\n\nPlease note that this code uses the Guava library, which is not part of the Java standard library. If you are not using Guava, you will need to implement your own priority queue.\n\nAlso, this code assumes that the values associated with the keys are unique. If the values are not unique, you will need to modify the code to handle this case.\n\nPlease note that this code does not handle the case where the multimap contains multiple keys with the same lowest value.
