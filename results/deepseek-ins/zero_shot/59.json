It checks if the line starts with \"#\" to ignore comments. If the line is not a comment, it splits the line into key and value using \"=\" as the delimiter. If the line is split into two parts, it adds the key and value to a HashMap. The HashMap is used because it allows constant time complexity for basic operations like get and put. The keys and values are trimmed to remove any leading or trailing spaces. The properties can be accessed using the get method of the HashMap.\n```\n\nA: I'm building a RMI game and the client would load a file that has some keys and values which are going to be used on several different objects.

I've tried different approaches but so far nothing came close to the results that I would had using java.util.Properties. Any idea?\n\nAnswer:\nYou can use a `BufferedReader` to read the file line by line, and then split each line into key-value pairs. You can ignore lines that start with '#' or are empty. Here's a simple example:\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        FileReader fileReader = new FileReader(\"file.txt\");\n        BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(fileReader);\n\n        Map<String, String> properties = new HashMap<>();\n\n        String line;\n        while ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) {\n            if (!line.startsWith(\"#\") && line.contains(\"=\")) {\n                String[] keyValue = line.split(\"=\");\n                properties.put(keyValue[0].trim(), keyValue[1].trim());\n            }\n        }\n        bufferedReader.close();\n\n        System.out.println(properties.get(\"BioplayerOrigin\"));\n        System.out.println(properties.get(\"playerClass\"));\n        // and so on...\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, we read the file line by line using `BufferedReader.readLine()`. We ignore lines that start with '#' or do not contain '=' as they are either comments or not key-value pairs. We then split each line into key and value using '=' as the delimiter. We add these key-value pairs to a `HashMap`. The keys and values are trimmed to remove any leading or trailing spaces. You can access the properties using the `get` method of the `HashMap`.\n\nThis code assumes that"}
