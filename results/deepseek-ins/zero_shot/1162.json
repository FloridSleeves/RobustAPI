In this case, we are using it to break the line read from the BufferedReader into tokens. The tokens are the numbers that we want to use in the Graph.checkForCycle() method. We are skipping the first token (which is the text) and only taking the last three tokens (which are the numbers). We are storing these tokens in separate variables (token1, token2, token3, and token4) and then using these variables to call the Graph.checkForCycle() method. The last three tokens are the ones we want to use in the method, so we are passing token4, token3, and token2 as arguments.\n\nA: Here is the corrected code:\nStringTokenizer st1 = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\nString token1 = st1.nextToken(); // skip the first token\nString token2 = st1.nextToken(); // get the third token\nString token3 = st1.nextToken(); // get the fourth token\nGraph.checkForCycle(null, Integer.parseInt(token3), Integer.parseInt(token2), Integer.parseInt(token1));\n\nIn this code, we are using StringTokenizer to break the line read from the BufferedReader into tokens.

The last three tokens are the ones we want to use in the method, so we are passing token3, token2, and token1 as arguments.\n\nPlease note that the order of the arguments in the Graph.checkForCycle() method call is important. The order should be the reverse of the order in which the tokens were read. In this case, we are passing token3, token2, and token1 as arguments, so the order of the arguments in the Graph.checkForCycle() method call should be (token3, token2, token1).\n\nI hope this helps. Let me know if you have any further questions.\n\nA: Here is the corrected code:\nStringTokenizer st1 = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\nString token1 = st1.nextToken(); // skip the first token\nString token2 = st1.nextToken(); // get the second token\nString token3 = st1.nextToken(); // get the third token\nString token4 = st1.nextToken(); // get the fourth token\nGraph.checkForCycle(null, Integer.parseInt(token3), Integer.parseInt(token2), Integer.parseInt(token1));\n\nIn this code, we are using StringTokenizer to break the line read from the BufferedReader into tokens.
