I have initialized the hashmap with keys from 0-51 and the values are array of Card, as followsCard [] card = new Card[52]for (int i=1; i<=13; i++)    for (int j=0; j<4; j++)        card[++index] = new Card( ((i*10)+j) );and I populate the hashmap as follows:for (int i=1; i<=13; i++)    for (int j=0; j<4; j++)        deck.put( ++key, card[++index] );Now, what I want to do is to shuffle the values side of the hashmap, i do not want,for an example, the key[1] corresponds to card[0] and key[1] corresponds to card[1]. I want, for an exampel, the key[1] corresponds to card[38]. I want the values side to be shuffled. I tried the following:Collections.shuffle(card,new Random()); But it seems it accepts only ArrayList and List. \nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to shuffle a deck of cards using Java (trying to use hashmap, not working)?: :I have a hashmap<Integer, Card> Card is a class.

The values() method of the HashMap class returns a Collection view of the values contained in this map. The shuffle method from the Collections class is then used to shuffle this collection.\n\n\nA: You can use the values() method of the HashMap to get a Collection of the values, and then shuffle that Collection. Here's how you can do it:\nList<Card> cards = new ArrayList<>(deck.values());\nCollections.shuffle(cards, new Random());\n\nNow, cards is a shuffled list of the cards in your deck. If you want to replace the old values in your HashMap with the shuffled ones, you can do this:\nint i = 0;\nfor (Iterator<Card> it = cards.iterator(); it.hasNext(); i++) {\n    deck.put(i, it.next());\n}\n\nThis will replace the old values in your HashMap with the shuffled ones.\n\nA: You can use the values() method of the HashMap to get a Collection of the values, and then shuffle that Collection.
