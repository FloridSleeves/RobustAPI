However, you will need to manually manage the cipher initialization vector (IV) and ensure that the IV is stored with the encrypted data.\n\nHere's a simple example of how you can use `CipherOutputStream` to append to an AES encrypted file:\n\n```java\nimport javax.crypto.Cipher;\nimport javax.crypto.CipherOutputStream;\nimport javax.crypto.spec.IvParameterSpec;\nimport javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;\nimport java.io.File;\nimport java.io.FileOutputStream;\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.io.OutputStream;\nimport java.security.GeneralSecurityException;\nimport java.security.SecureRandom;\n\npublic class AppendToEncryptedFile {\n    private static final String KEY = \"Bar12345Bar12345\"; // 128 bit key\n    private static final String INIT_VECTOR = \"RandomInitVector\"; // 16 bytes IV\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, GeneralSecurityException {\n        File file = new File(\"encrypted.txt\");\n        OutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream(file, true); // append mode\n\n        SecretKeySpec secretKey = new SecretKeySpec(KEY.getBytes(), \"AES\");\n        IvParameterSpec ivParameterSpec = new IvParameterSpec(INIT_VECTOR.getBytes());\n\n        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/NoPadding\");\n        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secretKey, ivParameterSpec);\n\n        CipherOutputStream cipherOutputStream = new CipherOutputStream(outputStream, cipher);\n\n        String message = \"Hello, world!\";\n        cipherOutputStream.write(message.getBytes());\n\n        cipherOutputStream.close();\n        outputStream.close();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we're using the `CipherOutputStream` to append to the encrypted file. We're using the `AES/CBC/NoPadding` cipher transformation, which allows us to append to the file without having to decrypt it. We're also using a 128-bit key and a 16-byte initialization vector.\n\nPlease note that you should store the initialization vector (IV) with the encrypted data. This is necessary because the IV is used to encrypt the first block of data, and without it, you won't be able to decrypt the data.\n\nAlso, be aware that the `NoPadding` option can only be used if you control the size of the output data and ensure that it is divisible by the block size. If you're appending data that is not a multiple of the block size, you will need to add padding to the data to make it a multiple of the block size.\n\nI hope this helps clarify how to use `CipherOutputStream` to append to an AES encrypted file without having to decrypt it every time.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n"}
