When you call removeUser.remove(key) inside the loop, it modifies the underlying Map and hence the Iterator becomes invalid. The next time you call Iterator.next(), it throws ConcurrentModificationException.\n\nTo avoid this, you should use an Iterator to remove elements from the Map. Here is how you can modify your code:\n\n```java\nIterator<String> iterator = keySet.iterator();\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\n    String key = iterator.next();\n    User user = removeUser.get(key);\n    if (!user.isActive()) {\n        iterator.remove();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, the Iterator.remove() method is used to safely remove elements from the underlying Map while iterating over it.\n\nAlternatively, you can use Java 8's forEachRemaining() method to remove elements from the Map:\n\n```java\nkeySet.iterator().forEachRemaining(key -> {\n    User user = removeUser.get(key);\n    if (!user.isActive()) {\n        removeUser.remove(key);\n    }\n});\n```\n\nIn this code, forEachRemaining() is used to iterate over the remaining elements in the Iterator and remove the ones that are not active.\n\nBoth of these solutions avoid the ConcurrentModificationException by safely removing elements from the Map during iteration.\n\nPlease note that both solutions will work with both HashMap and Hashtable.\n\nAlso, if you are using Java 9 or later, you can use the forEach method to iterate over the Map:\n\n```java\nremoveUser.keySet().removeIf(key -> !removeUser.get(key).isActive());\n```\n\nIn this code, the removeIf() method is used to remove elements from the Map based on a Predicate. The Predicate checks if the User is not active.\n\nThis solution will work with both HashMap and Hashtable.\n<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nIterator<String> iterator = keySet.iterator();\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\n    String key = iterator.next();\n    User user = removeUser.get(key);\n    if (!user.isActive()) {\n        iterator.remove();\n    }\n}\n```\nor\n```java\nremoveUser.keySet().removeIf(key -> !removeUser.get(key).isActive());\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: These solutions avoid the ConcurrentModificationException by safely removing elements from the Map during iteration. They work with both HashMap and Hashtable.\n\nPlease note that the second solution is more concise and readable, but the first one might be more suitable if you are using an older version of Java.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
