The file data is sent in the body of the request, and the Content-Type is set to \"multipart/form-data\" to indicate that the file data is being sent as part of a form submission. The file data is sent in chunks of bytes, and the size of each chunk is limited by the bufferSize variable. The file data is sent after a boundary string, which is also sent in the Content-Type header. The file name and type are also sent in the request.\nPlease note that you need to replace \"http://your_tomcat_server_url/your_servlet_url\" with your actual server url and servlet url. Also, you need to replace \"fileName\", \"fileType\" and \"file\" with your actual file name, file type and file object respectively.\nAlso, remember to handle exceptions properly in your code.\n```\n\nPlease note that this code is a basic example and may not cover all edge cases.
