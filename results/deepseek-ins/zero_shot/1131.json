For each line, it uses a StringTokenizer to tokenize the line by the newline character \"\\n\". The tokens are then printed to the console. The FileInputStream, BufferedReader, and StringTokenizer are all part of the Java API. The FileInputStream is used to read from a file, BufferedReader is used to read text from a character-input stream, and StringTokenizer is used to break a string into tokens.\n\nPlease note that the method readFromFile() will read the file line by line, so it will print each line of the file separately. If you want to read the file as a whole, you should use a different method.\n\nAlso, make sure that the file \"cars.txt\" exists in the specified location and that you have the necessary read permissions for the file.\n\nFinally, remember to handle exceptions properly in your code. In this case, I've used a try-catch block to handle any exceptions that might occur while reading from the file. The finally block is used to ensure that the file streams are closed, even if an exception is thrown.\n\nI hope this helps you understand how to read from a file that you wrote using PrintWriter, BufferedWriter, and FileWriter.\n\nNote: The code provided in the question is incorrect because it tries to read a single character from the file using the read() method of the InputStreamReader, which is not suitable for reading lines from a file. The readLine() method of the BufferedReader class should be used instead.\n\nI hope this helps you understand how to read from a file that you wrote using PrintWriter, BufferedWriter, and FileWriter.\n\nNote: The code provided in the question is incorrect because it tries to read a single character from the file using the read() method of the InputStreamReader, which is not suitable for reading lines from a file.
