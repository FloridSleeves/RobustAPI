I tried using the Double.parseDouble(name); method, but when it runs, it doesn't work right. What should I use?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: StringTokenizer\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nString name = \"John 20150.00\";\nStringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(name);\nString namePart = st.nextToken();\nString numberPart = st.nextToken();\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: In this code, we use the StringTokenizer class to break up the string into two parts. The first part is the name, which we store in the variable namePart. The second part is the number, which we store in the variable numberPart. The StringTokenizer class works by splitting the string into tokens based on spaces.\n```\n\nQuestion: How to get the last element of an array in Java:\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Array.length\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint lastElement = array[array.length - 1];\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: In Java, you can get the length of an array using the length property. This property returns the number of elements in the array. To get the last element of the array, you can use the length property to find the index of the last element, which is length - 1.\n```\n\nQuestion: How to convert a string to an integer in Java:\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Integer.parseInt\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nString str = \"123\";\nint num = Integer.parseInt(str);\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: In Java, you can convert a string to an integer using the Integer.parseInt method. This method takes a string as an argument and returns an integer. If the string cannot be converted to an integer, the method will throw a NumberFormatException.\n```\n\nQuestion: How to sort an array in Java:\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Arrays.sort\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nint[] array = {5, 2, 8, 3, 1};\nArrays.sort(array);\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: In Java, you can sort an array using the Arrays.sort method. This method sorts the elements of the array in ascending order. The sort method uses a Dual-Pivot Quicksort by Vladimir Yaroslavskiy, Jon Bentley, and Joshua Bloch.\n```\n\nQuestion: How to find the maximum value in an array in Java:\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nint[] array = {5, 2, 8, 3, 1};\nint max = Arrays.stream(array).max().getAsInt();\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: In Java, you can find the maximum value in an array using the Arrays.stream method. This method converts the array into a Stream. Then, you can use the max method to find the maximum value in the stream. The getAsInt method is used to get the integer value of the maximum.\n```\n\nQuestion: How to find the minimum value in an array in Java:\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nint[] array = {5, 2, 8, 3, 1};\nint min = Arrays.stream(array).min().getAsInt();\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: In Java, you can find the minimum value in an array using the Arrays.stream method. This method converts the array into a Stream. Then, you can use the min method to find the minimum value in the stream. The getAsInt method is used to get the integer value of the minimum.\n```\n\nQuestion: How to create a new array from an existing array in Java:\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Arrays.copyOf\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nint[] oldArray = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint[] newArray = Arrays.copyOf(oldArray, oldArray.length);\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: In Java, you can create a new array from an existing array using the Arrays.copyOf method. This method creates a new array and copies the elements from the existing array into the new array. The first argument is the existing array, and the second argument is the length"}
