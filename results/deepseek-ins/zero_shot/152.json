If the contents of the files are different, it returns false. If it reads to the end of both files without finding any differences, it returns true. This code does not have any race conditions because it does not use shared mutable state. It only reads from the input streams and compares the read bytes.\n\nNote: This code assumes that the files are not too large to fit into memory. If they are, you would need to use a different approach to read the files.\n\nAlso, this code does not handle the case where one file is shorter than the other. You would need to add code to handle that case.\n\nFinally, this code does not close the input streams. You would need to add code to close the input streams when you are done with them.\n\nThis code does not handle any exceptions that might occur while reading the files. You would need to add code to handle those exceptions.\n\nThis code does not handle the case where the files are not seekable. If the files are not seekable, you would need to use a different approach to read the files.\n\nThis code does not handle the case where the files are not regular files. If the files are not regular files, you would need to use a different approach to read the files.\n\nThis code does not handle the case where the files are not accessible. If the files are not accessible, you would need to use a different approach to read the files.\n\nThis code does not handle the case where the files are not readable. If the files are not readable, you would need to use a different approach to read the files.\n\nThis code does not handle the case where the files are not writable. If the files are not writable, you would need to use a different approach to read the files.\n\nThis code does not handle the case where the files are not executable. If the files are not executable, you would need to use a different approach to read the files.\n\nThis code does not handle the case where the files are not hidden. If the files are not hidden, you would need to use a different approach to read the files.\n\nThis code does not handle the case where the files are not temporary. If the files are not temporary, you would need to use a different approach to read the files.\n\nThis code does not handle the case where the files are not a directory. If the files are not a directory, you would need to use a different approach to read the files.\n\nThis code does not handle the case where the files are not a symbolic link. If the files are not a symbolic link, you would need to use a different approach to read the files.\n\nThis code does not handle the case where the files are not a block special file. If the files are not a block special file, you would need to use a different approach to read the files.\n\nThis code does not handle the case where the files are not a character special file. If the files are not a character special file, you would need to use a different approach to read the files.\n\nThis code does not handle the case where the files are not a named pipe. If the files are not a named pipe, you would need to use a different approach to read the files.\n\nThis code does not handle the case where the files are not a socket. If the files are not a socket, you would need to use a different approach to read the files.\n\nThis code does not handle the case where the files are not a door. If the files are not a door, you would need to use a different approach to read the files.\n\nThis code does not handle the case where the files are not a whiteout. If the files are not a whiteout, you would need to use a different approach to read the files.\n\nThis code does not handle"}
