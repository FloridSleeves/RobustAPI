Has anyone found an elegant solution?Specific Use-CaseMy use-case is that I have a mobile app that is generating large amounts of JSON (and some binary data in some cases but to a lesser extent) and compressing the requests saves a large amount of bandwidth. I am using Tomcat as my Servlet container. I am using Spring for its MVC annotations primarily just to abstract away some of the JEE stuff into a much cleaner, annotation-based interface. I also use Jackson for auto (de)serialization.I also use nginx, but I am not sure if thats where I want the decompression to take place. The nginx nodes simply balance the requests which are then distributed through the data center. It would be just as nice to keep it compressed until it actually got to the node that was going to process it.Thanks in advance,JohnEDIT:The discussion between myself and @DaSourcerer was really helpful for those that are curious about the state of things at the time of writing this.I ended up implementing a solution of my own.

If it is, the filter wraps the original request with a GzipRequestWrapper that decompresses the gzip-compressed body of the request. The decompressed body is stored in a byte array and can be read from it in the getInputStream() method of the wrapper. The filter then passes the wrapped request along with the original response to the next filter in the chain. If the \"Content-Encoding\" header is not set to \"gzip\", the filter simply passes the original request and response along to the next filter in the chain.\n\nThis solution is based on the assumption that the client is always sending gzip-compressed requests. If the client might send uncompressed requests, the filter should be modified to check for the \"Content-Encoding\" header and only wrap the request if it is set to \"gzip\".\n\nNote that this solution uses the Apache Commons IO library to read the entire compressed input stream into a byte array. This is necessary because the GZIPInputStream class does not support mark/reset, which is required to decompress the entire input stream without buffering it all in memory.\n\nAlso note that this solution does not handle the case where the client sends a gzip-compressed request with a different \"Content-Type\" than \"application/json\". If the client might send such requests, the filter should be modified to only decompress requests with a \"Content-Type\" of \"application/json\" and a \"Content-Encoding\" of \"gzip\".\n\nFinally, this solution does not handle the case where the client sends a gzip-compressed request with a different \"Content-Encoding\" than \"gzip\". If the client might send such requests, the filter should be modified to only decompress requests with a \"Content-Encoding\" of \"gzip\".\n\nIn conclusion, this solution is a"}
