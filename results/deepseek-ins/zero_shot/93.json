You need to use HttpServletResponse's underlying OutputStream directly.\n\nA: You can't send trailers in a chunked response using DataOutputStream.write. You need to use HttpServletResponse's underlying OutputStream directly.\n\nHere is an example of how you can do it:\n\n```java\nprotected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {\n    response.setHeader(\"Transfer-Encoding\", \"chunked\");\n    response.setHeader(\"Trailer\", \"SomeTrailer\");\n    response.setContentType(\"text/plain\");\n\n    PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(response.getOutputStream()), true);\n\n    out.println(\"7\");\n    out.println(\"Hello, \");\n    out.println(\"world!\");\n    out.println(\"0\");\n    out.println(\"SomeTrailer: value\");\n    out.flush();\n}\n```\n\nThis will send a chunked response with a trailer. The first chunk contains the string \"Hello, \", the second chunk contains the string \"world!\" and the last chunk is empty. The trailer \"SomeTrailer: value\" is sent after the last chunk.\n\nPlease note that the chunked encoding is a complex topic and it's not always possible to send trailers in a chunked response. The HTTP specification allows trailers only in chunked encoding, but not all clients support it.\n\nAlso, note that the chunked encoding is not compatible with the Content-Length header. If you use chunked encoding, you should not set the Content-Length header.\n\nIf you want to send trailers in a non-chunked response, you can simply set the trailer header after you've written the response body. However, keep in mind that not all clients will parse the trailer header correctly.\n\n```java\nprotected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {\n    response.setContentType(\"text/plain\");\n\n    PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(response.getOutputStream()), true);\n\n    out.println(\"Hello, \");\n    out.println(\"world!\");\n    out.flush();\n\n    response.setHeader(\"Trailer\", \"SomeTrailer\");\n    response.setHeader(\"SomeTrailer\", \"value\");\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, the trailer \"SomeTrailer: value\" is sent after the response body.\n\nI hope this helps.
