This method returns the next element in the iteration and advances the iterator. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Iterator;\nimport java.util.stream.Stream;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Stream<String> stream = Stream.of(\"s0\", \"s1\", \"s2\", \"s3\", \"s4\");\n        Iterator<String> iterator = stream.iterator();\n\n        String[] extracted = new String[2];\n        extracted[0] = iterator.next(); // Extract element at position 0\n        extracted[1] = iterator.next(); // Extract element at position 1\n\n        System.out.println(extracted[0]); // Prints: s0\n        System.out.println(extracted[1]); // Prints: s1\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, we first create a Stream of Strings. Then, we convert this Stream to an Iterator using the `iterator()` method. We can then use the `next()` method of the Iterator to extract the elements at positions 0 and 1. The elements are stored in the `extracted` array.\n\nPlease note that the `next()` method of an Iterator throws a `NoSuchElementException` if there are no more elements in the iteration. So, ensure that the stream has enough elements to extract the elements at the specified positions.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that the stream can be made sequential using methods like `sequential()` if it's currently parallel.\n\nThis approach allows you to extract elements from a Stream by their positions without the need for any intermediate operations like `skip()` or `peek()`.\n\nThis is a common pattern in Java 8 and later, where you can use the Iterator interface to directly access elements from a Stream.\n\n<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: String[] extracted = new String[2]; extracted[0] = iterator.next(); extracted[1] = iterator.next();\n<<<explanation>>>: The `next()` method of an Iterator is used to extract elements from a Stream by their positions.
