Thank you!\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: coolFile.write(\"Why isn't this adding another line?\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The PrintWriter.write method is used to write a string to the file. It does not automatically add a new line at the end of the string. You can add a new line by using PrintWriter.println or PrintWriter.write(\"\\n\").\n\nCode:\n```java\nimport java.io.FileWriter;\nimport java.io.PrintWriter;\npublic class DemoPrint {\n    public static void main (String args []) {\n        try{\n            PrintWriter coolFile = new PrintWriter(\"c:\\\\JavaIO\\\\cool.txt\");\n            coolFile.write(\"Why isn't this adding another line?\");\n            coolFile.write(\"\\n\"); // This adds a new line\n            coolFile.close();\n        }\n        catch (Exception e) {\n            System.out.println(\"Error\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nExplanation: In the code above, we are using the PrintWriter.write method to write the string \"Why isn't this adding another line?\" to the file. We then use PrintWriter.write(\"\\n\") to add a new line. The file is then closed with coolFile.close().\n```\n\nA: The issue is that you are creating a new FileWriter object and passing it to the PrintWriter constructor. This is causing the PrintWriter to overwrite the file instead of appending to it. To append to the file, you should only create one FileWriter and pass it to the PrintWriter. Here is the corrected code:\n\n```java\nimport java.io.FileWriter;\nimport java.io.PrintWriter;\npublic class DemoPrint {\n    public static void main (String args []) {\n        try{\n            FileWriter file = new FileWriter(\"c:\\\\JavaIO\\\\cool.txt\", true);\n            PrintWriter coolFile = new PrintWriter(file);\n            coolFile.println(\"Why isn't this adding another line?\");\n            coolFile.close();\n        }\n        catch (Exception e) {\n            System.out.println(\"Error\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, we create a FileWriter object with the second parameter set to true, which tells it to append to the file instead of overwriting it. We then pass this FileWriter to the PrintWriter constructor. This way, the PrintWriter will append to the file instead of overwriting it.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
