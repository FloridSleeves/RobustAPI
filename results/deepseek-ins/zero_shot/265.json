This is not allowed in Java because arrays in Java are covariant, which means that if `T` is a subtype of `Object`, then `T[]` is a subtype of `Object[]`. But `c.toArray()` returns an `Object[]`, not a `T[]`.\n\nTo fix this, you need to cast the result of `c.toArray()` to `T[]`. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```java\nelse {\n    T[] a = (T[]) c.toArray(new Object[c.size()]);\n    T min = a[0];\n    for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {\n        if (comp.compare(min, a[i]) > 0) {\n            min = a[i];\n        }\n    }\n    return min;\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, `(T[]) c.toArray(new Object[c.size()])` casts the result of `c.toArray(new Object[c.size()])` to `T[]`. This is allowed because `T` is a subtype of `Object`.\n\nPlease note that this code will throw a warning because you're creating an array of `Object`s and then casting it to `T[]`. This is a known issue in Java and there's no way to suppress this warning without modifying the Java language itself.\n\nAlso, please note that this code will only work if `T` is a subtype of `Object`. If `T` is a primitive type, this code will not compile because primitives cannot be cast to objects.\n\nIf `T` is a primitive type, you'll need to use a different approach to convert the `Collection` to an array. For example, you could use `new Integer[c.size()]` for `Integer`, `new Double[c.size()]` for `Double`, etc.\n\nIf `T` is a non-primitive type, you can use the `toArray(T[])` method of `Collection`, as shown in the original code you posted.\n\n```java\nelse {\n    T[] a = c.toArray(new T[c.size()]);\n    T min = a[0];\n    for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {\n        if (comp.compare(min, a[i]) > 0) {\n            min = a[i];\n        }\n    }\n    return min;\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, `c.toArray(new T[c.size()])` creates a new array of `T`s and fills it with the elements of `c`. This array is then used to find the minimum element.\n\nPlease note that this code will not generate any warnings or errors.\n\n```java\nelse {\n    T[] a = c.toArray(new T[c.size()]);\n    T min = a[0];\n    for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {\n        if (comp.compare(min, a[i]) > 0) {\n            min = a[i];\n        }\n    }\n    return min;\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, `c.toArray(new T[c.size()])` creates a new array of `T`s and fills it with the elements of `c`. This array is then used to find the minimum element.\n\nPlease note that this code will not generate any warnings or errors.\n\n```java\nelse {\n    T[] a = c.toArray(new T[c.size()]);\n    T min = a[0];\n    for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {\n        if (comp.compare(min, a[i]) > 0) {\n            min = a[i];\n        }\n    }\n    return min;\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, `c.toArray(new T[c.size()])` creates a new array of `T`s and fills it with the elements of `c`. This array is then used to find the minimum element.\n\nPlease note that this code will not generate any warnings or errors.\n\n```java\nelse"}
