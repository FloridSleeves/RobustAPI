The loop continues until `read()` returns -1, which indicates the end of the stream.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the input is text and not binary data. If the input is binary data, you should use a different approach to read it.\n\nAlso, this solution does not handle errors that might occur when reading from the stream. In a real-world application, you should handle these errors appropriately.\n\nFinally, this solution does not handle the case where the input is not a text stream. If the input is not a text stream, you should use a different approach to read it.\n\nPlease note that this solution is for Windows cmd.exe.
