Then for each byte, `Integer.toBinaryString(b & 0xFF)` is used to convert it to a binary string. The `String.format(\"%8s\", ...)` is used to ensure each binary string has 8 digits by padding with zeros if necessary. The `replace(' ', '0')` is used to replace the space character with a zero.\n\nTo convert a stream of bits back to a string, you can use the `Integer.parseInt(binary, 2)` method to convert each binary string to an integer, then use `new String(byte[], charset)` to get the string.\n\nHere is a sample code:\n\n```java\nString binary = \"0100100001100101011011000110110001101111\";\nbyte[] bytes = new byte[binary.length() / 8];\nfor (int i = 0; i < bytes.length; i++) {\n    bytes[i] = (byte) Integer.parseInt(binary.substring(i * 8, i * 8 + 8), 2);\n}\nString str = new String(bytes, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);\nSystem.out.println(str);\n```\n\nIn this code, `binary.substring(i * 8, i * 8 + 8)` is used to get each 8-digit binary string. Then `Integer.parseInt(binary, 2)` is used to convert it to an integer. The `new String(byte[], charset)` is used to get the string.\n\nPlease note that the `StandardCharsets.UTF_8` is used as the charset to convert the byte array to a string. You can use other charsets according to your needs.\n\nAlso, please note that the above code assumes that the string is encoded in UTF-8, which is the most commonly used encoding for text data. If the string is encoded in a different encoding, you should use the appropriate encoding when converting the byte array to a string.\n\nThis is a simple example and may not work for all cases. For example, it does not handle byte order marks (BOM), it does not handle multi-byte characters, and it does not handle errors. You may need to adjust the code to handle these cases according to your needs.\n\nI hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
