If your strings are larger than this, you will need to implement a custom solution to handle splitting and reassembling the strings.\n\nAlso, make sure to handle exceptions properly in your code. The readUTF method can throw IOException, so you should handle this in your code.\n```\n\nA: You can use DataOutputStream's writeUTF method to write a string to the output stream.
