So I want to convert the other two things as well in ByteArray so that I can merge all three together into a single ByteArray.\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer: Yes, it is possible to merge three ByteArrays together and then split the resulting ByteArray. Here is how you can do it:\n\n<<<api>>>: DataOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nbyte[] avroBinaryValue = os.toByteArray();\nString schemaName = \"DEMOGRAPHIC\";\nlong lastModifiedDate = 1379811105109;\n\nbyte[] byteSchemaName = schemaName.getBytes();\nbyte[] byteLMD = ByteBuffer.allocate(Long.BYTES).putLong(lastModifiedDate).array();\n\nByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();\nDataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(baos);\n\ndos.write(avroBinaryValue);\ndos.write(byteSchemaName);\ndos.write(byteLMD);\n\nbyte[] mergedByteArray = baos.toByteArray();\n```\n\n<<<explanation>>>: \nThe `DataOutputStream.write` method is used to write the byte array to the output stream. The `ByteArrayOutputStream` is used to create a byte array output stream that writes data to an in-memory byte array. After writing the three byte arrays (avroBinaryValue, byteSchemaName, and byteLMD) to the `DataOutputStream`, we get the merged byte array by calling `toByteArray()` on the `ByteArrayOutputStream`.\n\nTo split the merged byte array, you can use the `DataInputStream.read` method. Here is how you can do it:\n\n```java\nByteArrayInputStream bais = new ByteArrayInputStream(mergedByteArray);\nDataInputStream dis = new DataInputStream(bais);\n\nbyte[] restoredAvroBinaryValue = new byte[avroBinaryValue.length];\ndis.readFully(restoredAvroBinaryValue);\n\nbyte[] restoredByteSchemaName = new byte[byteSchemaName.length];\ndis.readFully(restoredByteSchemaName);\n\nbyte[] restoredByteLMD = new byte[Long.BYTES];\ndis.readFully(restoredByteLMD);\n```\n\nThis will give you the three original byte arrays (avroBinaryValue, byteSchemaName, and byteLMD) back.\n\nNote: The `readFully` method will throw an `EOFException` if the end of the stream is reached before reading the required number of bytes. To avoid this, you can use the `read` method instead, which will return -1 when the end of the stream is reached. You can then check if the number of bytes read is equal to the required number of bytes.\n\nThis approach will not take much space on the disk as it is merging the three byte arrays into one. The split operation will also be efficient as it is just reading the byte arrays from the merged byte array.\n\nPlease note that the `DataOutputStream.write` method writes the byte array as is, without any additional information about the length of the byte array. Therefore, when reading the byte arrays back, you need to know the length of each byte array before reading it.\n\nAlso, remember to close the `DataOutputStream` and `ByteArrayOutputStream` when you are done with them to free up system resources.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>"}
