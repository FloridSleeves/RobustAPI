Then we call the `inputStreamToByteArray` method to convert the InputStream to a byte array. This method uses a ByteArrayOutputStream to write the inputStream to a byte array. The inputStream is read in chunks of 1024 bytes, and each chunk is written to the outputStream. The outputStream is then converted to a byte array using the `toByteArray` method.\n\nThis code will print the bytes 1 to 5 to the console.\n\nNote: The `inputStreamToByteArray` method closes the inputStream and the outputStream when it's done. If you don't want to close the streams, you can remove the `inputStream.close()` and `outputStream.close()` lines.\n\nNote: This code assumes that the inputStream is not null and that it can be read to completion. If the inputStream is null or cannot be read to completion, additional error checking may be needed.\n\nNote: This code uses Java 8 syntax. If you're using an older version of Java, you may need to adjust the code to use older syntax.\n\nNote: This code uses the `ByteArrayOutputStream` class, which is part of the Java standard library. If you're using a different library or framework, you may need to use a different method to convert the InputStream to a byte array.\n\nNote: This code uses the `ByteArrayInputStream` class, which is part of the Java standard library.
