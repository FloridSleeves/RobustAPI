The StringWriter is then converted to a String. The InputStream is closed in the finally block to ensure it is always closed. If the InputStream is null, an empty String is returned.\n\n```java\npublic String convertStreamToString(InputStream is) throws IOException {\n    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n    try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(is))) {\n        String line;\n        while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n            sb.append(line);\n        }\n    }\n    return sb.toString();\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: This function reads the input stream line by line and appends it to a StringBuilder. The StringBuilder is then converted to a String. The try-with-resources statement is used to automatically close the BufferedReader.\n\n```java\npublic String convertStreamToString(InputStream is) throws IOException {\n    ByteArrayOutputStream result = new ByteArrayOutputStream();\n    byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\n    int length;\n    while ((length = is.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n        result.write(buffer, 0, length);\n    }\n    return result.toString(\"UTF-8\");\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: This function reads the input stream byte by byte and writes it to a ByteArrayOutputStream. The ByteArrayOutputStream is then converted to a String using the specified character set. The InputStream is closed in the finally block to ensure it is always closed.\n\n```java\npublic String convertStreamToString(InputStream is) throws IOException {\n    return new java.util.Scanner(is, \"UTF-8\").useDelimiter(\"\\\\A\").next();\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: This function uses a java.util.Scanner to read the entire InputStream as a String. The Scanner is configured to use the UTF-8 character set and to use the delimiter \"\\\\A\" to read the entire InputStream. The next() method is then used to read the entire InputStream as a String.\n\n```java\npublic String convertStreamToString(InputStream is) throws IOException {\n    return new java.io.BufferedReader(new java.io.InputStreamReader(is, \"UTF-8\")).readLine();\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: This function uses a java.io.BufferedReader to read the entire InputStream as a String. The BufferedReader is configured to use the UTF-8 character set. The readLine() method is then used to read the entire InputStream as a String.\n\n```java\npublic String convertStreamToString(InputStream is) throws IOException {\n    ByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();\n    byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\n    int length;\n    while ((length = is.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n        baos.write(buffer, 0, length);\n    }\n    return baos.toString(\"UTF-8\");\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: This function reads the input stream byte by byte and writes it to a ByteArrayOutputStream.
