The parameters are catalog, schemaPattern, tableName, and columnName. Here, we are using null for catalog and schemaPattern as we are fetching metadata for all tables and columns.\n\nA: You can use the getColumns() method of the DatabaseMetaData class to get the column descriptions. Here is how you can modify your code:\n```java\npublic ArrayList<String> fetchTable(String value) {\n    try {\n        makeConnection();\n        DatabaseMetaData dbmd = conn.getMetaData();\n        ResultSet rs = dbmd.getColumns(null, null, value, null);\n        while (rs.next()) {\n            String columnName = rs.getString(\"COLUMN_NAME\");\n            String columnDesc = rs.getString(\"REMARKS\");\n            System.out.println(columnName + \": \" + columnDesc);\n            columns.add(columnName);\n        }\n        rs.close();\n    } catch (Exception ae) {\n        ae.printStackTrace();\n    }\n    return columns;\n}\n```\nIn this code, getColumns() method is used to get the ResultSet which contains the metadata of all columns in the specified table. The \"COLUMN_NAME\" and \"REMARKS\" are column names in the ResultSet which represent the column name and column description respectively. The while loop is used to iterate over the ResultSet and print the column name and description.\n\nPlease note that the \"REMARKS\" column may not always be available in the ResultSet, so you may need to handle the case where columnDesc is null.\n\nAlso, remember to close the ResultSet after you're done with it to free up resources.\n\nThis code uses JDBC to connect to the database and retrieve the metadata. Make sure you have the necessary JDBC driver for MS Access in your classpath.\n\nI hope this helps. Let me know if you have any further questions.\n\nNote: The above code is for MS Access.
