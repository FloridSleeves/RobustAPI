In this case, it writes the first element of the array 'value' to the output stream.\n\n\nA: The split() method in Java uses regular expressions. The special character \\r and \\n are escape sequences for carriage return and newline respectively. So, \"\\r\\n09/19/14\" is a string that matches a newline character followed by the string \"09/19/14\".\nIf you want to split the string at each newline character, you should use \"\\n\" instead of \"\\r\\n\".\nString[] value = line.split(\"\\n\");\n\nThis will split the string at each newline character and return an array of substrings.\n\nA: The split() method in Java uses regular expressions.
