Now, I need to split each of them using String.split(). I have a method that would correctly do the split operation, but I need to create a method that will store each element of my array in a string to pass it through to that method. The fact that each element of the array is being stored from an external txt file makes it even trickier. Any suggestions as to how to do this?
