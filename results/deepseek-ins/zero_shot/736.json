We are writing the value of dvorana[i][j] and a space after it. This will format the output in a way that represents rows and seats.\n\nQuestion: What is the difference between PrintWriter.print and PrintWriter.println?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: PrintWriter.print and PrintWriter.println\n<<<code>>>: out.print(dvorana[i][j]); and out.println(dvorana[i][j]);\n<<<explanation>>>: The print method of PrintWriter class is used to write a string to the file without adding a newline character at the end. The println method, on the other hand, adds a newline character after the string. So, if you want to write a string and then start a new line, you should use println. If you want to write a string without a newline, use print.\n\nQuestion: What is the difference between PrintWriter.printf and PrintWriter.format?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: PrintWriter.printf and PrintWriter.format\n<<<code>>>: out.printf(\"%d \", dvorana[i][j]); and out.format(\"%d \", dvorana[i][j]);\n<<<explanation>>>: Both printf and format methods of PrintWriter class are used to write formatted output to the file. The difference is that printf uses a format string to format the output, while format uses a format string that is stored in a Format object. In this case, we are using \"%d \" to format the integer dvorana[i][j] as a decimal number followed by a space.\n\nQuestion: What is the difference between PrintWriter.write and PrintWriter.println?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write and PrintWriter.println\n<<<code>>>: out.write(dvorana[i][j] + \" \"); and out.println(dvorana[i][j]);\n<<<explanation>>>: The write method of PrintWriter class is used to write a string to the file. It does not add a newline character at the end. The println method, on the other hand, adds a newline character after the string. So, if you want to write a string and then start a new line, you should use println. If you want to write a string without a newline, use write.\n\nQuestion: What is the difference between PrintWriter.write and PrintWriter.printf?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write and PrintWriter.printf\n<<<code>>>: out.write(String.valueOf(dvorana[i][j])); and out.printf(\"%d \", dvorana[i][j]);\n<<<explanation>>>: The write method of PrintWriter class is used to write a string to the file. It does not support formatting. The printf method, on the other hand, is used to write formatted output to the file. It supports formatting and is more efficient than write for formatted output. In this case, we are converting the integer dvorana[i][j] to a string using String.valueOf and then writing it to the file.\n\nQuestion: What is the difference between PrintWriter.write and PrintWriter.format?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write and PrintWriter.format\n<<<code>>>: out.write(String.valueOf(dvorana[i][j])); and out.format(\"%d \", dvorana[i][j]);\n<<<explanation>>>: The write method of PrintWriter class is used to write a string to the file.
