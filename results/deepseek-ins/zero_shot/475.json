What's the most straighforward and fast way to do so?One solution is to first toArray(), and then return the last element of the array. Is there any other better ones?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: \nIterator<String> iterator = collection.iterator();\nString lastElement = null;\nwhile(iterator.hasNext()) {\n    lastElement = iterator.next();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: This solution uses an iterator to iterate over the collection. The last element is stored in the variable lastElement. The while loop continues until there are no more elements in the collection. The last element is the one that is returned by the iterator.next() method, because it's the last one that was called.\n\n\nQuestion: How to get the last element of a LinkedList in Java?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: LinkedList.get(size()-1)\n<<<code>>>: \nLinkedList<String> linkedList = new LinkedList<>();\nString lastElement = linkedList.get(linkedList.size()-1);\n<<<explanation>>>: This solution uses the LinkedList.get(int index) method to get the last element of the LinkedList. The index of the last element is always the size of the LinkedList minus 1.\n\n\nQuestion: How to get the last element of a Stack in Java?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Stack.peek()\n<<<code>>>: \nStack<String> stack = new Stack<>();\nString lastElement = stack.peek();\n<<<explanation>>>: This solution uses the Stack.peek() method to get the last element of the Stack. The peek method returns the element at the top of the stack without removing it.\n\n\nQuestion: How to get the last element of a Queue in Java?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Queue.peek() or Queue.peek()\n<<<code>>>: \nQueue<String> queue = new LinkedList<>();\nString lastElement = queue.peek();\n<<<explanation>>>: This solution uses the Queue.peek() method to get the last element of the Queue. The peek method returns the element at the front of the queue without removing it. However, it's important to note that Queue interface does not have a direct method to get the last element. The last element of a Queue can be obtained by continuously dequeuing elements until there are no more elements in the Queue, but this is not efficient.\n\n\nQuestion: How to get the last element of a PriorityQueue in Java?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Not directly available\n<<<code>>>: \nPriorityQueue<String> priorityQueue = new PriorityQueue<>();\nString lastElement = null;\nwhile(!priorityQueue.isEmpty()) {\n    lastElement = priorityQueue.poll();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: This solution uses the PriorityQueue.poll() method to get and remove the last element of the PriorityQueue. The last element is the one that is returned by the poll method, because it's the last one that was removed. However, it's important to note that this solution is not efficient because it removes all elements from the PriorityQueue.\n\n\nQuestion: How to get the last element of a Deque in Java?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Deque.getLast()\n<<<code>>>: \nDeque<String> deque = new ArrayDeque<>();\nString lastElement = deque.getLast();\n<<<explanation>>>: This solution uses the Deque.getLast() method to get the last element of the Deque. The getLast method returns the element at the end of the deque.\n\n\nQuestion: How to get the last element of a Vector in Java?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Vector.get(size()-1)\n<<<code>>>: \nVector<String> vector = new Vector<>();\nString lastElement = vector.get(vector.size()-1);\n<<<explanation>>>: This solution uses the Vector.get(int index) method to get the last element of the Vector. The index of the last element is always the size of the Vector minus 1.\n\n\nQuestion: How to get the last element of a HashSet in Java?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Not directly available\n<<<code>>>: \nHashSet<String> hashSet = new HashSet<>();\nString lastElement = null;\nIterator<String> iterator = hashSet.iterator();\nwhile(iterator"}
