It's used to load images from the internet and cache them in the device's memory. The 'resize' method is used to set the target width and height of the image, 'centerCrop' is used to ensure that the image is cropped to the target aspect ratio. The 'placeholder' and 'error' methods are used to display a loading indicator or error image while the image is being loaded.\n\nHere is an example of how you can use Picasso in your code:\n\n```java\nPicasso.get().load(q.getImageURL()).placeholder(R.drawable.loading_spinner).error(R.drawable.error_image).resize(targetWidth, targetHeight).centerCrop().into(questionImage);\n```\n\nThis code will load the image from the URL, display a loading spinner while the image is being loaded, display an error image if the image cannot be loaded, resize the image to the target width and height, center crop the image to ensure it fills the entire ImageView, and then load the image into the ImageView.\n\nPicasso also supports ProgressDialog, so you can dismiss it when the image is loaded. Here is an example:\n\n```java\nfinal ProgressDialog progressDialog = new ProgressDialog(context);\nprogressDialog.setMessage(\"Loading image...\");\nprogressDialog.show();\n\nPicasso.get().load(q.getImageURL()).placeholder(R.drawable.loading_spinner).error(R.drawable.error_image).resize(targetWidth, targetHeight).centerCrop().into(new com.squareup.picasso.Target() {\n    @Override\n    public void onBitmapLoaded(Bitmap bitmap, Picasso.LoadedFrom from) {\n        questionImage.setImageBitmap(bitmap);\n        progressDialog.dismiss();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onBitmapFailed(Exception e, Drawable errorDrawable) {\n        Toast.makeText(context, \"Failed loading the image...\\nID: \" + q.getID(), Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();\n        progressDialog.dismiss();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onPrepareLoad(Drawable placeHolderDrawable) {\n        // Optional: This method is called when the image is about to load.\n    }\n});\n```\n\nIn this code, a ProgressDialog is shown while the image is being loaded. The ProgressDialog is dismissed when the image is loaded or if the image loading fails.\n\nPicasso is a great library for loading and caching images in Android, and it handles a large number of images efficiently.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>"}
