If the map is empty, it returns null.\n\n\nA: The TreeMap class implements the SortedMap interface, so you can use the firstKey() method. However, the error you're seeing suggests that the compiler can't find the method firstKey() in the SortedMap interface.\n\nThe error message \"cannot find symbol\" usually means that the compiler can't find the method you're trying to call.\n\nHere's how you can use the firstKey() method:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.TreeMap;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        TreeMap<Integer, Character> memory = new TreeMap<>();\n        memory.put(1, 'a');\n        memory.put(2, 'b');\n        memory.put(3, 'c');\n\n        Integer firstKey = memory.firstKey();\n        System.out.println(firstKey);  // Output: 1\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, we create a TreeMap named memory. We then add some elements to the map using the put() method. Finally, we use the firstKey() method to get the first key from the map and print it out.\n\nIf you still get the error, make sure you have imported the correct TreeMap class (java.util.TreeMap) and that you're calling the method on an instance of TreeMap (not on an interface or a superclass).\n\nIf you're still having trouble, please provide more context or the full code so I can give a more accurate answer.\n\n\nA: The error message \"cannot find symbol\" usually means that the compiler can't find the method you're trying to call.\n\nThe error message \"cannot find symbol\" usually means that the compiler can't find the method you're trying to call.\n\nHere's how you can use the firstKey() method:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.TreeMap;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        TreeMap<Integer, Character> memory = new TreeMap<>();\n        memory.put(1, 'a');\n        memory.put(2, 'b');\n        memory.put(3, 'c');\n\n        Integer firstKey = memory.firstKey();\n        System.out.println(firstKey);  // Output: 1\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, we create a TreeMap named memory.
