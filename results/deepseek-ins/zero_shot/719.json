The value of the attribute is the variable \"boardSize\". This way, you can access the boardSize in your JavaScript code.\n\nA: You can pass the boardSize to your JavaScript by setting an attribute on an HTML element. Here's how you can do it:\n\n\n*\n\n*In your HTML, add an element that will hold the boardSize:\n\n\n```html\n<div id=\"boardSizeHolder\" style=\"display: none;\"></div>\n```\n\n\n*In your servlet, write the boardSize to this element:\n\n\n```java\nint boardSize = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter(\"boardSize\"));\nPrintWriter out = response.getWriter();\nout.write(\"<script>document.getElementById('boardSizeHolder').innerText = '\" + boardSize + \"';</script>\");\n```\n\n\n*Now, in your JavaScript, you can access the boardSize:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar boardSize = document.getElementById('boardSizeHolder').innerText;\n```\n\n\n*Now you can use the boardSize in your JavaScript code.\n\n\nPlease note that this is a very simple way to pass data from a servlet to JavaScript. For a more complex application, you might want to consider using AJAX to send the boardSize to the JavaScript, or using a JavaScript framework like Angular or React that provides more robust ways to handle data binding.\n\nA: You can use JavaScript's localStorage or sessionStorage to store and retrieve data.\n\nHere is how you can do it:\n\nIn your servlet, write the boardSize to localStorage:\n\n```java\nint boardSize = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter(\"boardSize\"));\nPrintWriter out = response.getWriter();\nout.write(\"<script>localStorage.setItem('boardSize', '\" + boardSize + \"');</script>\");\n```\n\nNow, in your JavaScript, you can access the boardSize:\n\n```javascript\nvar boardSize = localStorage.getItem('boardSize');\n```\n\nNow you can use the boardSize in your JavaScript code.\n\nPlease note that localStorage and sessionStorage are part of the Web Storage API, and they are not available in all browsers. Also, localStorage data is persisted until explicitly deleted, while sessionStorage data is lost when the page session ends.\n\nA: You can use JavaScript's document.cookie to store and retrieve data.\n\nHere is how you can do it:\n\nIn your servlet, write the boardSize to a cookie:\n\n```java\nint boardSize = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter(\"boardSize\"));\nPrintWriter out = response.getWriter();\nout.write(\"<script>document.cookie = 'boardSize=\" + boardSize + \"';</script>\");\n```\n\nNow, in your JavaScript, you can access the boardSize:\n\n```javascript\nvar cookies = document.cookie.split(\";\");\nfor(var i = 0; i < cookies.length; i++) {\n    var cookie = cookies[i].trim();\n    if (cookie.startsWith(\"boardSize=\")) {\n        var boardSize = cookie.substring(\"boardSize=\".length, cookie.length);\n        break;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow you can use the boardSize in your JavaScript code.\n\nPlease note that cookies are part of the HTTP protocol and are sent with every HTTP request, so they can be a bit slow. Also, cookies have a maximum size of 4KB, and they can be configured to expire after a certain amount of time.\n\nA: You can use JavaScript's URLSearchParams to get the URL parameters.\n\nHere is how you can do it:\n\nIn your servlet, write the boardSize to the URL:\n\n```java\nint boardSize = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter(\"boardSize\"));\nString url = \"/BoardGame.html?boardSize=\" + boardSize;\nresponse.sendRedirect(url);\n```\n\nNow, in your JavaScript, you can access the boardSize:\n\n```javascript\nvar urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search"}
