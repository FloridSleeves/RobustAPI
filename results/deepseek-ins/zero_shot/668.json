The \"\\r\\n\" is used to represent a newline in Windows.\n\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java: :This code:BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"file.txt\"));String line;while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {System.out.println(line);}Outputs:content of file.txt.Instead of:content of file.txt.I tried using BufferedReader but it doesn't work.

It makes the performance fast by buffering characters. The readLine() method reads a line of text. It returns null if the end of the stream is reached.\n\nQuestion: How to write a file in Java: :This code:PrintWriter output = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(\"output.txt\", false));output.println(\"something\\n\");output.println(\"something else\\n\");Outputs:something something elseInstead of:something something else.I tried using PrintWriter but it doesn't work.

I'm using windows 7\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: PrintWriter\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter output = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(\"output.txt\", false));output.println(\"something\");output.println(\"something else\");output.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The PrintWriter class in Java is used to write formatted representations of objects to a text-output stream. The println method writes a line separator followed by the string representation of the argument and then terminates the line. The close method is used to close the stream.\n\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java: :This code:BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"file.txt\"));String line;while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {System.out.println(line);}Outputs:content of file.txt.Instead of:content of file.txt.I tried using BufferedReader but it doesn't work.
