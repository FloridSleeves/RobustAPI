Can anyone help me with this?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: StringTokenizer\n<<<code>>>: \nStringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(mystring, \"<|>\", true);\nArrayList<String> tokens = new ArrayList<String>();\nwhile (st.hasMoreTokens()) {\n    String token = st.nextToken();\n    if (!token.equals(\"<\") && !token.equals(\">\")) {\n        tokens.add(token);\n    }\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: \nIn this code, we are using StringTokenizer to split the string into tokens. The delimiters are \"<\" and \">\". The third parameter is set to true, so the delimiters themselves are included in the tokens. Then we iterate over the tokens and add them to an ArrayList if they are not \"<\" or \">\".\n\n\nA: Here is the code to get the substring between \"<\" and \">\" using StringTokenizer:\n\n```java\nString mystring = \"one<1234567>,two<98765432>,three<878897656>\";\nStringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(mystring, \"<|>\", true);\nArrayList<String> tokens = new ArrayList<String>();\nwhile (st.hasMoreTokens()) {\n    String token = st.nextToken();\n    if (!token.equals(\"<\") && !token.equals(\">\")) {\n        tokens.add(token);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, we are using StringTokenizer to split the string into tokens. The delimiters are \"<\" and \">\". The third parameter is set to true, so the delimiters themselves are included in the tokens. Then we iterate over the tokens and add them to an ArrayList if they are not \"<\" or \">\".\n\nThe ArrayList 'tokens' will contain the substrings between \"<\" and \">\".\n\nPlease note that this code will also include the \"<\" and \">\" characters in the substrings. If you want to exclude them, you can modify the if condition to `if (token.charAt(0) != '<' && token.charAt(token.length()-1) != '>')`.\n\nThis code assumes that the \"<\" and \">\" characters are always present in the correct order and the string is properly formatted. If there are any edge cases that might not be handled correctly, you might need to add additional checks.\n\nAlso, please note that this code uses the deprecated `StringTokenizer` class. If you are using Java 8 or later, you might want to consider using the `Stream` API or a regular expression to achieve the same result.\n\n```java\nString mystring = \"one<1234567>,two<98765432>,three<878897656>\";\nPattern pattern = Pattern.compile(\"<.*?>\");\nMatcher matcher = pattern.matcher(mystring);\nList<String> tokens = new ArrayList<>();\nwhile (matcher.find()) {\n    tokens.add(matcher.group().substring(1, matcher.group().length() - 1));\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, we are using a regular expression to match the substrings between \"<\" and \">\". The `Pattern.compile(\"<.*?>\")` creates a pattern that matches any string that starts with \"<\" and ends with \">\". The `Matcher` class is used to match this pattern in the string. We add the matched substring to the list, excluding the \"<\" and \">\" characters.\n\nThis code will also work for any correctly formatted string, and it is more readable and easier to understand than the previous code.\n\nPlease note that regular expressions can be slower than the `StringTokenizer` class, especially for large strings. If performance is a concern, you might want to consider using a different approach.\n\nI hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
