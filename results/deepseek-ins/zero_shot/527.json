The most important, a list object can return a iterator object with the method getIterator(). This part of the code cannot be modified.class List<T> {class ListNode {    T val;    ListNode next;    ListNode (T v) {        val = v; next = null;    }}ListNode head;List (ListNode hd) { head = hd; }List () { this(null); }void prepend (T val) {    ListNode p = new ListNode(val);    p.next = head;    head = p;}//some other methodsclass ListIterator implements Iterator<T> {    ListNode pos;    ListIterator () {        pos = head;    }    public T next () {               T res = pos.val;        pos = pos.next;        return res;    }    public boolean hasNext () {        return pos != null;    }}Iterator<T> getIterator () {            return this.new ListIterator();}}Lets assume both list have the same type and for now they have also the same length. I tried to create a class with two iterator objects and used the methods of the iterator objects to implement the interface Iterator. This part of the code is created by me and can be modified.class ZipIterator<T> implements Iterator<T>{int counter;Iterator<T> first;Iterator<T> second;ZipIterator (Iterator<T> f, Iterator<T> s){    first = f;    second = s;    counter = 0;}public T next (){    if (counter % 2 == 0)    {        counter++;        return first.next();    }    else    {        counter++;        return second.next();    }}public boolean hasNext (){    if (counter % 2 == 0)        return first.hasNext();    else        return second.hasNext();}}This works fine for two list with the same type. Here is the code and the output I used for the test:class IteratorUtils{public static void main (String[] args){    List<Integer> lst1 = new List<>();    List<Integer> lst2 = new List<>();    lst1.prepend(3);    lst1.prepend(2);    lst1.prepend(1);    lst2.prepend(8);    lst2.prepend(9);    lst2.prepend(10);    Iterator<Integer> it1 = lst1.getIterator();    Iterator<Integer> it2 = lst2.getIterator();    ZipIterator<Integer> zit = new ZipIterator<>(it1, it2);    while (zit.hasNext())    {        System.out.println(zit.next());    }}}Output:1102938Now I want to implement the ZipIterator in a generic way, so I can use two lists with different types of items (e.g. integer and string). I know I have to change the class ZipIterator so the method next() returns a generic type but I don't know how.This is a university task i have to do and the prof has left a hint \"use wild cards like: ? extends T, ? super T, ? extends Object\". But with the wild cards i can only specify the types in or against the inherits direction, right? Is this possible to change the ZipIterator class that way so it accepts two iterator objects with different types?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to iterate through two generic lists with different types one item after another in java?: :I want to create an iterator class which allows me to iterate through lists with generic types (e.g. lst1 integer, lst2 string) one item after another.For this I have to consider the following given situation.The interface is a generic Iterator.
