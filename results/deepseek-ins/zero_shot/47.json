It requires a PackageManager object as a parameter. The PackageManager object is obtained from the getPackageManager() method of the Context object.\n\nI'm getting a RuntimeException saying Can't create handler inside thread that has not called Looper.prepare()It points at the line where ProgressDialog.show() was called.\nPlease using this api: ProgressDialog.show\n<<<api>>>: ProgressDialog dialog = ProgressDialog.show(Apps.this, \"Retreiving Application list\", \"Retrieving list of installed applications\", true);\n<<<code>>>: dialog = ProgressDialog.show(Apps.this, \"Retreiving Application list\", \"Retrieving list of installed applications\", true);\n<<<explanation>>>: The show() method is used to display a ProgressDialog. It requires a Context object, a title for the dialog, a message for the dialog, and a boolean to indicate whether the dialog should be cancelable or not.\n\nThe RuntimeException is because the ProgressDialog.show() method is being called from a non-UI thread (the doInBackground() method), and it needs to be called from the UI thread. To fix this, you can use the runOnUiThread() method to ensure that the ProgressDialog is displayed on the UI thread. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```java\nclass RetrieveApps extends AsyncTask<String, Void, List<ApplicationInfo>> {\n    PackageManager pm;\n    ProgressDialog dialog;\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onPreExecute() {\n        dialog = ProgressDialog.show(Apps.this, \"Retreiving Application list\", \"Retrieving list of installed applications\", true);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected List<ApplicationInfo> doInBackground(String...params) {\n        pm = getPackageManager();\n        return pm.getInstalledApplications(PackageManager.GET_META_DATA);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onPostExecute(List<ApplicationInfo> result) {\n        dialog.dismiss();\n        for(ApplicationInfo nfo : result){\n            Drawable icon = nfo.loadIcon(pm);\n            String name = nfo.loadLabel(pm).toString();\n            if(name != null && icon != null){\n                apps.add(new App(name, icon));\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this modified code, the ProgressDialog is displayed in the onPreExecute() method, which is called before the doInBackground() method is executed. The ProgressDialog is dismissed in the onPostExecute() method, after the doInBackground() method has finished executing. This ensures that the ProgressDialog is displayed and dismissed on the UI thread.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>"}
