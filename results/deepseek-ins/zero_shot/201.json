The server is connected to a database.Ok, sorry for that, it's a classic question I'm sure, but I don't know how to start.In a project I worked for they implemented a lot of magic with Proxy.newProxyInstance() to invoke the Glassfish server transparently.I don't want to use a Glassfish server. I just want something simple in plain Java. But the concept of proxies seems pretty cool.Do you have ideas or examples of such thing? How do I write the server part to handle the requests of clients?Thanks in advanceFluminis\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: make a client server java application: :I am trying to make a Java application in a client/server way.The client is a GUI in SWT which displays data from the server.

The read method returns an int value which is the byte read, or -1 if the end of the stream has been reached.\n\n```java\nwhile ((data = inputStream.read()) != -1) {\n    System.out.println(data);\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: This code reads bytes from the URL \"http://example.com\" and prints them to the console. The loop continues until the end of the stream is reached.\n\n```java\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\nint bytesRead;\nwhile ((bytesRead = inputStream.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n    System.out.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: This code reads bytes from the URL \"http://example.com\" into a buffer and prints them to the console. The loop continues until the end of the stream is reached. The number of bytes read is returned by the read method and used to write to the console.\n\n```java\ntry (InputStream inputStream = new URL(\"http://example.com\").openStream()) {\n    // read from inputStream\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: This code reads bytes from the URL \"http://example.com\" into an InputStream. The InputStream is automatically closed at the end of the try-with-resources statement. If an IOException occurs, it is caught and its stack trace is printed to the console.\n\n```java\nServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(8080);\nSocket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();\nInputStream inputStream = clientSocket.getInputStream();\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: This code creates a ServerSocket on port 8080 and waits for a client to connect. Once a client connects, it gets an InputStream from the client's socket. The InputStream can be used to read data from the client.\n\n```java\nServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(8080);\nSocket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();\nInputStream inputStream = clientSocket.getInputStream();\nBufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(inputStream));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: This code reads lines from the client's InputStream using a BufferedReader. The BufferedReader reads text from a character-input stream, buffering characters so as to provide for the efficient reading of characters, arrays, and lines. Each line is read by the readLine method. The loop continues until the end of the stream is reached.\n\n```java\nServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(8080);\nSocket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();\nInputStream inputStream = clientSocket.getInputStream();\nDataInputStream dis = new DataInputStream(inputStream);\nint data = dis.readInt();\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: This code reads an int from the client's InputStream using a DataInputStream. The readInt method reads the next four bytes from the InputStream and returns an int value.\n\n```java\nServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(8080);\nSocket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();\nInputStream inputStream = clientSocket.getInputStream();\nDataInputStream dis = new DataInputStream(inputStream);\nString data = dis.readUTF();\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: This code reads a String from the client's InputStream using a DataInputStream. The readUTF method reads a String from the InputStream. The String is prefixed with its length as a two-byte value.\n\n```java\nServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(8080);\nSocket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();\nOutputStream outputStream = clientSocket.getOutputStream();\noutputStream.write(1);\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: This code writes a byte to the client's OutputStream. The write method writes the specified byte to the OutputStream.\n\n```java\nServerSocket serverSocket = new Server"}
