I'm attempting to do this in a loop.  The ArrayList seems to fill, but when I print it out after, all the elements in each index are the same as the last element added to the ArrayList.  This seems to have something to do with each arrayList index pointing to the object (my newbie guess).  Do I have to create a unique object for each arrayList entry? Is there an easy way to add to this code to do this?public class Point2DDemo extends Point2D<Double>{    ArrayList<Point2DDemo> Points = new ArrayList<Point2DDemo>(7);    /**     * Constructor for objects of class Point2DDemo     */    public Point2DDemo()    {    }    public Point2DDemo(double first, double second)    {        setFirst(first);        setSecond(second);    }    public void putPair(double point1, double point2){        this.setFirst(point1);        this.setSecond(point2);    }    /**     *      *      * @param  y   a sample parameter for a method     * @return     the sum of x and y      */    public void createList()    {        FileIO readFile = new FileIO();        readFile.openInputFile();        String pointLine = null;        Point2DDemo newPoints = new Point2DDemo();        StringTokenizer stringSplit = null;        while(readFile.hasInputLine())        {           pointLine = readFile.readInputLine();           stringSplit = new StringTokenizer(pointLine);           double pointX = Double.parseDouble(stringSplit.nextToken());           double pointY = Double.parseDouble(stringSplit.nextToken());           newPoints.putPair(pointX, pointY);           Points.add(newPoints);        }        for(int i = 0; i < Points.size(); i++)         System.out.println(Points.get(i));         readFile.closeInputFile();    }\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: filling array list with objects, causing all elements to be the same in list: :This question already has answers here:                                                            Why does my ArrayList contain N copies of the last item added to the list?

Each time you call Points.add(newPoints), you are adding the same object reference to the ArrayList. Therefore, when you change the object, all references to the object in the ArrayList will see the change.\n\nTo fix this, you need to create a new object for each entry in the ArrayList. You can do this by changing the line where you add the object to Points.add(newPoints); to Points.add(new Point2DDemo(pointX, pointY));. This will create a new Point2DDemo object with the correct values and add it to the ArrayList.\n\nHere is the corrected code:\n\n```java\npublic void createList() {\n    FileIO readFile = new FileIO();\n    readFile.openInputFile();\n    String pointLine = null;\n    StringTokenizer stringSplit = null;\n    while(readFile.hasInputLine()) {\n        pointLine = readFile.readInputLine();\n        stringSplit = new StringTokenizer(pointLine);\n        double pointX = Double.parseDouble(stringSplit.nextToken());\n        double pointY = Double.parseDouble(stringSplit.nextToken());\n        Points.add(new Point2DDemo(pointX, pointY)); // Create a new object for each entry\n    }\n    for(int i = 0; i < Points.size(); i++)\n        System.out.println(Points.get(i));\n    readFile.closeInputFile();\n}\n```\n\nThis should solve your problem.\n\nNote: In Java, it's generally better to use a for-each loop to iterate over the elements of a collection, instead of using a traditional for loop with an index. This can make your code more readable and less error-prone. Here's how you could rewrite the print loop using a for-each loop:\n\n```java\nfor(Point2DDemo point : Points)\n    System.out.println(point);\n```\n\nThis will give you the same output as your original loop, but it's more concise and easier to read.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
