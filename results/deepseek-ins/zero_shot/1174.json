When it encounters a quoted string, it will only return the quoted string and will not move the tokenizer's cursor to the next token. This means that the tokenizer is left at the end of the string, and when it tries to parse the next token, it fails because there is no more content.\n\nTo fix this issue, you can use the Apache Commons Lang library's StringUtils.substringBetween method to extract the URI from the link string. This method will correctly handle quoted strings.\n\nHere is an example of how you can use it:\n\n```java\nimport org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils;\n\nString linkString = \"<http://localhost:8085/myapp/testversions/files/big.jpg;version=1>; rel=\\\"source\\\"\";\nString uri = StringUtils.substringBetween(linkString, \"<\", \">\");\nLink lnk = Link.valueOf(uri);\n```\n\nIn this example, the StringUtils.substringBetween method is used to extract the URI from the link string. It returns the substring between the \"<\" and \">\" characters. This will correctly handle the URI even if it contains matrix parameters.\n\nThis should resolve the parsing error you were encountering.\n\nNote: Make sure to include the Apache Commons Lang library in your project to use the StringUtils class.\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>org.apache.commons</groupId>\n    <artifactId>commons-lang3</artifactId>\n    <version>3.12.0</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n\nThis should be added in your pom.xml file.\n\nI hope this helps you to resolve the issue.\n\nNote: This solution is based on the assumption that you are using the Apache Commons Lang library. If you are not using this library, you may need to find another method to extract the URI from the link string.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions.\n\nAnswer: The error is due to the fact that the StringTokenizer.nextToken method does not handle quoted strings correctly.
