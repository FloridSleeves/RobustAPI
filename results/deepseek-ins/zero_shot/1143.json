It then creates a new Point object with these coordinates and adds it to the list. Finally, it prints out all the points.\nClosed 9 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 9 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 9 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 9 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 9 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 9 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 9 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 9 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 9 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 9 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 9 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 9 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 9 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 9 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 9 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 9 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 9 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 9 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 9 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 9 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 9 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 9 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 9 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 9 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 9 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 9 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 9 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 9 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 9 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 9 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 9 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 9 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 9 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 9 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 9 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 9 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 9 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 9 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 9 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 9 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 9 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 9 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 9 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 9 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 9 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 9 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 9 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 9 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 9 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 9 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 9 years ago.\n"}
