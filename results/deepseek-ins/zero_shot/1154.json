The tokens are Name, age, Sex and field. We are using nextToken() method to get the next token from the string.\n\nPlease note that StringTokenizer is a legacy class that is recommended to be replaced by the split() method or Scanner class in Java.\n```\n\nQuestion: In read and write text file i have to print all the data in the text file but it print only the last line how to get all line write.\nProgram: \n```java\npublic class fs {\n    try {\n        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"C:/Users/madhan kumar/Desktop/read.txt\"));\n        String s;\n        while((s=in.readLine()) != null) {\n            StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(s, \"|\");\n            String Name = st.nextToken();\n            String age = st.nextToken();\n            String Sex = st.nextToken();\n            String field = st.nextToken();\n            System.out.println(\"Name :\"+Name+\" Age :\"+age+\" Sex :\"+Sex+\" Field :\"+field);\n            \n            BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(\"out.txt\"));\n            bw.write(\"Name :\"+Name+\" Age :\"+age+\" Sex :\"+Sex+\" Field :\"+field);\n            bw.close();\n        }\n    } catch(Exception e) {\n        System.out.println(e);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnswer: The code you provided will write each line to the output file separately. If you want to write all lines to the output file, you should open the BufferedWriter outside the while loop. Here is the corrected code:\n\n```java\npublic class fs {\n    try {\n        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"C:/Users/madhan kumar/Desktop/read.txt\"));\n        String s;\n        BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(\"out.txt\"));\n        while((s=in.readLine()) != null) {\n            StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(s, \"|\");\n            String Name = st.nextToken();\n            String age = st.nextToken();\n            String Sex = st.nextToken();\n            String field = st.nextToken();\n            System.out.println(\"Name :\"+Name+\" Age :\"+age+\" Sex :\"+Sex+\" Field :\"+field);\n            \n            bw.write(\"Name :\"+Name+\" Age :\"+age+\" Sex :\"+Sex+\" Field :\"+field);\n            bw.newLine(); // This will write a new line after each line\n        }\n        bw.close();\n    } catch(Exception e) {\n        System.out.println(e);\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code will write all the lines to the output file. Each line will be written on a new line in the output file.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>"}
