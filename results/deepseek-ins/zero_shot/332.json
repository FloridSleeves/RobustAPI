This can lead to unexpected behavior if you try to add these entries to another collection.\n\nIn your code, you are using `sortedEntries.addAll(map.entrySet())`. If the `entrySet()` method is returning a view of the underlying Map that reuses the same Entry object, this could lead to unexpected behavior.\n\nTo avoid this, you can use a for-each loop instead of `addAll`. The for-each loop creates a new Entry object for each entry in the map, so it should work correctly even if the `entrySet()` method is returning a view of the underlying Map that reuses Entry objects.\n\nHere is how you can modify your code:\n\n```java\nfor (Map.Entry<K,V> entry : map.entrySet()) {\n    sortedEntries.add(entry);\n}\n```\n\nThis code will create a new Entry object for each entry in the map, so it should work correctly even if the `entrySet()` method is returning a view of the underlying Map that reuses Entry objects.\n\nPlease note that this is just a workaround. If you have a specific reason to use `addAll`, you might need to find a different solution.\n\nAlso, please note that this warning is not relevant to this particular code. It's a general Java best practice advice.\n\nIn conclusion, the FindBugs warning is related to the fact that the `entrySet()` method of a Map can return a view of the underlying Map that reuses the same Entry object for each entry.
