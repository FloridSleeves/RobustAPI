It is a simple dictionary file encoded 1250 with 2.8 million lines in it. Every line has only one unique word:catdoggod...I want to use Lucene to search for every anagram in dictionary of specific word. For example:I want to search every anagram of the word dog and lucene should search my dictionary and return dog and god. In my webapp I have a Word Entity:public class Word {    private Long id;    private String word;    private String baseLetters;    private String definition;}and baseLetters is the variable which are sorted letters alphabetically for searching such anagrams [god and dog words will have the same baseLetters: dgo]. I succeeded in searching such anagrams from my database using this baseLetters variable in different service but I have problem to create index of my dictionary file. I know I have to add to fields:word and baseLetters but I have no idea how to do it :( Could someone show me some directions to achieve this goal?For now I have only something like that:public class DictionaryIndexer {private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(DictionaryIndexer.class);@Value(\"${dictionary.path}\")private String dictionaryPath;@Value(\"${lucene.search.indexDir}\")private String indexPath;public void createIndex() throws CorruptIndexException, LockObtainFailedException {    try {        IndexWriter indexWriter = getLuceneIndexer();        createDocument();               } catch (IOException e) {        logger.error(e.getMessage(), e);    }        }private IndexWriter getLuceneIndexer() throws CorruptIndexException, LockObtainFailedException, IOException {    StandardAnalyzer analyzer = new StandardAnalyzer(Version.LUCENE_36);    IndexWriterConfig indexWriterConfig = new IndexWriterConfig(Version.LUCENE_36, analyzer);    indexWriterConfig.setOpenMode(OpenMode.CREATE_OR_APPEND);    Directory directory = new SimpleFSDirectory(new File(indexPath));    return new IndexWriter(directory, indexWriterConfig);}private void createDocument() throws FileNotFoundException {    File sjp = new File(dictionaryPath);    Reader reader = new FileReader(sjp);    Document dictionary = new Document();    dictionary.add(new Field(\"word\", reader));}}PS: One more question.

If i register DocumentIndexer as a bean in Spring will the index be creating/appending every time I redeploy my webapp? and the same will be with the future DictionarySearcher?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:\n<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nBufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(dictionaryPath));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    // ...\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: We use BufferedReader.readLine() to read each line from the dictionary file.\n\nTo add fields to Lucene document, you can use Document.add(Field). Here is an example:\n\n```java\nDocument dictionary = new Document();\ndictionary.add(new Field(\"word\", line, TextField.TYPE_STORED));\ndictionary.add(new Field(\"baseLetters\", sortLetters(line), TextField.TYPE_STORED));\n```\n\nIn this example, `line` is the word read from the dictionary file, and `sortLetters(line)` is a method that sorts the letters of the word alphabetically.\n\nAs for your second question, if you register DocumentIndexer as a bean in Spring, the index will be created/appended every time you redeploy your webapp. This is because Spring manages the lifecycle of your beans, and when you redeploy your webapp, Spring will recreate the bean.\n\nFor the DictionarySearcher, the same applies. If you register it as a bean in Spring, it will be recreated every time you redeploy your webapp.\n\nRemember to close the BufferedReader after you finish reading the file:\n\n```java\nbr.close();\n```\n\nThis will free up system resources.\n\nPlease note that this is a general answer. Depending on your specific requirements, you may need to adjust the code accordingly.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
