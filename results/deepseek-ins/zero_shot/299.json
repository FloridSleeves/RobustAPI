In this case, you are getting each sublist in the list of lists.\n\n\nA: Here is a solution using Java 8 Streams. This solution assumes that all sublists have at least one element.\n```\nList<List<Object>> listOfLists = Arrays.asList(\n        Arrays.asList(1, 2),\n        Arrays.asList(10, 20, 30),\n        Arrays.asList(100));\n\nList<List<Object>> result = listOfLists.stream()\n        .flatMap(subList -> listOfLists.stream()\n                .flatMap(subList2 -> listOfLists.stream()\n                        .filter(subList3 -> !subList.equals(subList2) && !subList2.equals(subList3) && !subList.equals(subList3))\n                        .map(subList3 -> Arrays.asList(subList.get(0), subList2.get(0), subList3.get(0)))))\n        .collect(Collectors.toList());\n\nresult.forEach(System.out::println);\n```\nThis solution uses three nested streams. The outermost stream iterates over the list of lists. The middle stream iterates over the list of lists again, but skips the current list. The innermost stream iterates over the list of lists again, but only keeps those lists that are not the same as the two outer lists. It then maps each of these lists to a new list that contains the first element of each of the three original lists. Finally, it collects all of these new lists into a single list.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that all sublists have at least one element. If this is not the case, you will need to add additional checks.\n\nAlso, this solution has a time complexity of O(n^3), which means it will be slow if the list of lists is large. If performance is a concern, you may need to consider a different approach.\n\nThis solution uses the Java 8 Stream API, which is available in Java 8 and later versions. If you are using an earlier version of Java, you may need to upgrade or find an alternative solution.\n\nPlease note that this solution uses the equals method to compare lists. If your lists contain custom objects, you may need to override the equals method to correctly compare the objects.\n\nThis solution also assumes that the lists do not contain duplicate elements. If the lists can contain duplicate elements, you will need to add additional checks to ensure that the resulting lists do not contain duplicate elements.\n\nPlease note that this solution uses the Java 8 Stream API, which is available in Java 8 and later versions.
