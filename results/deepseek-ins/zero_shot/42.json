If the file were an image I would do something like this normally to show all applications capable of viewing the image.Intent intent = new Intent();intent.setAction(android.content.Intent.ACTION_VIEW);intent.setDataAndType(Uri.fromFile(file), \"image/*\");context.startActivity(intent);However say I have an unknown file how could I list all applications able to view a file so the user can select the appropriate application to open the file in my application.I also need the titles listed in an arraylist if possible so I can list them in a listview. Thank you for any help with getting a list of applications capable of viewing a file===================================EditAlright well something easier how can i get the applications from the above intent into an arraylist i could just do image/* audio/* etc and add them all to a list and then list them in a listview and that would solve my problem\nPlease using this api: ApplicationInfo.loadIcon.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Android list applications that can view an unknown file: :Hi I'm working on an app where I need to list all types of applications able to open a file.

The flag FLAG_SYSTEM is used to exclude system applications.\n\nHowever, this will only give you the names of the applications. If you want to get the icons, you can use the loadIcon method of the PackageManager. Here is how you can modify the code:\n```java\nArrayList<AppInfo> appList = new ArrayList<AppInfo>();\nList<ApplicationInfo> packages = getPackageManager().getInstalledApplications(PackageManager.GET_META_DATA);\nfor (ApplicationInfo packageInfo : packages) {\n    if ((packageInfo.flags & ApplicationInfo.FLAG_SYSTEM) == 0) {\n        AppInfo app = new AppInfo();\n        app.setName(getPackageManager().getApplicationLabel(packageInfo).toString());\n        app.setIcon(getPackageManager().getApplicationIcon(packageInfo));\n        appList.add(app);\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this code, AppInfo is a custom class that has two properties: name and icon. You can create this class as follows:\n```java\npublic class AppInfo {\n    private String name;\n    private Drawable icon;\n\n    public String getName() {\n        return name;\n    }\n\n    public void setName(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n\n    public Drawable getIcon() {\n        return icon;\n    }\n\n    public void setIcon(Drawable icon) {\n        this.icon = icon;\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code will give you a list of AppInfo objects, each containing the name and icon of an application. You can then use this list to populate your ListView.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
