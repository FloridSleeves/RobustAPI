The read method returns the number of bytes read, or -1 if the end of the stream is reached. We then write the buffer to the ByteArrayOutputStream. After all bytes have been read and written, we convert the ByteArrayOutputStream to a byte array with the toByteArray method. This method is wrapped in a try-with-resources statement to ensure that the stream is closed after it is no longer needed. If an IOException occurs during the reading or writing process, it is caught and printed to the console, and an empty byte array is returned.\n\nNote: This code assumes that the input stream is not null. If the input stream could be null, you should add a null check before the while loop.\n\n```java\npublic static byte[] inputStreamToByteArray(InputStream inputStream) {\n    if (inputStream == null) {\n        return new byte[0];\n    }\n    try (ByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream()) {\n        byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\n        int length;\n        while ((length = inputStream.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n            baos.write(buffer, 0, length);\n        }\n        return baos.toByteArray();\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        e.printStackTrace();\n        return new byte[0];\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code will return an empty byte array if the input stream is null.\n<<<explanation>>>: This code reads the input stream byte by byte into a buffer.
