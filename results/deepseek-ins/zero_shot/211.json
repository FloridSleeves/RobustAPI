I'd try it if I could figure out how to get TelnetClient to send such commands.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: $CODE\n\nTelnetClient client = new TelnetClient();\nclient.setConnectTimeout(5000);\ntry {\n    client.connect(\"localhost\", 23);\n    InputStream in = client.getInputStream();\n    PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(client.getOutputStream(), true);\n\n    out.println(\"root\");\n    out.flush();\n\n    byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\n    int bytesRead = in.read(buffer);\n    String response = new String(buffer, 0, bytesRead);\n    System.out.println(response);\n\n    out.println(\"password\");\n    out.flush();\n\n    bytesRead = in.read(buffer);\n    response = new String(buffer, 0, bytesRead);\n    System.out.println(response);\n\n    client.disconnect();\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n\n$CODE\n\nThis code uses the TelnetClient from Apache Commons Net to connect to a telnet server, send the username \"root\", and read the response. It then sends the password \"password\" and reads the response. The read responses are then printed to the console.\n\n$EXPLANATION\n\nThe code uses the TelnetClient class from Apache Commons Net to establish a telnet connection to a server. The connect method is used to establish the connection, with the server's IP address and port number as arguments. The getInputStream and getOutputStream methods are used to get the input and output streams of the telnet session.\n\nThe username \"root\" is sent to the server using the PrintWriter's println method, followed by flush to ensure the data is sent immediately. The server's response is read from the input stream using the read method of the InputStream, and the response is converted to a String.\n\nThe password \"password\" is sent in the same way as the username. The server's response is read and printed to the console.\n\nFinally, the disconnect method is called to close the telnet session.\n\nPlease note that the server's response may vary depending on the server's configuration.\n\n$API\n\nThe code uses the TelnetClient class from Apache Commons Net, which provides the necessary methods for telnet connections. The InputStream's read method is used to read data from the server's response.\n\nThe PrintWriter class is used to send data to the server, and the flush method is used to ensure the data is sent immediately. The getInputStream and getOutputStream methods of the TelnetClient class are used to get the input and output streams of the telnet session.\n\nThe IOException is caught and handled to ensure that any errors during the telnet session are properly handled and not cause the program to crash.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n"}
