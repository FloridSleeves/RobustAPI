The animation stops after the first frame because the `animation.work()` method is not being called in the `animating()` method. You should call `animation.work()` in the `animating()` method to update the animation frame.\n\nHere is the corrected `animating()` method in the Explosion class:\n\n```java\npublic void animating() {\n    if (!animation.playedOnce()) {\n        animation.work();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis will ensure that the animation continues to play until all frames have been displayed.\n\nAlso, ensure that the `animation.setDelay(10)` is set to a value that is appropriate for your game. The delay value determines the speed of the animation. A smaller value will make the animation play faster, and a larger value will make it play slower.\n\nI hope this helps to resolve your issue.
