This exception is thrown by methods that have detected concurrent modification of an object when such modification is not permissible.\n\nIn your case, the error is thrown at this line:\n```java\nfor (Beam beam : beams) {\n    g2.drawImage(beam.getImage(), (int)beam.getX(), (int)beam.getY(), null);\n}\n```\nThis line is iterating over the `beams` ArrayList using an enhanced for loop. The `ConcurrentModificationException` is thrown if this iteration is done while the list is being modified by another thread.\n\nTo fix this, you can use an Iterator instead of an enhanced for loop. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```java\nIterator<Beam> iterator = beams.iterator();\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\n    Beam beam = iterator.next();\n    g2.drawImage(beam.getImage(), (int)beam.getX(), (int)beam.getY(), null);\n}\n```\n\nThis way, you're not modifying the list while you're iterating over it, which should prevent the `ConcurrentModificationException`.\n\nAlso, remember that you should not modify the list while iterating over it using an Iterator. If you need to remove elements from the list, you should use the Iterator's own remove method.\n\n```java\nIterator<Beam> iterator = beams.iterator();\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\n    Beam beam = iterator.next();\n    if (beam.getY() <= 0) {\n        iterator.remove();\n    } else {\n        g2.drawImage(beam.getImage(), (int)beam.getX(), (int)beam.getY(), null);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis way, you're not modifying the list while you're iterating over it, which should prevent the `ConcurrentModificationException`.\n\nI hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\n<<<code>>>:\n```java\nIterator<Beam> iterator = beams.iterator();\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\n    Beam beam = iterator.next();\n    if (beam.getY() <= 0) {\n        iterator.remove();\n    } else {\n        g2.drawImage(beam.getImage(), (int)beam.getX(), (int)beam.getY(), null);\n    }\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>:\nIn this code, we're using an Iterator to iterate over the `beams` ArrayList. We're checking if the beam's Y position is less than or equal to 0, and if it is, we remove it from the list using the Iterator's own remove method. If the beam's Y position is greater than 0, we draw it on the screen. This way, we're not modifying the list while we're iterating over it, which should prevent the `ConcurrentModificationException`.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>"}
