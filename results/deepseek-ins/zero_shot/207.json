It reads the next byte of data from the input stream. If no byte is available, it blocks until one is available. The value byte is returned as an int in the range 0 to 255. If the end of the stream is reached, the value -1 is returned. So, in the above code, we are reading the output of the process and printing it. The exit value of the process is printed separately.\n\nNote: The process should not be writing to the standard error stream (stderr) for this to work correctly. If the process is writing to stderr, you should use pr.getErrorStream() instead of pr.getInputStream().\n\nAlso, note that the process should be started with the command line arguments separated by spaces, as in your example.\n\nFinally, the process should not be writing to the standard output stream (stdout) when it is being read by the Java program. If the process is writing to stdout, you should use pr.getErrorStream() instead of pr.getInputStream().\n\nI hope this helps. Let me know if you have any further questions.\n\n\nA: The problem is that you are reading the input stream of the process, which is the output of the process, not the exit value. The exit value is returned by the waitFor() method, not read from the input stream.\n\nThe exit value is a general-purpose status code that is set by the operating system when the process terminates. It is not related to the output of the process.\n\nSo, you should use the exitVal variable to get the exit value of the process, not read it from the input stream.\n\nHere is the corrected code:\n\n```java\ntry {\n    Process pr = rt.exec(\"C:\\\\Users\\\\babesha.fm\\\\Desktop\\\\SUM.exe 10 5\");\n    int exitVal = pr.waitFor();\n    System.out.println(\"Exited with error code \" + exitVal);\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n} catch (InterruptedException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, the exitVal variable will hold the exit value of the process. If the process exits normally, the exitVal will be 0. If the process is terminated by an uncaught exception, the exitVal will be a non-zero value.\n\nIf you want to read the output of the process, you should use the getInputStream() method of the Process class to get an InputStream that reads the output of the process.\n\n```java\ntry {\n    Process pr = rt.exec(\"C:\\\\Users\\\\babesha.fm\\\\Desktop\\\\SUM.exe 10 5\");\n    InputStream is = pr.getInputStream();\n    int exitVal = pr.waitFor();\n    int c;\n    while ((c = is.read()) != -1) {\n        System.out.print((char) c);\n    }\n    System.out.println(\"Exited with error code \" + exitVal);\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n} catch (InterruptedException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, the while loop reads the output of the process and prints it. The exit value of the process is printed separately.\n\nNote: The process should not be writing to the standard error stream (stderr) for this to work correctly. If the process is writing to stderr, you should use pr"}
