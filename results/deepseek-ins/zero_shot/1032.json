I was thinking I could do something like nextToken() until the third.public class SpecialToken {    public static String thirdToken() {    }}\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: Here is the code:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.StringTokenizer;\n\npublic class SpecialToken {\n    public static String thirdToken(String str) {\n        StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(str);\n        String third = \"\";\n        int count = 0;\n        while (st.hasMoreTokens()) {\n            String token = st.nextToken();\n            count++;\n            if (count == 3) {\n                third = token;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        return third;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\nIn this code, we are using the StringTokenizer class to break the input string into tokens. We initialize a counter to keep track of the number of tokens we have processed. When we process the third token, we break the loop and return the token.\n\nThe parameter of the thirdToken method is the string that we want to break into tokens. This string is passed to the StringTokenizer constructor.\n\nThe method returns the third token of the string. If the string has less than 3 tokens, it returns an empty string.\n\nAPI:\n\n```java\nStringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(str);\nString third = \"\";\nint count = 0;\nwhile (st.hasMoreTokens()) {\n    String token = st.nextToken();\n    count++;\n    if (count == 3) {\n        third = token;\n        break;\n    }\n}\nreturn third;\n```\n\nThis code uses the StringTokenizer class to break the input string into tokens. It keeps track of the number of tokens processed with a counter. When it processes the third token, it breaks the loop and returns the token.\n```\n\nI hope this helps you understand the code and how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
