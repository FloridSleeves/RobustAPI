It only draws half of the tiles because we're not calling iterator.next() twice.\n\nNote: This will not halve the memory usage of your program, but it will halve the number of tiles that are drawn. If you're concerned about memory usage, you might want to consider using a different data structure that allows you to remove elements while iterating.\n\nAlso, if you're concerned about performance, you might want to consider using a for loop instead of a for-each loop. The for-each loop is more readable and less prone to errors, but it doesn't give you direct access to the index or the ability to modify the collection you're iterating over.\n\nIf you're using Java 8 or later, you can use the Stream API to achieve the same result in a more functional style:\n\n```java\ntiles.stream().limit(tiles.size() / 2).forEach(Tile::draw);\n```\n\nThis code will draw the first half of the tiles. The `limit` method is used to limit the number of elements that are processed by the `forEach` method.\n\nPlease note that this code will not halve the memory usage of your program, but it will halve the number of tiles that are drawn.
