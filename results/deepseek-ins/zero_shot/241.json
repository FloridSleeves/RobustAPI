Again, it doesn't seem print the returned values. If this code is ok, how could I check if the executable indeed return values? \nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nInputStream in = process.getInputStream();\nint i;\nwhile((i = in.read()) != -1){\n    System.out.print((char) i);\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: This code reads the output of the process one byte at a time and prints it to the console. The loop continues until the end of the stream is reached, which is indicated by the return value of -1 from the read() method.\n\nNote: This code assumes that the output of your MATLAB function is text and can be interpreted as such. If the output is binary data, you will need a different approach to read and process it.\n\nAlso, this code does not handle possible IOException that can be thrown by the read() method. In a production environment, you should add appropriate error handling.\n\nLastly, this code reads the output of the process as soon as it becomes available, which may not be the desired behavior if the process is producing output at a very high rate. You may want to use a separate thread to read the output in the background while the process is running.\n\nPlease note that the process.waitFor() method is not needed in this case because the read() method will block until data is available.\n\nIf you want to get the output as a string, you can use the following code:\n\n```java\nBufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(process.getInputStream()));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n```\n\nThis code uses a BufferedReader to read the output line by line, which is more efficient than reading one byte at a time.\n\nPlease replace the \"epidemic.exe\" with your actual executable file name.\n\nNote: The process.getErrorStream() is not used in this code because it is assumed that the error output of your MATLAB function is not important for your application. If there is any error output, it should be handled separately.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
