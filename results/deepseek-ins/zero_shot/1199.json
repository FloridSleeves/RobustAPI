Then I'm going to try to iterate through the array, taking 2 to the power of each position and adding them up. Maybe not the most efficient way to convert from binary to decimal, but it's what I came up with. \nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: Here's how you can do it:\n\n```java\nString binary = \"01110101\";\nString reversed = new StringBuilder(binary).reverse().toString();\n\nArrayList<Integer> positions = new ArrayList<Integer>();\n\nStringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(reversed, \"0\");\nwhile (st.hasMoreTokens()) {\n    String token = st.nextToken();\n    positions.add(reversed.length() - reversed.indexOf(token) - token.length());\n}\n\nint sum = 0;\nfor (int pos : positions) {\n    sum += Math.pow(2, pos);\n}\n\nSystem.out.println(sum);\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- We first reverse the binary string.\n- We then use a StringTokenizer to split the reversed string by \"0\". This gives us the positions of the ones in the original binary string.\n- We add these positions to an ArrayList.\n- Finally, we iterate through the ArrayList, taking 2 to the power of each position and adding them up. This gives us the decimal equivalent of the binary string.\n\nThis code will print `84`, which is the decimal equivalent of the binary string \"01110101\".\n\nNote: This code assumes that the binary string does not start with a zero. If it does, you would need to remove it before reversing.\n\nI hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\n```\n\n\nA: Here is a simple way to do it using Java:\n\n```java\nString binary = \"01110101\";\nint decimal = 0;\n\nfor(int i = 0; i < binary.length(); i++) {\n    if(binary.charAt(i) == '1') {\n        decimal += Math.pow(2, binary.length() - i - 1);\n    }\n}\n\nSystem.out.println(decimal);\n```\n\nThis code works by iterating over each character in the binary string. If the character is '1', it adds the value of 2 raised to the power of the position of the '1' in the binary string to the decimal variable. The position is calculated as the length of the binary string minus the current index minus one.\n\nThis will print `84`, which is the decimal equivalent of the binary string \"01110101\".\n\nNote: This code assumes that the binary string does not start with a zero. If it does, you would need to remove it before processing.\n\nI hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\n```\n\nThis code uses the String class's charAt method to access each character in the binary string. It then checks if the character is '1' and if so, adds the value of 2 raised to the power of the position of the '1' to the decimal variable. The position is calculated as the length of the binary string minus the current index minus one.\n\nFinally, it prints the decimal equivalent of the binary string. This code assumes that the binary string does not start with a zero. If it does, you would need to remove it before processing.\n\nI hope this helps.
