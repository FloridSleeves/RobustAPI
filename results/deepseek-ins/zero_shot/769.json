Problem: the file could easily reach the size of 100 MB. Every solution I tried ended with the \"java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space\". The problem is not reading the xml in general or the decoding process, but the size of the base64 block.I used jdom, dom4j and XMLStreamReader to access the xml file. However, as soon as I want to access the base64 content of the respective element I get the mentioned error. I also tried an xslt using saxon's base64Binary-to-octets function, but of course with the same result.Is there a way to stream this base64 encoded part into a file without getting the whole chunk in one single piece?Thanks for your hints,Andreas\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: decode large base64 from xml in java: OutOfMemory: :I need to write a base64 encoded element of an xml file into a separate file.

Then we use PrintWriter.write(new String(decodedBytes)) to write the byte array to a file.\n```\n\nA: You can use a BufferedOutputStream to write the decoded bytes to a file in chunks. This will prevent the whole decoded bytes array from being loaded into memory at once.\n\n```java\nString base64 = \"base64String\";\nbyte[] decodedBytes = Base64.getDecoder().decode(base64);\ntry (BufferedOutputStream out = new BufferedOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(\"output.bin\"))) {\n    out.write(decodedBytes);\n} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n```\n\nThis code will write the decoded bytes to the file in chunks, which should prevent the OutOfMemoryError.\n\nPlease replace \"base64String\" with your actual base64 string.\n\nNote: This code assumes that the base64 string is correctly formatted and does not contain any errors. If the base64 string is not correctly formatted, the Base64.getDecoder().decode(base64) method will throw an IllegalArgumentException.\n\nAlso, make sure that you have the necessary permissions to write to the file system. If you don't, you may get a FileNotFoundException or IOException.\n\nFinally, remember to close the BufferedOutputStream when you're done writing to the file. This can be done by using a try-with-resources statement, as shown in the code above. This will automatically close the BufferedOutputStream and its underlying OutputStream, preventing potential memory leaks.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
