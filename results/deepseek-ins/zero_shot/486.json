We use Stream API instead of Groovy's collection methods. We use Integer.parseInt to convert String to int, and then multiply by 2. The result is collected into a List and printed.\n\nA: Here is the equivalent Java code:\nimport java.util.stream.Collectors;\nimport java.util.Arrays;\n\npublic class X {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String[] n = new String[]{\"1\",\"2\",\"3\"};\n        Arrays.stream(n)\n              .map(v -> Integer.parseInt(v)*2)\n              .collect(Collectors.toList())\n              .forEach(System.out::println);\n    }\n}\n\nExplanation:\n\n*\n\n*The Arrays.stream method is used to convert the array to a Stream.\n\n*The map method is used to transform each element of the Stream. In this case, we're converting each String to an integer and then doubling it.\n\n*The collect method is used to collect the results into a List.\n\n*The forEach method is used to print each element of the List.\n\nNote: The Groovy equivalent of the Java code you provided would be:\ndef n = [\"1\",\"2\",\"3\"]\nn.stream().map(v -> Integer.parseInt(v)*2).collect(Collectors.toList()).forEach(System.out::println)\n\nThis Groovy code does the same thing as the Java code. It creates a Stream from the array, maps each element to its integer value and doubled, collects the results into a List, and then prints each element of the List.\n\nA: Here is the equivalent Java code:\nimport java.util.stream.Collectors;\nimport java.util.Arrays;\n\npublic class X {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String[] n = new String[]{\"1\",\"2\",\"3\"};\n        Arrays.stream(n)\n              .map(v -> Integer.parseInt(v)*2)\n              .collect(Collectors.toList())\n              .forEach(System.out::println);\n    }\n}\n\nExplanation:\n\n*\n\n*The Arrays.stream method is used to convert the array to a Stream.\n\n*The map method is used to transform each element of the Stream.
