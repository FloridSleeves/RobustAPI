In your client code, you're creating a buffer of size equal to the file size, which might be too large for your network and file transfer. You should consider using a smaller buffer size, such as 1024 bytes, to read and write data to the file.\n\nHere's how you can modify your client code:\n\n```java\nSocket client = new Socket(ip, port);\nOutputStream outStream = client.getOutputStream();\nFileInputStream fileStream = new FileInputStream(fileName);\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1024]; // Use a smaller buffer size\nint bytesRead = 0;\nSystem.out.println(\"Sending file: \" + fileName);\nwhile ((bytesRead = fileStream.read(buffer)) > 0) {\n    outStream.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);\n}\noutStream.close();\nfileStream.close();\nclient.close();\nreturn;\n```\n\nAnd your server code:\n\n```java\nServerSocket fileSocket = new ServerSocket(p);\nboolean rdy = false;\nwhile (!rdy) {\n    Socket client = fileSocket.accept();\n    String fileName = \"C:/\" + args[2];\n    String cmd = fileName + \"\\n\";\n    OutputStreamWriter sWriter = new OutputStreamWriter(client.getOutputStream());\n    sWriter.write(cmd, 0, cmd.length());\n    sWriter.flush();\n    InputStream inStream = client.getInputStream();\n    FileOutputStream fileStream = new FileOutputStream(fileName);\n    byte[] buffer = new byte[1024]; // Use a smaller buffer size\n    int bytesRead = 0;\n    while ((bytesRead = inStream.read(buffer)) > 0) {\n        fileStream.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);\n    }\n    fileStream.flush();\n    ta.append(\"File transfered\");\n    inStream.close();\n    fileStream.close();\n    rdy = true;\n}\nfileSocket.close();\nreturn;\n```\n\nBy using a smaller buffer size, you should be able to transfer larger files without encountering the issue of incomplete file transfers.\n\nPlease note that the buffer size you choose should be based on your network's capabilities and the size of the files you're transferring.\n\nAlso, ensure that you handle exceptions properly in your code. This is crucial for robustness and to prevent unexpected behavior.\n\nLastly, remember to close all resources (like the `ServerSocket`, `Socket`, `InputStream`, `OutputStream`, etc.) in your code after they've been used to prevent resource leaks.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>"}
