The BitmapFactory.decodeByteArray() method expects a byte array in a specific format, which is not the case with the byte array you're sending.\n\nThe byte array you're sending from Java to Android should be in the following format:\n\n- The first 4 bytes should be the \"magic number\" for a bitmap file, which is 0x42 0x4D 0x3A 0x00.\n- The next 4 bytes should be the size of the bitmap file in bytes.\n- The next 4 bytes should be the reserved bytes, which should be 0.\n- The next 4 bytes should be the offset to the start of the bitmap data.\n- The next 4 bytes should be the DIB header size, which should be 40.\n- The next 4 bytes should be the width of the bitmap in pixels.\n- The next 4 bytes should be the height of the bitmap in pixels.\n- The next 2 bytes should be the number of color planes, which should be 1.\n- The next 2 bytes should be the number of bits per pixel, which should be 32.\n- The next 4 bytes should be the compression method, which should be 0.\n- The next 4 bytes should be the image size in bytes.\n- The next 4 bytes should be the horizontal resolution in pixels per meter.\n- The next 4 bytes should be the vertical resolution in pixels per meter.\n- The next 4 bytes should be the number of colors in the color palette.\n- The next 4 bytes should be the number of important colors.\n- The rest of the byte array should be the bitmap data.\n\nSo, you need to modify your code to send the byte array in the correct format. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```java\n// Get the byte array from the BufferedImage\nbyte[] imgBytes = ((DataBufferByte)msg.getImage().getData().getDataBuffer()).getData();\n\n// Create a byte array with the correct format\nbyte[] bitmapBytes = new byte[14 + 40 + imgBytes.length];\n\n// Fill the byte array with the correct values\nbitmapBytes[0] = (byte)0x42;\nbitmapBytes[1] = (byte)0x4D;\nbitmapBytes[2] = (byte)0x3A;\nbitmapBytes[3] = (byte)0x00;\n\n// Fill the rest of the byte array with the correct values\n// ...\n\n// Write the byte array to the OutputStream\nout.write(bitmapBytes);\n```\n\nAnd on the Android side, you can use the BitmapFactory.decodeByteArray() method to create the Bitmap:\n\n```java\n// Read the byte array from the InputStream\nbyte[] bitmapBytes = new byte[imgSize];\nin.read(bitmapBytes);\n\n// Create the Bitmap\nBitmapFactory.Options imgOptions = new BitmapFactory.Options();\nimgOptions.inPreferredConfig = Bitmap.Config.ARGB_4444;\nBitmap img = BitmapFactory.decodeByteArray(bitmapBytes, 0, imgSize, imgOptions);\n```\n\nThis should solve your problem.\n\nPlease note that the byte array you're sending from Java to Android should be in the correct format as described above. If you're still getting null, it might be that the byte array you're sending is not in the correct format.\n\nAlso, please make sure that the byte array you're sending from Java to Android is not too large. The Android device has a limited amount of memory, so sending a large byte array might cause the device to run out of memory and crash.\n\nI hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
