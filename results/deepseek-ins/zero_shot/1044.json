Obviously I have to set up the variables so the string numbers are converted into an integers e.g.int one = 1, two = 2, three = 3, twelve = 12, thirty = 30, hundred = 100;My initial attempt is to create a loop where I have assigned a count to stop when all the numbers have been accumulated, though the loop keeps on adding the the first number.My question is, when I input the text using the scanner object, what loop is required to add the first (written) number and then move onto the second (written) number, which will be added to the sum variable?Thanks for your time and I hope that this question is easy to understand.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Loops required to to add up a sum of numbers written in text: :I am attempting a question from the Java tutorial where I have to create a program that output the sum of numbers from a sentence.

It then iterates over each word, converting it to an integer using a switch statement. The integer is then added to the sum.\n\nThis code assumes that the sentence is in English and the words are spelled out in full. If the sentence is in a different language or the words are spelled differently, the code will not work correctly.\n\nAlso, this code assumes that the sentence is well-formatted and does not contain any numbers that are not represented by the words \"one\", \"two\", \"three\", \"twelve\", \"thirty\", or \"hundred\". If the sentence contains such numbers, the code will not work correctly.\n\nIf you need to handle other languages or different spellings, you will need to use a more sophisticated method to parse the sentence, such as a natural language processing library.\n\nIf you need to handle numbers that are not represented by the words \"one\", \"two\", \"three\", \"twelve\", \"thirty\", or \"hundred\", you will need to add more cases to the switch statement.\n\nPlease note that this code is case-sensitive. If you want it to be case-insensitive, you can convert the token to lower case before the switch statement.\n\nAlso, this code does not handle numbers that are represented by multiple words, such as \"one hundred\" or \"two thousand\". If you need to handle these cases, you will need to add more code to handle these cases.\n\nI hope this helps, and let me know if you have any other questions.\n\n\nA: Here is a simple way to do it using a HashMap to map the words to their corresponding numbers.\n\n```java\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String sentence = \"one three two\";\n        Map<String, Integer> wordToNum = new HashMap<>();\n        wordToNum.put(\"one\", 1);\n        wordToNum.put(\"two\", 2);\n        wordToNum.put(\"three\", 3);\n        // Add more words if needed\n\n        StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(sentence);\n        int sum = 0;\n        while (st.hasMoreTokens()) {\n            String token = st.nextToken();\n            if (wordToNum.containsKey(token)) {\n                sum += wordToNum.get(token);\n            }\n        }\n\n        System.out.println(\"Sum: \" + sum);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, we first create a HashMap to map the words to their corresponding numbers. Then we use a StringTokenizer to break the sentence into words. For each word, we check if it is in the HashMap. If it is, we add the corresponding number to the sum. Finally, we print the sum.\n\nThis code assumes that the sentence is well-formatted and does not contain any numbers that are not represented by the words in the HashMap. If the sentence contains such numbers, the code will not work correctly.\n\nIf you need to handle other languages or different spellings, you will need to use a more sophisticated method to parse the sentence, such as a natural language processing library.\n\nPlease note that this code is case-sensitive. If you want it to be case-insensitive, you can convert the token to lower case before checking if it is in the HashMap.\n\nAlso, this code does not handle numbers that are represented by multiple words, such as \"one hundred\" or \"two thousand\".
