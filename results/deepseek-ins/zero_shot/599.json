Here's how you can do it:\n\n<<<api>>>: RecyclerView\n<<<code>>>:\n```java\nRecyclerView recyclerView = findViewById(R.id.recycler_view);\nrecyclerView.setLayoutManager(new LinearLayoutManager(this));\n\nList<String> data = new ArrayList<>();\nfor (int i = 0; i < 200; i++) {\n    data.add(\"Item \" + i);\n}\n\nRecyclerView.Adapter adapter = new RecyclerView.Adapter() {\n    @NonNull\n    @Override\n    public RecyclerView.ViewHolder onCreateViewHolder(@NonNull ViewGroup parent, int viewType) {\n        View view = LayoutInflater.from(parent.getContext()).inflate(R.layout.row_layout, parent, false);\n        return new RecyclerView.ViewHolder(view) {\n            @Override\n            public String toString() {\n                return super.toString();\n            }\n        };\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onBindViewHolder(@NonNull RecyclerView.ViewHolder holder, int position) {\n        holder.itemView.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {\n            @Override\n            public void onClick(View v) {\n                String item = data.get(position);\n                // Handle click event\n            }\n        });\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public int getItemCount() {\n        return data.size();\n    }\n};\nrecyclerView.setAdapter(adapter);\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: In this code, we first create a RecyclerView and set its layout manager to a LinearLayoutManager. We then create a list of data and add 200 items to it.\n\nNext, we create a RecyclerView.Adapter. In the onCreateViewHolder method, we inflate the layout for each row and return a ViewHolder. In the onBindViewHolder method, we set an OnClickListener on each row. When a row is clicked, we get the data item at the clicked position and handle the click event.\n\nFinally, we set the adapter of the RecyclerView to our custom adapter. This will populate the RecyclerView with the data and handle the click events for each row.\n\nThis approach allows you to handle a large number of clickable rows without having to write thousands of lines of redundant code.\n\nNote: This is a basic example and may need to be adjusted based on your specific requirements. For example, you may want to use a custom row layout, handle click events in a different way, or store more complex data in your list.\n\nAlso, remember to replace \"row_layout\" with the actual layout file for your rows.\n\nThis approach is more efficient and flexible than manually setting an OnClickListener for each row in the XML. It allows you to handle click events for a large number of rows dynamically without having to write a large number of lines of code.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>"}
