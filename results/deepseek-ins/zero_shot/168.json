(22 answers)                            Closed 3 years ago.I use InputStream to read some data, so I want to read characters until new line or '\\n'. \nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: $CODE\nInputStream in = ...; // assume this is initialized\nint c;\nStringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();\nwhile ((c = in.read()) != -1) {\n    if (c == '\\n') {\n        String line = builder.toString();\n        builder.setLength(0);\n        // process line\n    } else {\n        builder.append((char) c);\n    }\n}\nif (builder.length() > 0) {\n    String line = builder.toString();\n    // process last line\n}\n$EXPLANATION\nThe code reads characters from the InputStream one by one using the read() method. When it encounters a newline character ('\\n'), it treats the accumulated characters as a line and resets the StringBuilder. If the stream ends before a newline character is encountered, it treats the remaining characters as the last line.\n\n\nQuestion: How to read a file line by line in Java?\nAnswer: $CODE\nFile file = new File(\"path/to/file.txt\");\ntry (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file))) {\n    String line;\n    while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n        // process line\n    }\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n$EXPLANATION\nThe BufferedReader class in Java is used to read text from a character-input stream, buffering characters so as to provide for the efficient reading of characters, arrays, and lines. The readLine() method reads a line of text. It returns null if the end of the stream has been reached.\n\n\nQuestion: How to read a large file in Java?\nAnswer: $CODE\ntry (Stream<String> stream = Files.lines(Paths.get(\"path/to/file.txt\"))) {\n    stream.forEach(line -> {\n        // process line\n    });\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n$EXPLANATION\nThe Files.lines() method returns a Stream<String> that represents the lines of the file. The forEach() method is used to process each line. This approach is efficient for large files because it reads the file line by line, rather than loading the entire file into memory.\n\n\nQuestion: How to read a large file in Java using NIO?\nAnswer: $CODE\nPath path = Paths.get(\"path/to/file.txt\");\ntry (BufferedReader reader = Files.newBufferedReader(path)) {\n    String line;\n    while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {\n        // process line\n    }\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n$EXPLANATION\nThe Files.newBufferedReader() method returns a BufferedReader that reads text from a character-input stream, buffering characters so as to provide for the efficient reading of characters, arrays, and lines. The readLine() method reads a line of text. It returns null if the end of the stream has been reached. This approach is efficient for large files because it reads the file line by line, rather than loading the entire file into memory.\n\n\nQuestion: How to read a large file in Java using NIO.2?\nAnswer: $CODE\nPath path = Paths.get(\"path/to/file.txt\");\ntry (BufferedReader reader = Files.newBufferedReader(path)) {\n    String line;\n    while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {\n        // process line\n    }\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n$EXPLANATION\nThe Files.newBufferedReader() method returns a BufferedReader that reads text from a character-input stream, buffering characters so as to provide for the efficient reading of characters, arrays, and lines. The readLine() method reads a line of text. It returns null if the end of the stream has been reached. This approach is efficient for large files because it reads the file line by line, rather than loading the entire file into memory.\n\n\nQuestion: How to read a large file in Java using NIO.2 and parallel streams?\nAnswer: $CODE\nPath path = Paths.get(\"path/to/file.txt\");\ntry (Stream<String> lines = Files.lines(path)) {\n    lines.parallel().forEach(line -> {"}
