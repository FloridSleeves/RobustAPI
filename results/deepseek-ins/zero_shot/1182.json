Then, NetworkInterface.getByInetAddress(InetAddress ip) method is used to get the NetworkInterface object that represents the network interface associated with the IP address.\n\nThen you can use the NetworkInterface.getInetAddresses() method to get all the IP addresses associated with the network interface. You can then iterate over these IP addresses and check if the IP address of the request is within the range of the IP addresses.\n\nHere is an example of how you can do this:\n\n```java\nInetAddress ip = InetAddress.getByName(request.getRemoteAddr());\nNetworkInterface network = NetworkInterface.getByInetAddress(ip);\nEnumeration<InetAddress> addresses = network.getInetAddresses();\nwhile (addresses.hasMoreElements()) {\n    InetAddress addr = addresses.nextElement();\n    if (addr.getHostAddress().startsWith(\"10.217.\")) {\n        // IP address is within the range of 10.217.0.0/16\n        // Allow the request\n        return;\n    }\n}\n// IP address is not within the range of 10.217.0.0/16\n// Deny the request\n```\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the IP address of the request is associated with the same network interface as the IP addresses in the range of 10.217.0.0/16. If this is not the case, you may need to use a different method to determine the network interface associated with the IP address of the request.\n\nAlso, this code does not handle the case where the IP address of the request is not associated with any network interface. In this case, you may need to deny the request.\n\nPlease note that this code uses the NetworkInterface class, which is available only on Java 1.6 and later. If you are using an earlier version of Java, you may need to use a different method to determine the network interface associated with the IP address of the request.\n\nAlso, this code does not handle the case where the IP address of the request is not associated with any network interface. In this case, you may need to deny the request.\n\nPlease note that this code uses the NetworkInterface class, which is available only on Java 1.6 and later.
