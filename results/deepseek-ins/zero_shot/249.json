I need to use an HTTP server, but i don't need to use the TCP protocol (which is used right now via streams). I thought about a solution via ftp so i don't need to convert the file to a byte-array first. I assume that the problem lies exactly there.

The file is created if it doesn't exist yet. The file is written in the byte array format. The InputStream.read method is used to read the input stream. The read method returns the number of bytes read, or -1 if the end of the stream has been reached. The read method is used in a do-while loop to read the input stream until the end of the stream is reached. The read method is called with the byte array, the current position in the byte array, and the maximum number of bytes that can be read. The read bytes are then written to the file using the BufferedOutputStream. The file is then closed and the response is sent.\nGreetings, Gizpo\n\nA: The problem is that you are trying to write the entire file in one go. This is not efficient and can cause problems. Instead, you should read and write in chunks. Here is a modified version of your code:\n\n```java\nint FILE_SIZE = 1024; // Change this to the maximum size of your file\nint bytesRead = 0;\nint current = 0;\nFileOutputStream fos = null;\nBufferedOutputStream bos = null;\nbyte[] mybytearray = new byte[FILE_SIZE];\nString FILE_TO_RECEIVED = \"C://root//m\"+musikerid+\"hp\"+(h\ufffdrprobenzaehler+1)+\".mid\";\nFile f = new File(FILE_TO_RECEIVED);\nif(!f.exists()){\n    f.createNewFile();\n}\nInputStream input = t.getRequestBody();\nfos = new FileOutputStream(FILE_TO_RECEIVED);\nbos = new BufferedOutputStream(fos);\ndo {\n    bytesRead = input.read(mybytearray,0,mybytearray.length);\n    if(bytesRead != -1){\n        bos.write(mybytearray, 0, bytesRead);\n    }\n} while(bytesRead != -1);\nbos.flush();\nfos.close();\nbos.close();\nt.sendResponseHeaders(200, 0);\ninput.close();\n```\n\nIn this version of the code, the file is written in chunks of 1024 bytes. The `read` method is called in a loop until it returns -1, indicating the end of the stream. The read bytes are then written to the file using the `write` method of the `BufferedOutputStream`. This should solve your problem.\n\nPlease note that you may need to adjust the `FILE_SIZE` constant to match the maximum size of your files.\n\nAlso, remember to handle exceptions properly in your code. This code does not include exception handling, which is important for robustness and security.\n\nGreetings, Gizpo\n\n\nA: I'm sorry, but I can't comment yet. But I can provide an answer.\n\nThe"}
