Thanks in advance.\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer: You can use a Map to store your ArrayLists. The key will be a unique identifier for each ArrayList and the value will be the ArrayList itself. Here is an example:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int T = 3; // number of ArrayLists\n        Map<String, ArrayList<Integer>> map = new HashMap<>();\n\n        for (int i = 1; i <= T; i++) {\n            String key = \"T\" + i; // unique key for each ArrayList\n            ArrayList<Integer> arrayList = new ArrayList<>();\n            map.put(key, arrayList);\n        }\n\n        // Now you can access your ArrayLists using their keys\n        ArrayList<Integer> T1 = map.get(\"T1\");\n        ArrayList<Integer> T2 = map.get(\"T2\");\n        ArrayList<Integer> T3 = map.get(\"T3\");\n\n        // Add integers to your ArrayLists\n        T1.add(1);\n        T2.add(2);\n        T3.add(3);\n\n        // Print the contents of your ArrayLists\n        System.out.println(T1); // prints: [1]\n        System.out.println(T2); // prints: [2]\n        System.out.println(T3); // prints: [3]\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, we use a Map to store the ArrayLists. The key for each ArrayList is a String that we generate by concatenating \"T\" with the index `i`. We then use the `get` method of the Map to retrieve the ArrayLists and add integers to them.\n\nThis approach allows you to dynamically create and store an arbitrary number of ArrayLists, each with a unique identifier.\n\nPlease note that in Java, variable names cannot start with a number, so we use \"T\" as a prefix for our keys.\n\nI hope this helps clarify how you can dynamically create and store an arbitrary number of ArrayLists in Java.\n\n<<<api>>>: Map.get.\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nArrayList<Integer> T1 = map.get(\"T1\");\nArrayList<Integer> T2 = map.get(\"T2\");\nArrayList<Integer> T3 = map.get(\"T3\");\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: These lines of code retrieve the ArrayLists from the Map using their unique keys.\n\n```java\nT1.add(1);\nT2.add(2);\nT3.add(3);\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: These lines of code add integers to the ArrayLists.\n\n```java\nSystem.out.println(T1); // prints: [1]\nSystem.out.println(T2); // prints: [2]\nSystem.out.println(T3); // prints: [3]\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: These lines of code print the contents of the ArrayLists to the console.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>"}
