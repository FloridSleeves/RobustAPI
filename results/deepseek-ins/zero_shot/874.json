The parameters are:\n- table: The name of the table to query.\n- columns: An array of the columns to return. Pass null to get all columns.\n- selection: A filter declaring which rows to return. Pass null to get all rows.\n- selectionArgs: You may include ? placeholders in selection, which will be replaced by the values from selectionArgs. The values will be bound as Strings.\n- groupBy: A filter declaring how to group rows. Pass null to have no groups.\n- having: A filter declaring which group rows to include in the cursor. Pass null to have no restrictions.\n- orderBy: A sort order. Pass null for the default sort order.\n\nThe query() method returns a Cursor object, which is a lightweight data structure holding the result set of the query. You can use the Cursor to move through the result set and get the data.\n\nTo include the SQL file with the APK, you can put it in the assets folder. The assets folder is a special location in your Android project where you can put files that should be included in the APK. You can access these files using AssetManager.\n\nHere is how you can read a file from the assets folder:\n\n```java\nAssetManager assetManager = getAssets();\nInputStream inputStream = assetManager.open(\"file.sql\");\n```\n\nYou can then use this InputStream to create a SQLiteDatabase object and execute your query:\n\n```java\nSQLiteDatabase db = SQLiteDatabase.openDatabase(dbPath, null, SQLiteDatabase.OPEN_READONLY);\nString[] columns = {\"column1\", \"column2\"};\nCursor cursor = db.query(\"table_name\", columns, null, null, null, null, null);\n```\n\nFinally, you can use the Cursor to get the data and show it in your ListView:\n\n```java\nListView listView = findViewById(R.id.list_view);\nCursorAdapter cursorAdapter = new CursorAdapter(this, cursor, 0);\nlistView.setAdapter(cursorAdapter);\n```\n\nThis way, you can include the SQL file in the APK, read it from the assets folder, and show the data in your app.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
