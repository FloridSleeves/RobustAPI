But how do you do it in Java?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: You can use the java.net.NetworkInterface class to get the IP address of the gateway. Here is a simple example:\n\n<<<api>>>: java.net.NetworkInterface\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nimport java.net.*;\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws SocketException {\n        Enumeration<NetworkInterface> interfaces = NetworkInterface.getNetworkInterfaces();\n        while (interfaces.hasMoreElements()) {\n            NetworkInterface iface = interfaces.nextElement();\n            for (InterfaceAddress address : iface.getInterfaceAddresses()) {\n                if (address.getBroadcast() != null) {\n                    System.out.println(\"Gateway IP: \" + address.getBroadcast().getHostAddress());\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: This program uses the NetworkInterface class to get a list of all network interfaces on the system. It then iterates over each interface, getting a list of all IP addresses and broadcast addresses associated with that interface. The broadcast address is the IP address of the gateway.\n\nPlease note that this code will only work on systems where the default gateway is set.
