I need to same console output to be copied in the text file i.e line by line.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: outs.write(new1);\n<<<explanation>>>: This line of code is used to write the content of the variable 'new1' into the text file 'text123.txt'. The content is written as it is, without any modification. Therefore, the text will be copied line by line in the text file.\n\nQuestion: How to write the content of a string to a text file in Java?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: PrintWriter.println\n<<<code>>>: outs.println(new1);\n<<<explanation>>>: This line of code is used to write the content of the variable 'new1' into the text file 'text123.txt' and then it moves the cursor to the next line. Therefore, each line of the string 'new1' will be written in a new line in the text file.\n\nQuestion: How to close the PrintWriter?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: PrintWriter.close\n<<<code>>>: outs.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: This line of code is used to close the PrintWriter and release the resources it was using. After calling this method, you should not use the PrintWriter object anymore. If you try to write to the file after calling close, it will throw an IOException.\n\nQuestion: How to read the content of a text file in Java?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: String line; while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) { System.out.println(line); }\n<<<explanation>>>: This line of code is used to read the content of the text file line by line. It returns null when there is no more content to read. The readLine method returns a String containing the contents of the line, or null if there is no more content.\n\nQuestion: How to replace all occurrences of a specific string in a string?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: String.replaceAll\n<<<code>>>: String new1 = nospace.replaceAll(\"\\\\s+\", \" \");\n<<<explanation>>>: This line of code is used to replace all occurrences of a specific string in a string. In this case, it is used to replace all occurrences of one or more whitespace characters with a single space.\n\nQuestion: How to remove all HTML tags from a string in Java?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: String.replaceAll\n<<<code>>>: String nohtml = sb.toString().replaceAll(\"\\\\<.*?>\", \"\");\n<<<explanation>>>: This line of code is used to remove all HTML tags from a string. It uses a regular expression to match any sequence of characters that starts with \"<\" and ends with \">\", and replaces it with an empty string.\n\nQuestion: How to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from a string in Java?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: String.replaceAll\n<<<code>>>: String nospace = nohtml.replaceAll(\"^\\\\s+|\\\\s+$|\\\\s*(\\\\n)\\\\s*|(\\\\s)\\\\s*\", \"$1$2\");\n<<<explanation>>>: This line of code is used to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from a string. It uses a regular expression to match any sequence of whitespace characters at the beginning or end of the string, and replaces it with an empty string. The regular expression also matches sequences of whitespace characters that are surrounded by newline characters, and replaces them with a single newline character.\n\nQuestion: How to replace all tabs in a string with spaces in Java?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: String.replace\n<<<code>>>: String new1 = nospace.replace(\"\\t\", \" \");\n<<<explanation>>>: This line of code is used to replace all occurrences of a tab character (\"\\t\") in a string with a space character (\" \").\n\nQuestion: How to handle exceptions in Java?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: try-catch-finally\n<<<code>>>: try { // code that may throw an exception } catch (ExceptionType name) { // handle the exception } finally { // code to be executed no matter what }\n<<<explanation>>>: This block of code is used to handle exceptions in Java. The \"try\" block contains the code that may throw an exception. The \"catch\" block contains the code to handle the"}
