The iterator here is used to iterate over the keys of the JSONObject. The next() method returns the next element in the iteration. The returned object is cast to String as the keys in the JSONObject are Strings.\n\nQuestion: Extracting JSON value, which is an array: :I am trying to extract the value from a key-value pair in a JSONObect.
