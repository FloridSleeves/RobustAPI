I want to take separate values from it. If it is Array we can use  .get[2] ,.get[5] etc. for take 2nd and 5th value. But for LinkedHashMap<String, Double> how to do it. I used following code. But it print all the values contained in LinkedHashMap<String, Double>. I need to take separately.

The next() method returns the next element in the iteration. It returns null if there are no more elements in the iteration.\nIn the code, we are using it inside a while loop to iterate over the LinkedHashMap. The Map.Entry me1 is used to get the key and value from each entry in the LinkedHashMap. The key and value are then printed using System.out.print() and System.out.println().\n\nA: You can use the Iterator.next() method to get the next element in the iteration.
