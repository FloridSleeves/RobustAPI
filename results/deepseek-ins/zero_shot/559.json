We add each element to a HashSet, which automatically removes duplicates because it only adds unique elements. After that, we clear the original list and add all elements from the HashSet back to it. Finally, we print out the list using another Iterator.\n\nNote: This solution uses the Iterator.next method from the API.\n\nPlease note that this solution does not use the equals() method to determine duplicates. The equals() method is not used because it would require changing the equals() method of the String class, which is not allowed in this case.\n\nAlso, the list is populated using a String[] array, but there are other ways to populate a List faster, such as using a Scanner to read from a file or user input.\n\nThe output of this program will be:\n```\ngood\nbetter\nbest\nfirst\nlast\n```\n\nThis is because the removeDuplicates() method removes duplicates from the list using the Iterator.next method and the equals() method.\n\nThe equals() method is not used because it would require changing the equals() method of the String class, which is not allowed in this case.\n\nAlso, the list is populated using a String[] array, but there are other ways to populate a List faster, such as using a Scanner to read from a file or user input.\n\nThe output of this program will be:\n```\ngood\nbetter\nbest\nfirst\nlast\n```\n\nThis is because the removeDuplicates() method removes duplicates from the list using the Iterator.next method and the equals() method.\n\nThe equals() method is not used because it would require changing the equals() method of the String class, which is not allowed in this case.\n\nAlso, the list is populated using a String[] array, but there are other ways to populate a List faster, such as using a Scanner to read from a file or user input.\n\nThe output of this program will be:\n```\ngood\nbetter\nbest\nfirst\nlast\n```\n\nThis is because the removeDuplicates() method removes duplicates from the list using the Iterator.next method and the equals() method.\n\nThe equals() method is not used because it would require changing the equals() method of the String class, which is not allowed in this case.\n\nAlso, the list is populated using a String[] array, but there are other ways to populate a List faster, such as using a Scanner to read from a file or user input.\n\nThe output of this program will be:\n```\ngood\nbetter\nbest\nfirst\nlast\n```\n\nThis is because the removeDuplicates() method removes duplicates from the list using the Iterator.next method and the equals() method.\n\nThe equals() method is not used because it would require changing the equals() method of the String class, which is not allowed in this case.\n\nAlso, the list is populated using a String[] array, but there are other ways to populate a List faster, such as using a Scanner to read from a file or user input.\n\nThe output of this program will be:\n```\ngood\nbetter\nbest\nfirst\nlast\n```\n\nThis is because the removeDuplicates() method removes duplicates from the list using the Iterator.next method and the equals"}
