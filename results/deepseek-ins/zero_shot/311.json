This integer can be used to find the corresponding image format name using ImageIO.write(). The image format name can then be used as the file extension when saving the image.\n\n\nA: You can use ImageIO.read() to read the image from the URL and then use ImageIO.write() to write the image to a file. The format name can be obtained from the ImageIO.read() method.\nHere is an example:\nURL url = new URL(\"http://example.com/image.jpg\");\nBufferedImage image = ImageIO.read(url);\nString formatName = ImageIO.write(image, \"jpg\", new File(\"C:/path/to/save/image.\" + image.getType()));\n\nIn this code, the ImageIO.read() method reads the image from the URL and returns a BufferedImage object. The ImageIO.write() method then writes the image to a file. The format name is specified as \"jpg\" and the image type is used as the file extension.\nPlease note that the image.getType() method returns an integer that represents the type of the image.
