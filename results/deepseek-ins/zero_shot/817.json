The boolean operation is converting the result of the API call to a string and then writing that string to the file.\n\nA: The issue might be that the API you are using is returning a string representation of a boolean value, and you are trying to convert it back to a boolean in your Java code.\nTry changing this line:\nboolean result = Boolean.valueOf(reader.readLine());\n\nto:\nboolean result = \"true\".equals(reader.readLine());\n\nThis will compare the string representation of the boolean value returned by the API with the string \"true\", and return true if they match, false otherwise.\nAlso, ensure that the API is returning the correct boolean value. You can print the value returned by the API to verify this.\n\nA: The problem might be that the API you are using is returning a string representation of a boolean value, and you are trying to convert it back to a boolean in your Java code.\nTry changing this line:\nboolean result = Boolean.valueOf(reader.readLine());\n\nto:\nboolean result = \"true\".equals(reader.readLine());\n\nThis will compare the string representation of the boolean value returned by the API with the string \"true\", and return true if they match, false otherwise.\nAlso, ensure that the API is returning the correct boolean value. You can print the value returned by the API to verify this.\n\nA: It seems like the API you are using is returning a string representation of a boolean value. In your Java code, you are trying to convert it back to a boolean using Boolean.valueOf().\nInstead, you should compare the string representation of the boolean value with the string \"true\" using the equals() method. Here is how you can do it:\nboolean result = \"true\".equals(reader.readLine());\n\nThis will return true if the string representation of the boolean value is \"true\", and false otherwise.\n\nA: The issue might be that the API you are using is returning a string representation of a boolean value, and you are trying to convert it back to a boolean in your Java code.\nTry changing this line:\nboolean result = Boolean.valueOf(reader.readLine());\n\nto:\nboolean result = \"true\".equals(reader.readLine());\n\nThis will compare the string representation of the boolean value returned by the API with the string \"true\", and return true if they match, false otherwise.\nAlso, ensure that the API is returning the correct boolean value.
