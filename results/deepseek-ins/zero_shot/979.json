The output will be the same because the same input will always produce the same output for a given key. If you want to see different output, you need to use a different input string.\n\nA: The problem is that you are using the same input string \"john doe\" for both encryption and decryption. The output will be the same because the same input will always produce the same output for a given key. If you want to see different output, you need to use a different input string.\n\nA: The DES algorithm is a symmetric encryption algorithm, which means the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. In your case, you are using the same key for both encryption and decryption, hence you get the same output.\nIf you want to see different output, you need to use a different key for decryption.\nHere is an example:\nString algorithm = \"DES\";\nSecretKeyFactory keyFactory = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(algorithm);\nbyte[] encBytes = \"12345678\".getBytes(\"UTF8\");\nbyte[] decBytes = \"87654321\".getBytes(\"UTF8\"); // Changed the decryption key\nDESKeySpec keySpecEncrypt = new DESKeySpec(encBytes);\nDESKeySpec keySpecDecrypt = new DESKeySpec(decBytes);\nSecretKey keyEncrypt = keyFactory.generateSecret(keySpecEncrypt);\nSecretKey keyDecrypt = keyFactory.generateSecret(keySpecDecrypt);\nCipher cipherEncrypt = Cipher.getInstance(algorithm);\nCipher cipherDecrypt = Cipher.getInstance(algorithm);\nString input = \"john doe\";\ncipherEncrypt.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, keyEncrypt);\nbyte[] inputBytes = cipherEncrypt.doFinal(input.getBytes());\nSystem.out.println(\"inputBytes: \" + new String(inputBytes));\ncipherDecrypt.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, keyDecrypt);\nbyte[] outputBytes = cipherDecrypt.doFinal(inputBytes);\nSystem.out.println(\"outputBytes: \" + new String(outputBytes));\n\nIn this example, the decryption key is different from the encryption key. So, the output will be different.\n\nA: The DES algorithm is a symmetric encryption algorithm, which means the same key is used for both encryption and decryption.
