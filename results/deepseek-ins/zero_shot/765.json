Also, you are creating a new PrintWriter and Scanner for the same file which you are reading from. You should use the same PrintWriter for writing to the file. Here is the corrected code:\npublic class FileConverter {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);\n        System.out.println(\"Enter the filename for the first file\");\n        String filename = keyboard.nextLine();\n        File file = new File(filename);\n        Scanner inputFile = new Scanner(file);\n        StringBuilder uppercaseinfo = new StringBuilder();\n        while (inputFile.hasNext()) {\n            String fileinfo = inputFile.nextLine();\n            uppercaseinfo.append(fileinfo.toUpperCase()).append(\"\\n\");\n        }\n        System.out.print(\"Enter the filename for the second file\");\n        filename = keyboard.nextLine();\n        PrintWriter outputFile = new PrintWriter(filename);\n        outputFile.write(uppercaseinfo.toString());\n        outputFile.close();\n    }\n}\n\nThis code reads the first file, converts the text to uppercase, and then writes the uppercase text to the second file. The PrintWriter is closed after writing to the file to ensure that all data is written to the file.\n\nA: You are creating a new PrintWriter for the same file that you are reading from.
