When you close the PrintWriter, it also closes the underlying output stream. This in turn closes the socket, and any subsequent read operation will fail.\n\nOn the other hand, when you use the shutdownOutput() method of the socket, it only closes the output stream channel of the socket. The socket remains open and can be used for reading and writing. Therefore, the subsequent read operation will not fail.\n\nSo, the key difference is that closing the PrintWriter closes the entire socket, while shutdownOutput() only closes the output stream channel of the socket.\n\nIn conclusion, if you want to close the output stream without closing the socket, you should use the shutdownOutput() method.\n\nHere is the code example:\n\n```java\nSocket socket = new Socket(\"localhost\", 12345);\nPrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true);\nout.println(\"Hello, Server!\");\nout.close(); // This will close the socket if you use this line\n// socket.shutdownOutput(); // This will only close the output stream\n```\n\nIn this code, if you uncomment the line `out.close()`, the socket will be closed, and any subsequent read operation will fail. But if you uncomment the line `socket.shutdownOutput()`, the output stream will be closed, but the socket will remain open, and the subsequent read operation will not fail.\n\nSo, the key difference is that closing the PrintWriter closes the entire socket, while shutdownOutput() only closes the output stream channel of the socket.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
