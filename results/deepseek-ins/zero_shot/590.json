To retrieve the account number, we use the get method of ArrayList with index 0.\n\nQuestion: Retrieving element from 2D ArrayList:\nAnswer: $CODE: t[0][0].get(0)\n$EXPLANATION: The account number is being added to the ArrayList at index 0. To retrieve the account number, we use the get method of ArrayList with index 0.\n\nQuestion: Updating element in 2D ArrayList:\nAnswer: $CODE: t[0][1].set(0, newBalance);\n$EXPLANATION: The balance of an account can be updated by using the set method of ArrayList. The first parameter is the index of the element to be updated and the second parameter is the new value. In this case, we are updating the balance of the first account (index 0) to newBalance.\n\nQuestion: Deleting element from 2D ArrayList:\nAnswer: $CODE: t[0][0].remove(0);\n$EXPLANATION: The account number can be removed from the ArrayList by using the remove method of ArrayList. The parameter is the index of the element to be removed. In this case, we are removing the account number of the first account (index 0).\n\nQuestion: Checking if an element exists in 2D ArrayList:\nAnswer: $CODE: t[0][0].contains(accountNo);\n$EXPLANATION: To check if an account number exists in the ArrayList, we use the contains method of ArrayList. It returns true if the account number is found in the ArrayList, and false otherwise.\n\nQuestion: Getting the size of 2D ArrayList:\nAnswer: $CODE: t[0][0].size();\n$EXPLANATION: The size of the ArrayList can be obtained by using the size method of ArrayList. It returns the number of elements in the ArrayList. In this case, we are getting the size of the ArrayList at index 0.\n\nQuestion: Iterating over 2D ArrayList:\nAnswer: $CODE: for(int i=0; i<t[0][0].size(); i++) { System.out.println(t[0][0].get(i)); }\n$EXPLANATION: To iterate over the ArrayList, we use a for loop. The size method of ArrayList is used to get the number of elements in the ArrayList, and the get method is used to retrieve each element. In this case, we are printing each account number in the ArrayList.\n\nQuestion: Checking if 2D ArrayList is empty:\nAnswer: $CODE: t[0][0].isEmpty();\n$EXPLANATION: To check if the ArrayList is empty, we use the isEmpty method of ArrayList. It returns true if the ArrayList is empty (i.e., it has no elements), and false otherwise. In this case, we are checking if the ArrayList at index 0 is empty.\n\nQuestion: Clearing all elements from 2D ArrayList:\nAnswer: $CODE: t[0][0].clear();\n$EXPLANATION: To clear all elements from the ArrayList, we use the clear method of ArrayList. This removes all elements from the ArrayList, making its size 0. In this case, we are clearing the ArrayList at index 0.\n\nQuestion: Adding multiple elements to 2D ArrayList:\nAnswer: $CODE: t[0][0].addAll(Arrays.asList(accountNos));\n$EXPLANATION: To add multiple elements to the ArrayList, we use the addAll method of ArrayList. The parameter is a Collection containing the elements to be added. In this case, we are adding multiple account numbers to the ArrayList at index 0.\n\nQuestion: Removing multiple elements from 2D ArrayList:\nAnswer: $CODE: t[0][0].removeAll(Arrays.asList(accountNos));\n$EXPLANATION: To remove multiple elements from the ArrayList, we use the removeAll method of ArrayList. The parameter is a Collection containing the elements to be removed. In this case, we are removing multiple account numbers from the ArrayList at index 0.\n\nQuestion: Retaining only elements from 2D ArrayList:\nAnswer: $CODE: t[0][0].retainAll(Arrays.asList(accountNos));\n$EXPLANATION: To retain only the elements from the ArrayList"}
