In Java, static methods can only be called on the class itself, not on instances of the class. You should make the method getNumberOfViolins() static as well.\n\nHere is the corrected code:\n\nFile #1:\n```java\npublic class ViolinGonzalezAP3 {\n    public static int numberOfStrings = 4;\n    public static char[] stringNames = {'E', 'A', 'D', 'G'};\n    public boolean isTuned = false;\n    public boolean isPlaying = false;\n    public static int numberOfViolins = 0;\n\n    public ViolinGonzalezAP3(){\n        numberOfViolins++;\n    }\n\n    public void startPlaying() {\n        isPlaying = true;\n        System.out.println(\" violin is now playing.\");\n    }\n\n    public void stopPlaying() {\n        isPlaying = false;\n        System.out.println(\" violin has stopped playing.\");\n    }\n\n    public void tuneOn() {\n        isTuned = true;\n        System.out.println(\" violin is now tuned.\");\n    }\n\n    public void tuneOff() {\n        isTuned = false;\n        System.out.println(\" violin is untuned.\");\n    }\n\n    public static int getNumberOfViolins(){\n        return numberOfViolins;\n    }\n\n    public static int getNumberOfStrings(){\n        return numberOfStrings;\n    }\n\n    public static char[] notes(){\n        return stringNames;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFile #2:\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.Arrays;\n\npublic class ViolinDriverGonzalezAP3 {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception{\n        File file = new File(\"Java violinOutput.txt\");\n        PrintWriter output = new PrintWriter(file);\n        ViolinGonzalezAP3[] violinAmount = new ViolinGonzalezAP3[10];\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < violinAmount.length; i++){\n            violinAmount[i] = new ViolinGonzalezAP3();\n            System.out.println(ViolinGonzalezAP3.getNumberOfViolins() + \" Violin\");\n            output.println(ViolinGonzalezAP3.getNumberOfViolins() + \" object:\");\n            violinAmount[i].tuneOff();\n            output.println(\"The violin is now tunning...\");\n            violinAmount[i].tuneOn();\n            output.println(\"The violin is now playing...\");\n            violinAmount[i].startPlaying();\n            output.println(\"String numbers is \" + ViolinGonzalezAP3.getNumberOfStrings() + \" with String names are \" + Arrays.toString(ViolinGonzalezAP3.notes()));\n            output.println(\"The violin is now stopped\");\n            violinAmount[i].stopPlaying();\n        }\n        output.close();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this corrected code, I made the method getNumberOfViolins() static, so it can be called on the class ViolinGonzalezAP3 directly.\n\nI hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\n<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: output.println(\"The violin is now tunning...\");\n<<<explanation>>>: This line is writing the string \"The violin is now tunning...\" to the file.\n\n<<<api>>>: Arrays.toString(ViolinGonzalezAP3.notes())\n<<<code>>>: Arrays.toString(ViolinGonzalezAP3.notes())\n<<<explanation>>>: This line is converting the array returned by the notes() method of the ViolinGonzalezAP3 class to a string.
