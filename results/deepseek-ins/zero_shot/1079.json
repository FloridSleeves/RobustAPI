This is because StringTokenizer.nextElement() throws a NoSuchElementException if there are no more tokens. On the other hand, StringTokenizer.nextToken() returns a zero-length string if there are no more tokens. So, we use hasMoreTokens() to check if there are more tokens left. Also, we append the closing parenthesis after the last token, not before.\n\n\nA: The issue is that you are calling token.nextElement() twice in a row in your while loop. This means that you are skipping every other token. You should call token.nextToken() instead, which returns the next token from the string tokenizer.\n\nHere is the corrected code:\n\n```java\nString listFromProperties = getPropertyValue(\"propagateList\");\nStringTokenizer token = new StringTokenizer(listFromProperties, \",\");\nStringBuilder partialListString = new StringBuilder();\npartialListString.append(\" AND (key=\");\nwhile (token.hasMoreTokens()) {\n    partialListString.append(token.nextToken());\n    if (token.hasMoreTokens()) {\n        partialListString.append(\" OR \");\n    }\n}\npartialListString.append(\")\");\nreturn partialListString.toString();\n```\n\nThis code will correctly add the \"OR\" condition for each key in the list. It will also correctly add the closing parenthesis after the last key.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the list of keys is comma-separated in the properties file. If the keys are not comma-separated, you will need to adjust the code accordingly.\n\nAlso, please note that this code does not handle any potential issues with the input string. If the input string is not properly formatted, the code may not work as expected. You may want to add some error checking code to handle these cases.\n\nLastly, please note that the use of StringTokenizer is generally considered to be outdated and it's recommended to use the newer and more powerful classes in the java.util.regex package or the java.util.streams package instead.\n\nI hope this helps, and let me know if you have any other questions.\n\n\nA: You are using StringTokenizer which is a legacy class. It is recommended to use the Scanner class for parsing the string.\nHere is the code:\n```java\nString listFromProperties = getPropertyValue(\"propagateList\");\nScanner scanner = new Scanner(listFromProperties).useDelimiter(\",\");\nStringBuilder partialListString = new StringBuilder();\npartialListString.append(\" AND (key=\");\nwhile (scanner.hasNext()) {\n    partialListString.append(scanner.next());\n    if (scanner.hasNext()) {\n        partialListString.append(\" OR \");\n    }\n}\npartialListString.append(\")\");\nreturn partialListString.toString();\n```\nThis code will work as expected. The Scanner class is more powerful and flexible than StringTokenizer. It can handle a variety of delimiters and can parse complex strings more easily.\n\nA: You can use Java 8 Stream API to simplify your code.\n\n```java\nString listFromProperties = getPropertyValue(\"propagateList\");\nString[] keys = listFromProperties.split(\",\");\nString partialListString = Arrays.stream(keys)\n        .map(key -> \"key=\" + key)\n        .collect(Collectors.joining(\" OR \", \" AND (\", \")\"));\nreturn partialListString;\n```\n\nThis code splits the list of keys by comma, then maps each key to \"key=\" + key, and finally joins them with \" OR \" as a delimiter.
