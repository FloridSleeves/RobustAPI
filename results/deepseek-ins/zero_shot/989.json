Why is it ? How can I print it in the proper string format ?\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer: The problem is that the Blowfish cipher encrypts data in bytes, not characters. When you try to convert the encrypted bytes to a string, it uses the default encoding of the JVM, which may not be suitable for all types of data.\n\nYou can use the `Base64` encoding to convert the bytes to a string that can be safely stored and transferred. Here is how you can modify your code:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Base64;\n\n...\n\nbyte[] encrypted = cipher.doFinal(input.getBytes());\nString s = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(encrypted);\nSystem.out.println(s);\n```\n\nThis will print the encrypted data in a format that can be easily stored and transferred.\n\nNote: The `Base64` class is available from Java 8. If you're using an older version of Java, you can use the `sun.misc.BASE64Encoder` class instead.\n\n```java\nimport sun.misc.BASE64Encoder;\n\n...\n\nbyte[] encrypted = cipher.doFinal(input.getBytes());\nBASE64Encoder encoder = new BASE64Encoder();\nString s = encoder.encode(encrypted);\nSystem.out.println(s);\n```\n\nBoth of these methods will give you a string that looks something like this: \"3q2+7w==\".\n\nRemember that `Base64` encoding is not suitable for all types of data. It's most commonly used for binary data, but it can also be used for text data. If you're using it for text data, you might want to consider using a different encoding that's suitable for your data.\n\nAlso, be aware that `Base64` encoding increases the size of your data by about 33%, so it's not suitable for all types of data. If you're working with large amounts of data, you might want to consider other methods of storing and transferring your data.\n\nFinally, remember that the `Base64` class is not part of the standard Java API, so it's not available in all environments. If you're using an older version of Java, you might need to use the `sun.misc.BASE64Encoder` class instead.\n\n```java\nimport sun.misc.BASE64Encoder;\n\n...\n\nbyte[] encrypted = cipher.doFinal(input.getBytes());\nBASE64Encoder encoder = new BASE64Encoder();\nString s = encoder.encode(encrypted);\nSystem.out.println(s);\n```\n\nThis will print the encrypted data in a format that can be easily stored and transferred.\n\nNote: The `Base64` class is available from Java 8.
