The random index is generated by calling rand.nextInt(images.length). This will give us a random index between 0 and the length of the array. We then add the image at this index to the corresponding list.\nFinally, we are converting the lists back to arrays by using the Stream API's mapToInt and toArray methods.\nThis will give us two int arrays array1 and array2 which contain 4 random images from the two arrays. The images in array1 and array2 will be the same corresponding images from the other array.\n\nNote: The images in array1 and array2 will be different because we are selecting them randomly from the two arrays. If you want to select the images in the same position from the two arrays, you can just use the same loop but without the random index.\n\nAlso, make sure to import the necessary classes (Random, List, ArrayList, Stream, etc.) at the beginning of your code.\n\nThis solution should work for your problem.
