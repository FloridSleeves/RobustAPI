Basically I have a string with 4 words in it, with each word seperated by a #. What I need to do is use the substring method to extract each word and print it out. I am having trouble figuring out the parameters for it though. I can always get the first one right, but the following ones generally have problems.Here is the first piece of the code:word = format.substring( 0 , format.indexOf('#') );Now from what I understand this basically means start at the beginning of the string, and end right before the #. So using the same logic, I tried to extract the second word like so:wordTwo = format.substring ( wordlength + 1 , format.indexOf('#') ); //The plus one so I don't start at the #.But with this I continually get errors saying it doesn't exist. I figured that the compiler was trying to read the first # before the second word, so I rewrote it like so:wordTwo = format.substring (wordlength + 1, 1 + wordLength + format.indexOf('#') );And with this it just completely screws it up, either not printing the second word or not stopping in the right place. If I could get any help on the formatting of this, it would be greatly appreciated. Since this is for a class, I am limited to using very basic methods such as indexOf, length, substring etc. so if you could refrain from using anything to complex that would be amazing! \nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Finding multiple substrings using boundaries in Java: :Alright so here is my problem.

In this case, we are using it to break the string 'format' into tokens at each '#' character. The 'hasMoreTokens()' method is used to check if there are more tokens left in the string. If there are, 'nextToken()' is used to get the next token. This is then printed out. This process is repeated until all tokens have been printed.\n\nNote: The StringTokenizer class is deprecated in Java 8 and removed in Java 9. If you are using Java 9 or later, you should use the split() method of the String class instead.\n\nCODE: \nString format = \"word1#word2#word3#word4\";\nString[] words = format.split(\"#\");\n\nfor (String word : words) {\n    System.out.println(word);\n}\n\nEXPLANATION: \nThe split() method of the String class is used to split a string into an array of substrings. In this case, we are using it to split the string 'format' into substrings at each '#' character. The resulting array is then printed out. This process is repeated until all substrings have been printed.\n\nNote: The split() method returns an array of substrings, so you don't need to use a loop to print them out. You can directly print the array using Arrays.toString() method.\n\nCODE: \nString format = \"word1#word2#word3#word4\";\nint wordCount = 0;\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < format.length(); i++) {\n    if (format.charAt(i) == '#') {\n        wordCount++;\n    }\n}\n\nfor (int i = 0; i <= wordCount; i++) {\n    int start = format.indexOf(\"#\") + 1;\n    int end = format.indexOf(\"#\", start);\n    if (end == -1) {\n        end = format.length();\n    }\n    System.out.println(format.substring(start, end));\n}\n\nEXPLANATION: \nIn this code, we first count the number of '#' characters in the string to determine the number of words. Then, we use a loop to extract each word by finding the start and end indices of each word using the indexOf() method. The substring() method is used to extract the word from the string. The process is repeated until all words have been printed.\n\nNote: This code assumes that there are no consecutive '#' characters. If there are, the words will be empty strings.\n\nCODE: \nString format = \"word1#word2#word3#word4\";\nint start = 0;\n\nwhile (start < format.length()) {\n    int end = format.indexOf('#', start);\n    if (end == -1) {\n        end = format.length();\n    }\n    System.out.println(format.substring(start, end));\n    start = end + 1;\n}\n\nEXPLANATION: \nIn this code, we use a while loop to extract each word by finding the start and end indices of each word using the indexOf() method. The substring() method is used to extract the word from the string. The process is repeated until all words have been printed. The variable 'start' is used to keep track of the current position in the string.\n\nNote: This code assumes that there are no consecutive '#' characters. If there are, the words will be empty strings.\n\nCODE: \nString format = \"word1#word2#word3#word4\";\nint start = 0;\n\nfor (int end = 0; end < format.length(); end++) {\n    if (format.charAt(end) == '#') {\n        System.out.println(format.substring(start, end));\n        start = end + 1;\n    }"}
