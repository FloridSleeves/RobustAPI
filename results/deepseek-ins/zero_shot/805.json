How do I create a new text file (if not existing already), how do I write to it and how do I read from it? Tried to learn it by myself but I've seen so many ways on the Internet and got confused.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:\n<<<api>>>: File file = new File(\"db.txt\");\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter writer;\nif (!file.exists()) {\n    file.createNewFile();\n}\nwriter = new PrintWriter(file, \"UTF-8\");\nwriter.println(\"Your string to write\");\nwriter.close();\n\n<<<explanation>>>: Firstly, we create a new File object with the name \"db.txt\". Then we check if the file exists. If it doesn't, we create a new file with the name \"db.txt\". After that, we create a new PrintWriter object with the file and the encoding \"UTF-8\". Then we write a string to the file using the println method. Finally, we close the writer.\nTo read from the file, you can use a Scanner object:\n<<<api>>>: Scanner scanner = new Scanner(file);\n<<<code>>>: while (scanner.hasNextLine()) {\n    String line = scanner.nextLine();\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\nscanner.close();\n\n<<<explanation>>>: Firstly, we create a new Scanner object with the file. Then we check if there is another line in the file. If there is, we read the line and print it. We repeat this until there are no more lines. Finally, we close the scanner.\nNote: Make sure to handle the IOException that can be thrown when creating a new file.\n\nA: Here is a simple example of how you can write to a file and read from it in Java:\n\nWriting to a file:\n\n```java\nimport java.io.FileWriter;\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.io.PrintWriter;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        try {\n            FileWriter fileWriter = new FileWriter(\"db.txt\");\n            PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(fileWriter);\n\n            String[] lines = {\"Line 1\", \"Line 2\", \"Line 3\"};\n\n            for (String line : lines) {\n                printWriter.println(line);\n            }\n\n            printWriter.close();\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nReading from a file:\n\n```java\nimport java.io.BufferedReader;\nimport java.io.FileReader;\nimport java.io.IOException;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        try {\n            FileReader fileReader = new FileReader(\"db.txt\");\n            BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(fileReader);\n\n            String line;\n            while ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) {\n                System.out.println(line);\n            }\n\n            bufferedReader.close();\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the first code snippet, we're creating a new file called \"db.txt\" and writing three lines of text to it. In the second code snippet, we're reading the file and printing each line to the console.\n\nPlease note that these examples assume that the file \"db.txt\" is in the same directory as your Java class. If it's not, you'll need to provide the full path to the file.\n\nAlso, don't forget to handle the IOException that can be thrown when creating a new file or reading from it.\n\n\nA: Here is a simple example of how you can write to a file and read from it in Java:\n\nWriting to a file:\n\n```java\nimport java.io.FileWriter;\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.io.PrintWriter;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        try {\n            FileWriter fileWriter = new FileWriter(\"db.txt\");\n            PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(fileWriter);\n\n            String[] lines = {\"Line 1\", \"Line 2\", \"Line 3\"};\n\n            for (String line : lines) {\n                printWriter.println(line);\n            }\n\n            printWriter.close();\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n       "}
