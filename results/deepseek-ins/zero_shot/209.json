Can it be done?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: java.io.InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nURL url = new URL(\"http://example.com/playlist.pls\");\nURLConnection connection = url.openConnection();\nInputStream inputStream = connection.getInputStream();\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\nint bytesRead;\nwhile ((bytesRead = inputStream.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n    // process the buffer\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: The code above reads the content of the .pls file from the URL and processes it byte by byte. The `inputStream.read(buffer)` method reads up to `buffer.length` bytes of data from the input stream into the buffer. The method returns the total number of bytes read into the buffer, or -1 if there is no more data because the end of the stream has been reached.\n\nPlease note that this code will only read the content of the .pls file and you still need to parse the content to extract the URLs.\n\nAlso, please note that this code does not handle network errors or exceptions. You should add appropriate error handling code to handle these situations.\n\nFinally, remember to close the input stream when you're done with it to free up system resources. You can do this by calling `inputStream.close()`.\n\nI hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\n\nA: I'm not sure if you're asking for a way to read the .pls file or a way to stream the URLs from the .pls file.\n\nReading the .pls file:\nYou can use a BufferedReader to read the .pls file line by line. Here is a simple example:\n\n```java\nBufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"path_to_your_file.pls\"));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {\n    // process the line\n}\n```\n\nThis will give you the content of the .pls file line by line. You can then parse the lines to extract the URLs.\n\nStreaming the URLs:\nOnce you have the URLs, you can use the Java Media Framework (JMF) to stream the URLs. Here is a simple example:\n\n```java\nURL url = new URL(\"http://example.com\");\nURLConnection connection = url.openConnection();\nInputStream inputStream = connection.getInputStream();\nAudioInputStream audioInputStream = AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream(inputStream);\nAudioFormat format = audioInputStream.getFormat();\nDataLine.Info info = new DataLine.Info(SourceDataLine.class, format);\nSourceDataLine line = (SourceDataLine) AudioSystem.getLine(info);\nline.open(format);\nline.start();\nint nBytesRead = 0;\nbyte[] abData = new byte[512];\nwhile (nBytesRead != -1) {\n    nBytesRead = audioInputStream.read(abData, 0, abData.length);\n    if (nBytesRead != -1)\n        line.write(abData, 0, nBytesRead);\n}\nline.drain();\nline.close();\n```\n\nThis will stream the audio from the URL and play it using the system's default audio device.\n\nPlease note that this is a very basic example and may not work for all URLs. You may need to handle network errors and exceptions, and you may need to adjust the code to suit your needs.\n\nI hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\n\nA: Here is a simple example of how to read a .pls file and extract the URLs. This example uses Java's built-in `java.util.Scanner` class to read the file line by line.\n\n```java\nimport java.io.File;\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\n        File file = new File(\"path_to_your_file.pls\");\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(file);\n\n        while (scanner.hasNextLine()) {\n            String line = scanner.nextLine();\n            if (line.startsWith(\"File\")) {\n                String url = line.substring(line.indexOf('=') + 1);\n                System.out."}
