It looks very inefficient, and I think I may be using the wrong data structure for this kind of task.Is there a more efficient way of implementing the algorithm above?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: Yes, there is a more efficient way of implementing the algorithm above. You can use a HashSet to store the IDs from the updatedIds list and then use the retainAll method to remove the obsolete records from the masterList. Here is the code:\n\n<<<api>>>: java.util.HashSet\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nHashSet<Integer> updatedIdsSet = new HashSet<>(updatedIds);\nmasterList.retainAll(updatedIdsSet);\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: In the code above, we first convert the updatedIds list to a HashSet. This is because HashSet provides constant time performance for the basic operations (add, remove and contains), which makes it more efficient for this task. Then, we use the retainAll method to keep only the records in the masterList that are also in the updatedIdsSet. This effectively removes the obsolete records from the masterList.\n\nPlease note that the masterList will be modified in-place, and the updatedIdsSet will be used to add new records to the masterList. If you want to keep the original masterList intact, you can create a copy of it before calling retainAll.\n\nThis approach is more efficient because it avoids nested loops and uses the built-in methods of the HashSet class. It also has a better time complexity, as the time complexity of the retainAll method is O(n), where n is the size of the masterList.\n\nPlease note that the Record class must implement the hashCode and equals methods to ensure that the HashSet can correctly compare the records.\n```\n\nThis approach is more efficient because it avoids nested loops and uses the built-in methods of the HashSet class.
