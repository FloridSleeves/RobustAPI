If there is no next player (i.e., we have reached the end of the Map), we reset the Iterator to start from the beginning. This effectively creates a loop around the Map.\n\n```java\npublic boolean endOfTurn(Player currentPlayerTurn) {\n    Iterator<Player> iterator = players.values().iterator();\n    while (iterator.hasNext()) {\n        if (iterator.next().equals(currentPlayerTurn)) {\n            if (iterator.hasNext()) {\n                currentPlayerTurn = iterator.next();\n            } else {\n                iterator = players.values().iterator();\n                currentPlayerTurn = iterator.next();\n            }\n            return true;\n        }\n    }\n    return false;\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: This code checks if the current player's turn is the same as the next player in the iterator. If it is, it sets the currentPlayerTurn to the next player in the iterator. If there is no next player (i.e., we have reached the end of the iterator), we reset the iterator to start from the beginning. This effectively creates a loop around the iterator.\n\n```java\npublic boolean endOfTurn(Player currentPlayerTurn) {\n    Iterator<Player> iterator = players.values().iterator();\n    while (iterator.hasNext()) {\n        Player player = iterator.next();\n        if (player.equals(currentPlayerTurn)) {\n            if (iterator.hasNext()) {\n                currentPlayerTurn = iterator.next();\n            } else {\n                iterator = players.values().iterator();\n                currentPlayerTurn = iterator.next();\n            }\n            return true;\n        }\n    }\n    return false;\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: This code does the same as the previous one, but it stores the next player in a variable before checking if it's the current player's turn. This is to avoid the issue of the iterator being advanced twice in the case where the current player is the last player in the iterator.\n\n```java\npublic boolean endOfTurn(Player currentPlayerTurn) {\n    Iterator<Player> iterator = players.values().iterator();\n    while (iterator.hasNext()) {\n        Player player = iterator.next();\n        if (player.equals(currentPlayerTurn)) {\n            if (iterator.hasNext()) {\n                currentPlayerTurn = iterator.next();\n            } else {\n                iterator = players.values().iterator();\n                currentPlayerTurn = iterator.next();\n            }\n            return true;\n        }\n    }\n    return false;\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: This code does the same as the previous one, but it stores the next player in a variable before checking if it's the current player's turn.
