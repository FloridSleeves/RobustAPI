The PEM string is converted to OpenSSH format by removing the PEM header and footer and adding the OpenSSH identifier (\"ssh-dss\"). The OpenSSH string is then written to the \"authorized_keys\" file.\nNote: This code assumes that you have Bouncy Castle provider installed in your Java environment. If you don't, you can add it by adding `securityProvider.addProvider(new BouncyCastleProvider());` before `KeyPairGenerator kpGen = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(\"DSA\", \"BC\");`.\nAlso, this code writes the OpenSSH string to the \"authorized_keys\" file. If you want to write it to a different file, you can replace `\"authorized_keys\"` with the path to your desired file.\nPlease note that this code is for demonstration purposes only and may not work in a real-world scenario. Always make sure to handle exceptions properly in your production code.\nAlso, the Bouncy Castle provider is not included in the standard Java distribution, so you need to add it manually.\n```\n\nPlease note that the Bouncy Castle provider is not included in the standard Java distribution, so you need to add it manually.\n\nAlso, the code assumes that you have Bouncy Castle provider installed in your Java environment.
