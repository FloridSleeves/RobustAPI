You can use a while loop to continuously check the connection status. If the connection is lost, the thread will wait for a certain period of time before trying to reconnect. Here is an example of how you can modify your code:\n\n```java\npublic void SendMessage(String message) {\n    while (true) {\n        try {\n            if (socket == null || socket.isClosed() || !socket.isConnected()) {\n                socket = new Socket(actuatorAddress, destPort.get());\n                outToServer = socket.getOutputStream();\n                out = new DataOutputStream(outToServer);\n            }\n            out.write(message.getBytes());\n            out.flush();\n            Thread.sleep(500); // Wait for 500 milliseconds before checking the connection again\n        } catch (IOException ex) {\n            System.out.println(ex.getMessage());\n            socket = null; // Reset the socket to null so it can be reconnected on the next iteration\n            Thread.sleep(5000); // Wait for 5 seconds before trying to reconnect\n        } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, the `SendMessage` method is a continuous loop that checks if the socket is connected. If it's not, it tries to reconnect. If the connection is lost, it waits for 500 milliseconds before trying to reconnect again. If the connection is successful, it sends the message and waits for 500 milliseconds before checking the connection again. The `InterruptedException` is caught to prevent the thread from crashing.\n\nPlease note that this code will run indefinitely until the program is stopped. If you want to stop it, you can add a condition to the while loop that checks a variable that you can set to `true` when you want to stop the thread.\n\nAlso, remember to handle the `IOException` in a way that makes sense for your application. In this example, I'm just printing the error message and resetting the socket to null so it can be reconnected on the next iteration. You might want to handle the exception differently in your application.\n\nThis code uses `DataOutputStream.write` to send the message. If you want to send a string, you can use `writeBytes` instead. The `flush` method is used to ensure that the message is sent immediately.\n\n```java\nout.writeBytes(message);\nout.flush();\n```\n\nThis code will keep trying to connect to the server until it is up and running. It will also keep trying to send the message until it is successful.\n\nPlease note that this code will run indefinitely until the program is stopped.
