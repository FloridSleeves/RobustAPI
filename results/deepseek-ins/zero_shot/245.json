The boolean array is first expanded to a boolean array of length bools.length * 8, where each boolean is represented by an 8-bit field. The function toBinary iterates over the input array and sets the corresponding bits in the output array. The function fromBinary iterates over the input array in steps of 8 and reconstructs the original boolean values.\n\nPeter's answer: <<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nbyte[] toBinary(boolean[] bools) {\n    byte[] bytes = new byte[(int) Math.ceil(bools.length / 8.0)];\n    for (int i = 0; i < bools.length; i++) {\n        if (bools[i]) {\n            bytes[i / 8] |= (1 << (i % 8));\n        }\n    }\n    return bytes;\n}\n\nboolean[] fromBinary(byte[] bytes) {\n    boolean[] bools = new boolean[bytes.length * 8];\n    for (int i = 0; i < bytes.length; i++) {\n        byte b = bytes[i];\n        for (int j = 0; j < 8; j++) {\n            bools[i * 8 + j] = ((b >> j) & 1) != 0;\n        }\n    }\n    return bools;\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: The functions toBinary and fromBinary convert between boolean arrays and their binary representation. The boolean array is first expanded to a byte array of length ceil(bools.length / 8.0), where each byte represents 8 boolean values. The function toBinary iterates over the input array and sets the corresponding bits in the output array. The function fromBinary iterates over the input array and reconstructs the original boolean values.\n\nNOTE: The functions assume that the input boolean array has a length that is a multiple of 8. If this is not the case, the functions may not work correctly.\n\nNOTE: The functions use bitwise operations to manipulate the bytes. The bitwise OR operator (|) is used to set the corresponding bit in the byte, and the bitwise AND operator (&) is used to check the value of the bit. The bitwise shift operators (<< and >>) are used to shift the bits in the byte.\n\nNOTE: The functions use the Math.ceil function to calculate the length of the byte array. This is necessary because the length of the byte array must be an integer, and the length of the boolean array may not be an integer.\n\nNOTE: The functions use the bitwise OR operator (|) to set the corresponding bit in the byte.
