The XML element \"element\" contains the value \"value (something)\" and you want to split this value into two parts: \"value\" and \"(something)\" and assign them to the fields \"one\" and \"two\" respectively.\n\nTo achieve this, you can use the `StringTokenizer` class to split the value of the XML element into two parts. Here is an example:\n\n```java\nimport javax.xml.bind.*;\nimport javax.xml.bind.annotation.*;\nimport java.util.StringTokenizer;\n\n@XmlRootElement(name = \"root\")\npublic class XmlClass {\n\n    @XmlElement(name = \"element\")\n    private String element;\n\n    public String getOne() {\n        return one;\n    }\n\n    public String getTwo() {\n        return two;\n    }\n\n    private String one;\n    private String two;\n\n    @PostConstruct\n    public void postConstruct() {\n        StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(element, \" \");\n        one = st.nextToken();\n        two = st.nextToken();\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws JAXBException {\n        JAXBContext jc = JAXBContext.newInstance(XmlClass.class);\n        Unmarshaller um = jc.createUnmarshaller();\n        StringReader reader = new StringReader(\"<root><element>value (something)</element></root>\");\n        XmlClass xmlClass = (XmlClass) um.unmarshal(reader);\n        System.out.println(xmlClass.getOne()); // prints \"value\"\n        System.out.println(xmlClass.getTwo()); // prints \"(something)\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `postConstruct` method is used to split the value of the XML element into two parts after the XML has been unmarshalled. The `StringTokenizer` class is used to split the value of the XML element by space. The first token is assigned to the field \"one\" and the second token is assigned to the field \"two\".\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the value of the XML element always contains exactly two parts separated by a space. If the value can contain more than two parts or if the value can contain a space within the parts, you will need a more complex solution to split the value into the two parts.\n\nAlso, please note that the `@PostConstruct` annotation is used to indicate that the `postConstruct` method should be called after the object has been unmarshalled from the XML. This is a JAXB specific annotation and it is not part of the Java programming language.\n\nThis solution should work for your case. If you have any further questions, please let me know.\n\nAnswer: The problem is that you are trying to unmarshal the same XML element into two different fields.
