The StringTokenizer object keeps track of the current position in the string, and when you call nextToken(), it moves the position to the next token. So, when you call hasMoreElements(), it checks if there are more tokens from the current position to the end of the string, not from the beginning to the current position.\n\nSo, you should create a new StringTokenizer object for getting the tokens and another one for checking if there are more tokens.\n\nHere is the corrected code:\n\n```java\nString str = \"123|apple|apple|apple|dog$\";\nStringTokenizer strString = new StringTokenizer(str, \"|\");\nint i = 0;\nwhile (strString.hasMoreTokens()) {\n    if (i == 0)\n        str1 = strString.nextToken();\n    else if (i == 1)\n        str2 = strString.nextToken();\n    else if (i == 2) {\n        str3 = strString.nextToken();\n        break;\n    }\n    i = i + 1;\n}\n```\n\nThis code will work as expected and will separate the string into three parts (str1, str2, str3) based on the \"|\" character.\n\nNote: I also changed hasMoreElements() to hasMoreTokens() because it is the correct method to check if there are more tokens in a StringTokenizer.\n\nAlso, I moved the increment of i inside the while loop because you want to increment i after each token is processed, not before.\n\nFinally, I removed the Loginstring. prefix from nextToken() because it seems like a typo.\n\nI hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\n```\n\nA: The problem is that you are using the same StringTokenizer object (strString) to get the tokens and also to check if there are more tokens.
