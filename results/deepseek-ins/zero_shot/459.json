The Iterator.next() method is used to get the next property name and the getProperty() method is used to get the value of the property.\nPlease note that this code is written in Java and uses the Gremlin-Java library to interact with the graph database.\n\n\nA: Cypher is a query language for the graph database Neo4j. It doesn't provide a built-in way to return all properties of a node. However, you can use the RETURN clause in Cypher to return specific properties of a node.\nHere is an example of how you can return all properties of a node:\nMATCH (n)\nRETURN n\n\nThis will return all nodes in the graph and their properties.\n\nIf you want to return only specific properties, you can specify them in the RETURN clause:\nMATCH (n)\nRETURN n.property1, n.property2, n.property3\n\nThis will return the values of properties property1, property2, and property3 for all nodes in the graph.\n\nIn your case, you want to return all properties of a node in a specific language. You can do this by using a parameter to specify the language:\nMATCH (n)\nWHERE n.language = {language}\nRETURN n\n\nIn this query, replace {language} with the language you want to use. This will return all nodes in the graph that have the specified language property.\n\nPlease note that the Gremlin-Java library doesn't provide a direct equivalent to the Cypher MATCH and RETURN clauses. You would need to use the Gremlin-Java API to execute the query and retrieve the results.\n\nA: Here is how you can do it in Gremlin-Java:\n\n```java\nGraph graph = ... // your graph\n\nString language = \"FR\"; // the language you want to use\n\nIterator<Vertex> nodes = graph.traversal().V().has('language', language).iterator();\n\nwhile (nodes.hasNext()) {\n    Vertex node = nodes.next();\n    Iterator<Map.Entry<String, Object>> properties = node.propertyMap().iterator();\n\n    while (properties.hasNext()) {\n        Map.Entry<String, Object> property = properties.next();\n        System.out.println(property.getKey() + \" : \" + property.getValue());\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code will iterate over all nodes with the 'language' property set to 'FR', and for each node, it will print all its properties and their values.\n\nPlease note that the Gremlin-Java library doesn't provide a direct equivalent to the Cypher MATCH and RETURN clauses. You would need to use the Gremlin-Java API to execute the query and retrieve the results.\n\nThis code is written in Java and uses the Gremlin-Java library to interact with the graph database.\n\nPlease replace `...` with your actual graph.\n\nAlso, replace `\"FR\"` with the language you want to use.\n\nThis code will print the name and value of each property for each node that has the specified language.\n\nPlease note that the Gremlin-Java library doesn't provide a direct equivalent to the Cypher MATCH and RETURN clauses.
