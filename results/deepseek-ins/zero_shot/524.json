Then, in your entity class A, you can use a method to limit the size of the collection.\n\n<<<code>>>:\n\n```java\n@Entity\npublic class A {\n    // fields\n    @OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true)\n    @OrderBy(\"id ASC\")\n    private List<B> b = new ArrayList<>();\n\n    public void addB(B b) {\n        if (this.b.size() >= 5) {\n            this.b.remove(0);\n        }\n        this.b.add(b);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, the addB method checks if the size of the list 'b' is greater than or equal to 5. If it is, it removes the oldest entry (the one at index 0). Then it adds the new entry to the end of the list.\n\nThis way, you ensure that the size of the list 'b' never exceeds 5, and the oldest entry is removed when a new one is added.\n\nPlease note that you need to call addB method instead of directly adding to the list 'b' to ensure the size limit is maintained.\n\nThis solution is clean and does not require a separate job to remove the older entries.\n\n```\n\n<<<explanation>>>:\n\nThis solution uses JPA's @OneToMany annotation to map the relationship between entities A and B. The cascade type ALL ensures that all operations on the B entities (add, remove, etc.) are also cascaded to the B entities. The orphanRemoval = true option enables Hibernate to remove B entities that are no longer referenced by A.\n\nThe addB method is used to add a new B entity to the list 'b'. It first checks if the size of the list is greater than or equal to 5. If it is, it removes the oldest B entity (the one at index 0). Then it adds the new B entity to the end of the list.\n\nThis way, the size of the list 'b' is always maintained at 5, and the oldest B entity is removed when a new one is added. This ensures that there are never more than 5 B entities in the list.\n\nPlease note that you need to call addB method instead of directly adding to the list 'b' to ensure the size limit is maintained.\n\nThis solution is clean and does not require a separate job to remove the older entries.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
