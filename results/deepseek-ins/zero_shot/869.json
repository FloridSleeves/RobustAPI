It looks like this: What I tried: FileInputStream is; FileOutputStream out; File input = new File(filePath); int fileLength = input.length(); int len = 0;    while (len < fileLength){        len += is.read(buff);        // write my data        out.write(data, 0, data.length);       // how to move is to read next 10kb???    }I wonder is there anyway to move the cursor reader to next amount of bytes? Or do I miss anything?Update:Thank to @DThought, here is my implementation:    File input = new File(filePath);    long fileLength = input.length();    byte[] data;    byte[] buff = new byte[data.length];    long JUMP_LENGTH = 10 * 1024;    RandomAccessFile raf = new RandomAccessFile(input, \"rw\");    long step = JUMP_LENGTH + data.length;    for (long i = 0; i < fileLength; i += step) {        // read to buffer        raf.seek(i);        raf.read(buff);        raf.seek(i); // make sure it move to correct place after reading        raf.write(data);    }    raf.close();And it worked well.\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Update data to file each amount of bytes: :I want to write my content data to a file each 10kb of file.

The \"rw\" parameter indicates that you want to both read and write data. The seek(pos) method sets the file pointer to the specified position, and the write(data) method writes the specified bytes to the file.\nPlease note that RandomAccessFile is not thread-safe. If you need to share a RandomAccessFile across multiple threads, you should use the RandomAccessFile.getChannel() method to obtain a FileChannel, and then use that to create a FileLock.\nAlso, remember to close the RandomAccessFile after you're done with it to free up system resources.\n<<<code>>>: raf.close();\nThank you for your help.\n\nA: You can use RandomAccessFile for this purpose. Here's an example:\nRandomAccessFile raf = new RandomAccessFile(file, \"rw\");\nlong fileLength = raf.length();\nbyte[] data; // your data to write\nbyte[] buff = new byte[10 * 1024]; // buffer for reading\nlong JUMP_LENGTH = 10 * 1024; // how many bytes to jump\n\nfor (long i = 0; i < fileLength; i += JUMP_LENGTH) {\n    raf.seek(i);\n    raf.read(buff);\n    raf.seek(i); // make sure it moves to correct place after reading\n    raf.write(data);\n}\n\nraf.close();\n\nThis code will read and write data to the file in chunks of 10KB. The data to write is stored in the byte array 'data'. The 'JUMP_LENGTH' variable determines how many bytes to jump to the next chunk.\nPlease note that RandomAccessFile is not thread-safe.
