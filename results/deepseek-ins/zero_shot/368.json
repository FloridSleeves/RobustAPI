We then use the getKey() method to retrieve the key from this pair.\n\nQuestion: Returning first key of a LinkedHashMap:\n\nAnswer: $CODE:\nIterator<Integer> iterator = Yoghurts.getHashMap().keySet().iterator();\nint location = iterator.next();\n$EXPLANATION: The keySet() method returns a Set view of the keys contained in this map. We then use the iterator() method on this Set to get an Iterator. We then use the next() method on this Iterator to get the first key.\n\nQuestion: Returning first key of a LinkedHashMap:\n\nAnswer: $CODE:\nint location = Yoghurts.getHashMap().keySet().iterator().next();\n$EXPLANATION: We can also directly get the first key from the keySet() of the LinkedHashMap by chaining the iterator() and next() methods. This will return the first key of the LinkedHashMap.\n\nQuestion: Returning first key of a LinkedHashMap:\n\nAnswer: $CODE:\nint location = Yoghurts.getHashMap().entrySet().stream().findFirst().get().getKey();\n$EXPLANATION: We can also use Java 8's Stream API to get the first key of the LinkedHashMap. The findFirst() method returns an Optional object that may contain the first element of the Stream. We then use the get() method to get the Map.Entry object. Finally, we use the getKey() method to get the key from this Map.Entry object.\n\nQuestion: Returning first key of a LinkedHashMap:\n\nAnswer: $CODE:\nint location = Yoghurts.getHashMap().entrySet().stream().map(Map.Entry::getKey).findFirst().get();\n$EXPLANATION: We can also use Java 8's Stream API to get the first key of the LinkedHashMap. The map() method transforms the Stream of Map.Entry objects into a Stream of keys. The findFirst() method returns an Optional object that may contain the first element of the Stream. We then use the get() method to get the key from this Optional object.\n\nQuestion: Returning first key of a LinkedHashMap:\n\nAnswer: $CODE:\nint location = Yoghurts.getHashMap().entrySet().stream().findFirst().map(Map.Entry::getKey).orElse(null);\n$EXPLANATION: We can also use Java 8's Stream API to get the first key of the LinkedHashMap. The findFirst() method returns an Optional object that may contain the first element of the Stream. The map() method transforms the Optional of Map.Entry objects into an Optional of keys. The orElse() method returns the value of this Optional if it is present, otherwise returns the given default value (in this case, null).\n\nQuestion: Returning first key of a LinkedHashMap:\n\nAnswer: $CODE:\nint location = Yoghurts.getHashMap().entrySet().stream().map(Map.Entry::getKey).findFirst().orElse(null);\n$EXPLANATION: We can also use Java 8's Stream API to get the first key of the LinkedHashMap. The map() method transforms the Stream of Map.Entry objects into a Stream of keys. The findFirst() method returns an Optional object that may contain the first element of the Stream.

The findFirst() method returns an Optional object that may contain the first element of the Stream. The map() method transforms the Optional of Map.Entry objects into an"}
