The read method is used to read bytes from the input stream, and the write method is used to write bytes to the output stream. The read method returns the number of bytes read, and the write method writes the specified number of bytes to the output stream. The read method is called in a loop until the end of the input stream is reached or the given length is reached. The skip method is used to skip the given number of bytes from the input stream.\n\nNote: This function assumes that the input stream supports the skip method and the length parameter is in bytes. If the input stream does not support the skip method, you will need to read the bytes from the input stream until the start position is reached, and then call the read method in a loop.\n\nAlso, this function does not close the input stream or the output stream. You should close them after you are done with them.\n\nThis function uses a buffer to read and write bytes from and to the input and output streams. The buffer size is 1024 bytes. You can change the buffer size to improve performance.\n\nThis function may throw an IOException if an error occurs while reading from the input stream or writing to the output stream. You should handle this exception appropriately in your code.\n\nThis function does not handle the case where the length parameter is larger than the number of bytes remaining in the input stream. You should handle this case in your code.\n\nThis function does not handle the case where the input stream is not seekable. If the input stream is not seekable, you will need to read the bytes from the input stream until the start position is reached, and then call the read method in a loop.\n\nThis function does not handle the case where the output stream is not writable. If the output stream is not writable, you will need to handle this case in your code.\n\nThis function does not handle the case where the input stream is closed before the function is called. You should handle this case in your code.\n\nThis function does not handle the case where the output stream is closed before the function is called. You should handle this case in your code.\n\nThis function does not handle the case where the input stream is not readable.
