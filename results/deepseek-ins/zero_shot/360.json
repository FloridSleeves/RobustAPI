The type of the Object is determined by the type of the collection that the iterator was created from. In this case, the iterator was created from a HashMap, which means that the next() method will return Map.Entry objects. If you try to assign the result of i.next() directly to a Map.Entry variable without casting, the compiler will throw a ClassCastException at runtime.\n\n\nA: The reason you need to cast the result of i.next() to Map.Entry is because the next() method of an Iterator returns an Object.
