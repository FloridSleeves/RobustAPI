However, the two first lines of this data file both contain a String. How come a token would not be read for the second line?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: The issue is that the StringTokenizer is trying to read from the file until it finds a space, but the second line of your file \"WERTYU\" does not have a space to separate it from the first line. As a result, the StringTokenizer is trying to read from the file until it finds a space, but there are none, hence the NoSuchElementException.\n\nTo fix this, you should use f.readLine() twice to read two lines from the file. Here is the corrected code:\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.*;\nclass dothis {\n  public static void main (String [] args) throws IOException {\n    BufferedReader f = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"ride.in\"));\n    PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(\"ride.out\")));\n    StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(f.readLine());\n    String s1 = st.nextToken();\n    String s2 = f.readLine();\n    char[] arr = new char[6];\n    if (find(s1, arr, 1) == find(s2, arr, 1)) {\n      out.print(\"one\");\n    } else {\n      out.println(\"two\");\n    }\n    out.close();\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis should solve the problem.\n\nNote: The find() method is not defined in your code, so you will need to define it or replace it with the appropriate logic.\n\nAlso, remember to handle the IOException that may occur when reading from the file.\n\nThis code will read the first line of the file and split it into two tokens using a StringTokenizer. It will then read the second line of the file directly.\n\nThis should solve the problem.\n\nNote: The find() method is not defined in your code, so you will need to define it or replace it with the appropriate logic.\n\nAlso, remember to handle the IOException that may occur when reading from the file.\n\nThis code will read the first line of the file and split it into two tokens using a StringTokenizer.
