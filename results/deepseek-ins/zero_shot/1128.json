The first token is the name and the second token is the url.\n\nA: The servlet reads the array from the client-side JavaScript code by using the getParameterValues method. The array is received as a single string, which is then tokenized using the StringTokenizer class. The first token is the name and the second token is the url.\n\nHere is the code:\nStringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(data[0], \",\");\nString name = st.nextToken();\nString url = st.nextToken();\n\nIn this code, the StringTokenizer is used to split the string into tokens. The string is split at each comma. The first token is the name and the second token is the url.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the array is sent as a single string with the format \"name,url\". If the array is sent as a different format, you will need to adjust the code accordingly.\n\nAlso, please note that this code does not handle any potential errors that may occur when trying to get the next token from the StringTokenizer. You should add appropriate error handling code to handle these potential exceptions.\n\nFinally, please note that this code is written in Java. If you are using a different server-side language, the code will need to be adjusted accordingly.\n\nI hope this helps, and let me know if you have any other questions.\n\nAnswer: $CODE:\nStringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(data[0], \",\");\nString name = st.nextToken();\nString url = st.nextToken();\n$EXPLANATION:\nThe servlet reads the array from the client-side JavaScript code by using the getParameterValues method.
