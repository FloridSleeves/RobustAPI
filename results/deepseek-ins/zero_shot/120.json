This can cause a buffer overflow and result in data loss.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can use a separate thread to handle the file sending and receiving. The server can send the file to the client and simultaneously, the client can read the file from the server.\n\nHere is an example of how you can modify your code:\n\nServer-thread:\n```java\nnew Thread(() -> {\n    try {\n        DataOutputStream out = new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());\n        FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(fn);\n        byte[] buffer = new byte[fis.available()];\n        fis.read(buffer);\n        out.writeInt(buffer.length); // Send the file size first\n        out.write(buffer); // Then send the file content\n        out.flush();\n    } catch (Exception c) {\n        System.err.println(\"exc\" + c);\n    }\n}).start();\n```\n\nClient-thread:\n```java\nnew Thread(() -> {\n    try {\n        DataInputStream in = new DataInputStream(socket.getInputStream());\n        int length = in.readInt(); // First read the file size\n        byte[] buffer = new byte[length];\n        in.readFully(buffer); // Then read the file content\n        String pic = \"copy\" + studId + \".pdf\";\n        System.out.println(pic);\n        FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(pic);\n        fos.write(buffer);\n        fos.flush();\n        fos.close();\n    } catch (Exception e) {\n        System.out.println(\"Exception writing\");\n    }\n}).start();\n```\n\nIn this modified code, the server sends the file size first using `DataOutputStream.writeInt()`, and then sends the file content using `DataOutputStream.write()`. The client reads the file size first using `DataInputStream.readInt()`, and then reads the file content using `DataInputStream.readFully()`. This ensures that the client always has all the data it needs to read the file.\n\nAlso, make sure to handle exceptions properly in your code. The current code does not handle exceptions properly and may cause your program to crash.\n\nI hope this helps.
