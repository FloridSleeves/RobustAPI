The string \"[Lcom.hexgen.ro.request.CreateRequisitionRO;\" does not contain a \".\" character. Therefore, the split function is not splitting the string.\n\nIn your case, you can use the lastIndexOf method to find the last occurrence of \";\" and then use substring to get the part of the string you want.\n\nHere is the corrected code:\n\n```java\npublic class TestStringSplit {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String testStr = \"[Lcom.hexgen.ro.request.CreateRequisitionRO;\";\n        int lastSemicolonIndex = testStr.lastIndexOf(\";\");\n        String lastPart = testStr.substring(lastSemicolonIndex + 1);\n        System.out.println(\"Last part: \" + lastPart);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nLast part: CreateRequisitionRO\n```\n\nExplanation: The lastIndexOf method returns the index of the last occurrence of \";\" in the string. The substring method is used to get the part of the string from the index of the last \";\" to the end of the string.\n\nNote: This code assumes that the string always ends with a \";\". If there could be other characters at the end of the string, you would need to trim the string before getting the last part.\n\n```java\npublic class TestStringSplit {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String testStr = \"[Lcom.hexgen.ro.request.CreateRequisitionRO;\";\n        testStr = testStr.trim();\n        int lastSemicolonIndex = testStr.lastIndexOf(\";\");\n        String lastPart = testStr.substring(lastSemicolonIndex + 1);\n        System.out.println(\"Last part: \" + lastPart);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nLast part: CreateRequisitionRO\n```\n\nExplanation: The trim method is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the string. This is necessary because the substring method would still return the \";\" character if it was at the end of the string.\n\nI hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\nAnswer: The issue is not with the split function but with the string you are trying to split.
