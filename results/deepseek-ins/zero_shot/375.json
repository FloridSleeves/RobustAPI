In this case, we are converting an Iterator over the keys of the HashMap to an Enumeration. This is a simple and efficient way to convert between the two.\n\nNote: This method is deprecated since Java 9. In Java 9 and later, you should use the Iterator.next method directly.\n\nCode:\n```java\nHashMap<String, String> map = new HashMap<>();\nmap.put(\"key1\", \"value1\");\nmap.put(\"key2\", \"value2\");\nmap.put(\"key3\", \"value3\");\n\nIterator<String> iterator = map.keySet().iterator();\nEnumeration<String> enumeration = Collections.enumeration(iterator);\n\nwhile (enumeration.hasMoreElements()) {\n    String key = enumeration.nextElement();\n    System.out.println(key);\n}\n```\nThis code will print out the keys of the HashMap: key1, key2, key3.\n\nPlease note that this method is deprecated since Java 9.
