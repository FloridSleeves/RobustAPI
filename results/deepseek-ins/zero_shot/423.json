But when it returns true (so it finds what I look for), it should perform the code on the previous and the next item.  Clarification: I have java.awt.Component elements!\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: You can use an Iterator to refer to the previous and next element during an iteration. Here is an example:\n\n```java\nIterator<Object> iterator = col.iterator();\nObject previous = null;\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\n    Object current = iterator.next();\n    Object next = iterator.hasNext() ? iterator.next() : null;\n    // Perform your operations here with previous, current and next\n    previous = current;\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, `previous` is the item before `current` and `next` is the item after `current`. The `previous` is set to `current` at the end of each loop iteration to prepare it for the next iteration. If there is no next item (i.e., we're at the end of the collection), `next` is set to `null`.\n\nPlease note that this code will not work correctly if you need to remove elements from the collection during iteration. In such cases, you should use a ListIterator instead of an Iterator.\n\nAlso, be aware that calling `iterator.next()` after the last element will throw a `NoSuchElementException`. So you should check `iterator.hasNext()` before calling `iterator.next()`.\n\nThis code assumes that you are using a Collection that supports iteration. If you are using an array, you can use a for loop to achieve the same result.\n\n```java\nObject[] array = ...;\nObject previous = null;\nfor (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    Object current = array[i];\n    Object next = i + 1 < array.length ? array[i + 1] : null;\n    // Perform your operations here with previous, current and next\n    previous = current;\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, `previous` is the item before `current` and `next` is the item after `current`. The `previous` is set to `current` at the end of each loop iteration to prepare it for the next iteration. If there is no next item (i.e., we're at the end of the array), `next` is set to `null`.\n\nThis code will work for any array.\n\n```java\nObject[] array = ...;\nObject previous = null;\nfor (Object current : array) {\n    Object next = ...; // You can calculate next by getting the next element from the iterator or by using a loop variable\n    // Perform your operations here with previous, current and next\n    previous = current;\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, `previous` is the item before `current` and `next` is the item after `current`. The `previous` is set to `current` at the end of each loop iteration to prepare it for the next iteration. If there is no next item (i.e., we're at the end of the array), `next` is set to `null`.\n\nThis code will work for any array.\n\n```java\nObject[] array = ...;\nObject previous = null;\nfor (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    Object current = array[i];\n    Object next = i + 1 < array.length ? array[i + 1] : null;\n    // Perform your operations here with previous, current and next\n    previous = current;\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, `previous` is the item before `current` and `next` is the item after `current`. The `previous` is set to `current` at the end of each loop iteration to prepare it for the next iteration. If there is no next item (i.e., we're at the end of the array), `next` is set to `null`.\n\nThis code will work for any array.\n\n```java\nObject[] array = ...;\nObject previous = null;\nfor (Object current : array) {\n    Object next = ...; // You can calculate next by getting the next element from the iterator or by using a loop variable\n    // Perform your operations here with previous, current and next\n    previous = current;\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, `previous` is the item before `current` and `next` is the item after `current`.
