In your case, you are using it to get the coefficients of the polynomial from the ArrayList.\n\nQuestion: How to declare a variable that has no value?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: double x = 0.0;\n<<<code>>>: double x = 0.0;\n<<<explanation>>>: This code declares a double variable 'x' and initializes it with the value 0.0. The 'double' keyword is used to declare a variable that can hold a decimal number.\n\nQuestion: How to write a method that returns 'x' to the power of something?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Math.pow(x, y);\n<<<code>>>: Math.pow(x, i);\n<<<explanation>>>: This API is used to calculate the power of a number. In your case, you are using it to calculate the power of 'x' to the 'i'th power. The result is then returned by the method.\n\nQuestion: How to declare a variable that has no value but can be initialized later?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: double x;\n<<<code>>>: double x;\n<<<explanation>>>: This code declares a double variable 'x'. The 'double' keyword is used to declare a variable that can hold a decimal number. The variable 'x' can be initialized later with the 'x = someValue;' statement.\n\nQuestion: How to calculate the power of a number?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Math.pow(x, y);\n<<<code>>>: Math.pow(x, i);\n<<<explanation>>>: This API is used to calculate the power of a number. In your case, you are using it to calculate the power of 'x' to the 'i'th power. The result is then returned by the method.\n\nQuestion: How to calculate the root of a number?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Math.sqrt(x);\n<<<code>>>: Math.sqrt(x);\n<<<explanation>>>: This API is used to calculate the square root of a number. In your case, you are using it to calculate the square root of 'x'. The result is then returned by the method.\n\nQuestion: How to round off a number to 3 decimal places?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: String.format(\"%.3f\", x);\n<<<code>>>: String.format(\"%.3f\", x);\n<<<explanation>>>: This API is used to format a number to a specific number of decimal places. In your case, you are using it to format 'x' to 3 decimal places. The result is then returned by the method.\n\nQuestion: How to find a root in a specific interval?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: This is a complex task and usually requires numerical methods like the bisection method, Newton-Raphson method, etc. It's not a simple task to implement in a single method. You would need to implement a recursive function to find the root.\n\nPlease note that the above answers are based on the assumption that you are using Java as your programming language. The syntax and methods may vary slightly depending on the programming language you are using.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>"}
