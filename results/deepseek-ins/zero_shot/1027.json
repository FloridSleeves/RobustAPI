Thanks in advance.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: StringTokenizer\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nString str = \"tajmahal.txt sarjan.pdf noorjahan.exe\";\nStringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(str);\nString[] ar = new String[st.countTokens()];\nint i = 0;\nwhile (st.hasMoreTokens()) {\n    ar[i] = st.nextToken();\n    i++;\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: We first create a StringTokenizer object with the input string. The countTokens() function returns the number of tokens in the string. We then create a new String array of the same size. We use a while loop to iterate over the tokens and store them in the array.\n```\n\nQuestion: How to convert a string to an integer in java without using any build functions in java (because I am using j2me which does not support many j2se functions). Any help would be great. Thanks in advance.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Custom Parsing\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\npublic int convertStringToInt(String str) {\n    int result = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++) {\n        char c = str.charAt(i);\n        if (c >= '0' && c <= '9') {\n            result = result * 10 + (c - '0');\n        }\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: This function iterates over each character in the string. If the character is a digit (between '0' and '9'), it is converted to an integer and added to the current result. The result is multiplied by 10 for each new digit to shift the previous digits one place to the left.\n```\n\nQuestion: How to convert a string to an integer in java without using any build functions in java (because I am using j2me which does not support many j2se functions).
