We create a new Comparator that compares the keys of the Entry objects. The getKey method is used to access the key of an Entry object. The compareTo method is used to compare the keys. The minimum Entry is returned by the min method.\n\n\nA: You can use the following code to find the minimum and maximum in a ArrayList<Entry> using Java:\nEntry min = Collections.min(test, new Comparator<Entry>() {\n    public int compare(Entry e1, Entry e2) {\n        return e1.getKey().compareTo(e2.getKey());\n    }\n});\n\nEntry max = Collections.max(test, new Comparator<Entry>() {\n    public int compare(Entry e1, Entry e2) {\n        return e1.getKey().compareTo(e2.getKey());\n    }\n});\n\nHere, Collections.min and Collections.max are used to find the minimum and maximum elements in the ArrayList respectively. A Comparator is used to compare the keys of the Entry objects. The getKey method is used to access the key of an Entry object. The compareTo method is used to compare the keys.\n\nA: You can use Java 8 streams to find the minimum and maximum in a ArrayList<Entry>. Here is an example:\nEntry min = test.stream().min(Comparator.comparing(Entry::getKey)).orElse(null);\nEntry max = test.stream().max(Comparator.comparing(Entry::getKey)).orElse(null);\n\nIn this code, the stream() method is used to convert the ArrayList to a Stream. The min and max methods are used to find the minimum and maximum elements in the Stream respectively. The Comparator.comparing method is used to specify the key to compare the Entry objects. The getKey method is used to access the key of an Entry object. The orElse method is used to return a default value if the Stream is empty.\n\nA: You can use Java 8 streams to find the minimum and maximum in a ArrayList<Entry>. Here is an example:\nEntry min = test.stream().min(Comparator.comparing(Entry::getKey)).orElse(null);\nEntry max = test.stream().max(Comparator.comparing(Entry::getKey)).orElse(null);\n\nIn this code, the stream() method is used to convert the ArrayList to a Stream.
