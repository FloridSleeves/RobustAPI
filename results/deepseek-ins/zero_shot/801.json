This will allow you to check if an ID is in the set in constant time.\n\n*Instead of reading the second file line by line, read it all at once and store the IDs in the set.\n\n*Then, for each line in the first file, check if it is in the set.\n\n\nHere is the modified code:\npublic void getMBD() throws Exception {\n    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"C://DIDs.txt\"));\n    OutputStream os = new FileOutputStream(\"C://MBD.txt\");\n    PrintWriter pr = new PrintWriter(os);\n    String thisLine;\n    int count = 1;\n\n    // Read the second file and store the IDs in a set\n    Set<Long> ids = new HashSet<>();\n    while ((thisLine = br.readLine()) != null) {\n        ids.add(Long.parseLong(thisLine));\n    }\n\n    // Read the first file and check if each line is in the set\n    br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"C://AllIDs.txt\"));\n    while ((thisLine = br.readLine()) != null) {\n        long bid = Long.parseLong(thisLine);\n        if (!ids.contains(bid)) {\n            pr.println(thisLine);\n        }\n        System.out.println(count);\n        count++;\n    }\n\n    pr.close();\n}\n\nThis approach should significantly reduce the time taken to process large files.\n\nA: You can use a HashSet to store the IDs from the second file, and then check if each line from the first file is in the HashSet.
