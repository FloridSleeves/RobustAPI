It is a subclass of the OutputStream class.\n\n```java\nString data = \"This is the data in the output file\";\nfop.write(data.getBytes());\nfop.flush();\nfop.close();\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: Here, we are converting the string data into bytes using the getBytes() method and writing it to the file using the write() method. The flush() method is used to push all the buffered output bytes that have been written to the output stream. Finally, we close the FileOutputStream to release the resources.\n\n```java\nFileOutputStream fop = new FileOutputStream(\"file.txt\");\nString data = \"This is the data in the output file\";\nfop.write(data.getBytes());\nfop.flush();\nfop.close();\n```\nThis code will create a file named \"file.txt\" in the same directory where your java file is located and write the string \"This is the data in the output file\" to it.\n```\n\nQuestion: How do I read from a file in Java?:\nAnswer:\n<<<api>>>: FileInputStream\n<<<code>>>:\n```java\nFileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(\"file.txt\");\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: FileInputStream is a class in java.io package which is used to read data from a file. It is a subclass of the InputStream class.\n\n```java\nbyte[] data = new byte[100];\nfis.read(data);\nfis.close();\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: Here, we are creating a byte array of size 100 and reading the data from the file into this array using the read() method. The close() method is used to close the FileInputStream.\n\n```java\nFileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(\"file.txt\");\nbyte[] data = new byte[100];\nfis.read(data);\nfis.close();\n```\nThis code will read the content of the \"file.txt\" file and store it in the byte array \"data\".\n```\n\nQuestion: How do I append to a file in Java?:\nAnswer:\n<<<api>>>: FileOutputStream\n<<<code>>>:\n```java\nFileOutputStream fop = new FileOutputStream(\"file.txt\", true);\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: FileOutputStream is a class in java.io package which is used to write data into a file. It is a subclass of the OutputStream class. The second parameter of the constructor is a boolean that determines whether to append data to the file or not. If it is set to true, data will be appended to the file. If it is set to false, data will overwrite the existing data in the file.\n\n```java\nString data = \"This is the data to be appended\";\nfop.write(data.getBytes());\nfop.flush();\nfop.close();\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: Here, we are converting the string data into bytes using the getBytes() method and writing it to the file using the write() method.

BufferedReader is a class in java.io package which is used to read data from a character-input stream, buffering characters so as to"}
