In this case, it is used to give the server time to respond before attempting to read the InputStream. However, this is not a good practice as it can cause your application to become unresponsive if the server is slow to respond. Instead, we use the HttpURLConnection.getResponseCode() method to check if the server has responded with an HTTP_OK status code (200). If it has, we then proceed to read the InputStream.\n\nNote: HttpURLConnection.connect() method is used to establish a connection to the URL. This method is called before getInputStream() is called.\n\nAlso, remember to handle exceptions properly in your code. This is just a basic example and does not include error handling.\n\nThis approach should make your application more responsive and reliable.\n\nAlso, please note that this code assumes that the server will respond with an HTTP_OK status code. If the server responds with a different status code, you may need to handle that case as well.\n\nLastly, remember to close the InputStream and URLConnection after you have finished with them to free up system resources.\n\nThis approach should make your application more efficient and reliable.\n\nAlso, please note that this code assumes that the server will respond with an HTTP_OK status code. If the server responds with a different status code, you may need to handle that case as well.\n\nLastly, remember to close the InputStream and URLConnection after you have finished with them to free up system resources.\n\nThis approach should make your application more efficient and reliable.\n\nAlso, please note that this code assumes that the server will respond with an HTTP_OK status code.
