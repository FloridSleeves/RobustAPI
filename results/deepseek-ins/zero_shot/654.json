I also would like a pure Java approach the works on Linux, Mac OS and Windows.Requirements:When the user presses some key I want to know what key is that;When the user releases some key, I want to know what key is that;I want to ignore the system auto repeat options: I want to receive just one keypress event for each key press and just one key release event for each key release;If possible, I would use items 1 to 3 to know if the user is holding more than one key at a time (i.e, she hits 'a' and without releasing it, she hits \"Enter\").The problem I'm facing in Java is that under Linux, when the user holds some key, there are many keyPress and keyRelease events being fired (because of the keyboard repeat feature).I've tried some approaches with no success:Get the last time a key event occurred - in Linux, they seem to be zero for key repeat, however, in Mac OS they are not;Consider an event only if the current keyCode is different from the last one - this way the user can't hit twice the same key in a row;Here is the basic (non working) part of code:import java.awt.event.KeyListener;public class Example implements KeyListener {public void keyTyped(KeyEvent e) {}public void keyPressed(KeyEvent e) {    System.out.println(\"KeyPressed: \"+e.getKeyCode()+\", ts=\"+e.getWhen());}public void keyReleased(KeyEvent e) {    System.out.println(\"KeyReleased: \"+e.getKeyCode()+\", ts=\"+e.getWhen());}}When a user holds a key (i.e, 'p') the system shows:KeyPressed:  80, ts=1253637271673KeyReleased: 80, ts=1253637271923KeyPressed:  80, ts=1253637271923KeyReleased: 80, ts=1253637271956KeyPressed:  80, ts=1253637271956KeyReleased: 80, ts=1253637271990KeyPressed:  80, ts=1253637271990KeyReleased: 80, ts=1253637272023KeyPressed:  80, ts=1253637272023...At least under Linux, the JVM keeps resending all the key events when a key is being hold. To make things more difficult, on my system (Kubuntu 9.04 Core 2 Duo) the timestamps keep changing. The JVM sends a key new release and new key press with the same timestamp. This makes it hard to know when a key is really released.Any ideas?Thanks\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How to know when a user has really released a key in Java?: :(Edited for clarity)I want to detect when a user presses and releases a key in Java Swing, ignoring the keyboard auto repeat feature.

In this case, we use it to add a KeyListener to the entire screen. We store the time of each key press in a map, and when a key is released, we check if we have a corresponding key press in the map. If we do, we calculate the duration of the key press and remove it from the map. This way, we can ignore key events that are not paired with a key press, and we can also ignore key events that are fired multiple times in quick succession.\n\nNote: The java.awt.Robot class is not part of the standard Java API, and it may not work on all platforms. It is available on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows, but it may not work on all versions of these platforms.\n\nAlso, the use of the java.awt.Robot class can be considered as a hack, and it may not be the best solution for your problem. It's better to use the standard Java API to handle keyboard events, as described in your question.\n\nI hope this helps.
