It starts by getting the first element and storing it in the variable 'last'. Then it goes through the rest of the ArrayList, comparing each element to 'last'. If it finds a duplicate, it removes the current element using the iterator's remove method. If it doesn't find a duplicate, it updates 'last' to the current element and continues. This way, it only removes duplicates that are next to each other, not all duplicates.\n\n\nA: You can use a LinkedList instead of an ArrayList. The LinkedList class in Java provides a method called removeNext() which removes the next element in the list.\nHere is a sample code:\nLinkedList<Integer> linkedList = new LinkedList<Integer>(original);\nfor (int i = 0; i < linkedList.size() - 1; i++) {\n    if (linkedList.get(i).equals(linkedList.get(i + 1))) {\n        linkedList.remove(i + 1);\n        i--; // decrement i to check the same element again\n    }\n}\noriginal = new ArrayList<Integer>(linkedList);\n\nThis code will remove all the duplicates in the original list.\n\nA: You can use a simple for loop and a temporary variable to store the last element you've seen. If the current element is the same as the last one, you can remove it.\nHere is the code:\nint last = original.get(0);\nfor (int i = 1; i < original.size(); i++) {\n    if (original.get(i) == last) {\n        original.remove(i);\n        i--; // decrement i to check the same element again\n    } else {\n        last = original.get(i);\n    }\n}\n\nThis code will remove all the duplicates in the original list.\n\nA: You can use a ListIterator to remove elements from the list while iterating over it. Here is an example:\nListIterator<Integer> iterator = original.listIterator();\n\nint last = iterator.next();\nwhile(iterator.hasNext()){\n    int current = iterator.next();\n    if(last == current){\n        iterator.remove();\n    } else {\n        last = current;\n    }\n}\n\nThis code will remove all the duplicates in the original list.\n\nA: You can use Java 8 Streams to remove duplicates from an ArrayList. Here is an example:\nList<Integer> original = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7));\nList<Integer> result = original.stream().distinct().collect(Collectors.toList());\n\nIn this code, the distinct() method is used to remove duplicates from the stream. The collect() method is used to convert the stream back into a List.\n\nA: Here is a simple way to remove duplicates from an ArrayList in Java:\n\n```java\nArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<Integer>(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7));\n\nArrayList<Integer> newList = new ArrayList<Integer>();\n\nfor (Integer integer : list) {\n    if (!newList.contains(integer)) {\n        newList.add(integer);\n    }\n}\n\nSystem.out.println(\"ArrayList with duplicates removed: \" + newList);\n```\n\nIn this code, we create a new ArrayList and add elements to it only if they are not already present in the ArrayList. This way, we effectively remove duplicates.\n\nPlease note that this method has a time complexity of O(n^2), which means it can be slow for large lists. If you need to remove duplicates from a large list, consider using a different data structure or algorithm.\n\nA: You can use Java 8"}
