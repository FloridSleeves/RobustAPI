Chunks #3 and #14 fail (maybe the cellular/WiFi connection was bad).  I can now re-upload just these two chunks and everything will be good.What I'd like to know is how can I read only part of a file (like the data between 3MB and 4MB)?

It can be used to read a segment of a file. In this case, we are using the seek() method to skip the first 3MB of the file and then read the next 1MB. The read() method is used to read the data from the file into a buffer. The buffer is processed in the while loop. The loop continues until the end of the file is reached or until 1024 bytes have been read. The file is then closed.\nThis approach is efficient because it allows the file to be read from any position, not just from the beginning. It also allows for partial reads, which is useful in this case where we only want to read a segment of the file.\nPlease note that RandomAccessFile is not available on Android, but it is available on all Java platforms. If you are developing for Android, you might want to consider using FileInputStream.skip() in combination with FileInputStream.read().\nMakoto\n\nA: You can use FileInputStream's skip() method to skip the first 3MB of the file, and then read the next 1MB. Here's an example:\nFileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(file);\nfis.skip(3 * 1024 * 1024); // skip first 3MB\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\nint bytesRead;\nwhile ((bytesRead = fis.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n    // process buffer\n}\nfis.close();\n\nThis code creates a FileInputStream for the file, skips the first 3MB of the file, and then reads the next 1MB into a buffer. The buffer is processed in the while loop. The loop continues until the end of the file is reached. The file is then closed.\nPlease note that the skip() method throws an IOException if the file cannot be seeked. You should handle this exception appropriately in your code.\nAlso, be aware that the skip() method does not work on all types of InputStreams. For example, it does not work with InputStreams that are backed by a file, such as FileInputStream. If you are using such an InputStream, you might need to use a different approach, such as RandomAccessFile or a custom InputStream that supports seeking.\n\nA: You can use FileInputStream's skip() method to skip the first 3MB of the file, and then read the next 1MB.
