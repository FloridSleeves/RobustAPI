In this case, we are writing the prime number to the file.\n\n\nA: You need to use the PrintWriter's write method to write to the file. The write method takes a string as a parameter.\nwriter.write(n + \" \");\n\nThis will write the value of n followed by a space to the file.\nAlso, you should close the PrintWriter after you're done writing to the file. You can do this with the close method:\nwriter.close();\n\nThis will ensure that all data is written to the file and that the file is properly closed.\nHere's how your updated code should look:\nPrintWriter writer = null;\ntry {\n    writer = new PrintWriter(\"VectorDump\", \"UTF-8\");\n    for (int n = 2; n < 92; n++) {\n        Iterator it = vector.iterator();\n        while(it.hasNext()) {\n            writer.print((Integer)it.next() + \" \");\n        }\n\n        boolean isPrime = true;\n        for (int i = 0; i < vector.size(); i++) {\n            int primeNumber = ((Integer)vector.elementAt(i)).intValue();\n            if (primeNumber > Math.sqrt(n)) break;\n            if (n % primeNumber == 0) {\n                isPrime = false;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n\n        if (isPrime) {\n            count ++;\n            vector.addElement(new Integer(n));\n            if (count % NUMBER_PER_LINE == 0) {\n                writer.println(n);\n            } else {\n                writer.write(n + \" \");\n            }\n        }\n    }\n} catch (Exception e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n} finally {\n    if (writer != null) {\n        writer.close();\n    }\n}\n\nThis code will write the prime numbers to the file named \"VectorDump\". If an error occurs while writing to the file, it will be caught and printed to the console. After all data has been written to the file, the file will be closed.\n\nA: You can use the PrintWriter's println method to write to the file. The println method writes a line terminator to the file.\nwriter.println(n);\n\nThis will write the value of n followed by a line terminator (which is a newline character in most systems) to the file.\nHere's how your updated code should look:\nPrintWriter writer = null;\ntry {\n    writer = new PrintWriter(\"VectorDump\", \"UTF-8\");\n    for (int n = 2; n < 92; n++) {\n        Iterator it = vector.iterator();\n        while(it.hasNext()) {\n            writer.print((Integer)it.next() + \" \");\n        }\n\n        boolean isPrime = true;\n        for (int i = 0; i < vector.size(); i++) {\n            int primeNumber = ((Integer)vector.elementAt(i)).intValue();\n            if (primeNumber > Math.sqrt(n)) break;\n            if (n % primeNumber == 0) {\n                isPrime = false;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n\n        if (isPrime) {\n            count ++;\n            vector.addElement(new Integer(n));\n            if (count % NUMBER_PER_LINE == 0) {\n                writer.println(n);\n            } else {\n                writer.write(n + \" \");\n            }\n        }\n    }\n} catch (Exception e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n} finally {\n    if (writer != null) {\n        writer.close();\n    }\n}\n\nThis code will write the prime numbers to the file named \"VectorDump\". If an error occurs while writing to the file, it will be caught and printed to the console. After all data has been written to the file, the file will be closed.\n\nA: You can use the PrintWriter's println method to write to the file. The println method writes a line terminator to the file.\nwriter.println(n"}
