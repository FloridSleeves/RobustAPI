You can do this by creating a new method in your FooIterator class that takes an E and a Bar, and then call this method in your next() method. Here's an example:\n\n```java\npublic class FooIterator<E> implements Iterator<E> {\n  public FooIterator(Collection<Bar> bars) {\n    innerIterator = bars.iterator();\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public boolean hasNext() {\n    return innerIterator.hasNext();\n  }\n\n  @SuppressWarnings(\"unchecked\")\n  @Override\n  public E next() {\n    Bar bar = innerIterator.next();\n    return createNewInstance(bar);\n  }\n\n  private E createNewInstance(Bar bar) {\n    try {\n      return (E) Class.forName(E.class.getName()).getConstructor(Bar.class).newInstance(bar);\n    } catch (Exception e) {\n      throw new RuntimeException(\"Class \" + E.class.getName() + \" must have a constructor that takes a Bar\", e);\n    }\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public void remove() {\n    throw new UnsupportedOperationException(\"Don't remove from FooIterator!\");\n  }\n\n  private Iterator<Bar> innerIterator;\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, the createNewInstance() method uses reflection to create a new instance of E with a Bar constructor. If the constructor does not exist, or if it throws an exception, it throws a RuntimeException. This way, you can ensure that E must have a constructor that takes a Bar.\n\nPlease note that this solution is not type-safe. If E is not a subclass of Bar, this will not compile. If you want to ensure that E is a subclass of Bar, you would need to add some additional type checking.\n\nAlso, this solution is not recommended for production code. It's a bit of a hack and can lead to runtime errors if the class E does not have a constructor that takes a Bar. It's better to use a factory pattern or a builder pattern to create instances of E.\n\nI hope this helps.
