In this case, the image is located in the \"/img\" context path, so the source is set to \"/img/img.jpg\". The servlet container (in this case Jetty) will then look for the image in the context path \"/img\" of the web application. The image should be located in the \"img\" folder in the root of the jar file.\n\n\nA: The problem is likely that your image is not being served from the context path \"/img\". Instead, it's being served from the root context path \"/\". \n\nYou've set your WebAppContext to be at the context path \"/img\", so it should serve files from the \"/img\" context path. However, you're trying to reference the image with the source \"/img/img.jpg\", which is relative to the root context path \"/\". \n\nYou should change the image source to \"/img/img.jpg\" to reference the image from the \"/img\" context path.\n\nHere's the corrected line of code:\nout.println( \"<img src=\\\"/img/img.jpg\\\">\" );\n\nThis should correctly reference the image from the \"/img\" context path.\n\nA: The problem is that you are trying to access the image from the root context path (\"/\") instead of the context path where your images are served (\"/img\").\nYou should change:\nout.println( \"<img src=\\\"/img/img.jpg\\\">\" );\n\nto:\nout.println( \"<img src=\\\"/img/img.jpg\\\">\" );\n\nThis will correctly reference the image from the \"/img\" context path.\n\nA: The problem is that you are trying to access the image from the root context path (\"/\") instead of the context path where your images are served (\"/img\").\nYou should change:\nout.println( \"<img src=\\\"/img/img.jpg\\\">\" );\n\nto:\nout.println( \"<img src=\\\"/img/img.jpg\\\">\" );\n\nThis will correctly reference the image from the \"/img\" context path.\n\nA: The problem is that you are trying to access the image from the root context path (\"/\") instead of the context path where your images are served (\"/img\").\nYou should change:\nout.println( \"<img src=\\\"/img/img.jpg\\\">\" );\n\nto:\nout.println( \"<img src=\\\"/img/img.jpg\\\">\" );\n\nThis will correctly reference the image from the \"/img\" context path.\n\nA: The problem is that you are trying to access the image from the root context path (\"/\") instead of the context path where your images are served (\"/img\").\nYou should change:\nout.println( \"<img src=\\\"/img/img.jpg\\\">\" );\n\nto:\nout.println( \"<img src=\\\"/img/img.jpg\\\">\" );\n\nThis will correctly reference the image from the \"/img\" context path.\n\nA: The problem is that you are trying to access the image from the root context path (\"/\") instead of the context path where your images are served (\"/img\").\nYou should change:\nout.println( \"<img src=\\\"/img/img.jpg\\\">\" );\n\nto:\nout.println( \"<img src=\\\"/img/img.jpg\\\">\" );\n\nThis will correctly reference the image from the \"/img\" context path.\n\nA: The problem is that you are trying to access the image from the root context path (\"/\") instead of the context path where your images are served (\"/img\").\nYou should change:\nout.println( \"<img src=\\\"/img/img.jpg\\\">\" );\n\nto:\nout.println( \"<img src=\\\"/img/img.jpg\\\">\" );\n\nThis will correctly reference the image from the \"/img\" context path.\n\nA: The problem is that you are trying to access the image from the root context path (\"/\") instead of the context path where your images are served (\"/img\").\nYou should change:\nout.println( \"<img src=\\\"/"}
