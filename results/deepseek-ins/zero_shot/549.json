I went through this way: Preferences -> Java -> Compiler -> Errors / Warnings -> Deprecated and Restricted API. Then i changed errors to warnings. But now i can not use that library efficient, cause eclipse suggest me nothing about that library.My first question is; if there is a better way to do that? Or maybe another way to use this library efficient in eclipse?EDIT: I found out it was a complication of 32 and 64 bit versions. After installing 32bit JDK and reference the jai_imageio.jar it worked fine.And second; Can anybody give a plain example to me about converting .bmp image to jpeg2000 image. That would help a lot to me about undesrtanding the context.Thank you\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Converting images from .bmp to jpeg2000 on java and eclipse error: :I have seen some examples here and installed Java Advanced Imaging Image I/O Tools on my computer, because obviously it is a requirement of processing JPEG2000 images.After install this i am able to import librariese.g. import com.sun.media.imageio.plugins.*;after importing, i should be able to use constructors or methods of that library but i am getting this error: \"Access restriction: The type 'J2KImageWriteParam' is not API (restriction on required library 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Java\\jre1.8.0_77\\lib\\ext\\jai_imageio.jar')\" After a litle bit research, i found out that i can change eclipse preferences and ignore that error.

The hasNext() method is used to check if there are more elements in the list to iterate over.\n\nA: The error message you're seeing is due to the fact that the J2KImageWriteParam class is not part of the public API, and as such, it's subject to change without notice.\n\nThe J2KImageWriteParam class is part of the internal implementation of the JAI Image I/O plugin for JPEG 2000 image format. It's not part of the public API, and as such, it's subject to change without notice.\n\nThis means that you should not rely on it for your code, as it may change in future versions of the library.\n\nIf you need to write JPEG 2000 images, you should use the ImageIO class instead. Here's an example of how you can write a JPEG 2000 image using the ImageIO class:\n\n```java\nBufferedImage image = ImageIO.read(new File(\"input.bmp\"));\nImageIO.write(image, \"jpeg2000\", new File(\"output.jp2\"));\n```\n\nThis code reads a BMP image from a file named \"input.bmp\", and then writes it as a JPEG 2000 image to a file named \"output.jp2\".\n\nPlease note that you need to install the JAI Image I/O plugin for JPEG 2000 support in order to use the ImageIO class to write JPEG 2000 images. You can download it from the Java Advanced Imaging website.\n\nAlso, please note that the BMP format is not supported by the ImageIO class, so you'll need to convert your BMP image to a supported format (like PNG or JPG) before you can use it with the ImageIO class.\n\nI hope this helps, and let me know if you have any other questions.\n\nA: The error message you're seeing is due to the fact that the J2KImageWriteParam class is not part of the public API, and as such, it's subject to change without notice.\n\nThe J2KImageWriteParam class is part of the internal implementation of the JAI Image I/O plugin for JPEG 2000 image format.
