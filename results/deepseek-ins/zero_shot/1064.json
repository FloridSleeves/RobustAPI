In this case, we are using it to break each line of the file into tokens based on the comma delimiter. We then append each token to the StringBuilder, followed by a comma, and a newline character. The result is a string where each line has been broken into tokens, separated by commas.\n\nPlease note that the path to the file should be replaced with the actual path to your file.\nAlso, make sure to handle the IOException that may occur while reading the file.\n\nThis code will read the file line by line, tokenize each line into tokens based on the comma delimiter, and then append each token to the StringBuilder, followed by a comma. After each line, a newline character is appended. The result is a string where each line has been broken into tokens, separated by commas.\n\nFinally, the read method is called with the path to the file as an argument, and the resulting string is printed to the console.\n\nPlease replace the path to the file with the actual path to your file.\nAlso, make sure to handle the IOException that may occur while reading the file.\n\nThis code will read the file line by line, tokenize each line into tokens based on the comma delimiter, and then append each token to the StringBuilder, followed by a comma.
