It provides a method getNextAttachment() to get the next attachment part from the SOAP message. The data of each attachment part can be accessed through the DataHandler of the AttachmentPart.\n\nPlease note that the read method of AttachmentInputStream will read the entire SOAP message and all attachments into memory. If the SOAP message or attachments are large, this might not be efficient. In such cases, you might want to use the read(byte[] b, int off, int len) method of AttachmentInputStream to read the SOAP message and attachments in chunks.\n\nAlso, please note that the available() method of InputStream is not reliable for getting the number of bytes available to read. It might return 0 even if there are bytes available. So, it's better to use the read(byte[] b, int off, int len) method to read the SOAP message and attachments in chunks.\n\nPlease also note that the Apache CXF library is not included in the Java SE distribution. You need to add it to your project manually.\n```\nI hope this helps.\n\nA: You can use the Apache CXF library to parse MTOM/XOP SOAP responses. Apache CXF provides a class called AttachmentInputStream that can be used to read MTOM/XOP SOAP messages. It provides a method getNextAttachment() to get the next attachment part from the SOAP message. The data of each attachment part can be accessed through the DataHandler of the AttachmentPart.\n\nHere is an example of how you can use it:\n\n```java\nInputStream is = ...; // your InputStream\nAttachmentInputStream ais = new AttachmentInputStream(is);\n\n// read the SOAP message\nbyte[] soapMsg = new byte[is.available()];\nais.read(soapMsg);\n\n// read the attachment\nAttachmentPart att = ais.getNextAttachment();\nbyte[] attachment = new byte[(int)att.getSize()];\natt.getDataHandler().writeTo(new ByteArrayOutputStream(attachment));\n```\n\nPlease note that the read method of AttachmentInputStream will read the entire SOAP message and all attachments into memory.

JAXB is a Java API for unmarshalling (reading) XML documents into Java content trees and marshalling (writing) Java content trees back into XML documents.\n\nHere is an example of how you can use it:\n\n```java\nimport javax.xml.bind.*;\nimport javax.xml.soap.*;\n\n// ...\n\n// Create a JAXB context\nJAXBContext jc = JAXBContext.newInstance(YourClass.class);\n\n// Create a SOAP factory\nSOAPFactory soapFactory = SOAPFactory.newInstance();\n\n// Create a SOAP message\nSOAPMessage soapMessage = soapFactory.createMessage();\n\n// Unmarshal the SOAP message"}
