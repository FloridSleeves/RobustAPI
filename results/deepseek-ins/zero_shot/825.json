But some data were missing in log.txt. Why? How can I write to the file correctly?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: $CODE: out.write(result);\n$EXPLANATION: By using PrintWriter.write, you are bypassing the automatic newline character that PrintWriter.println adds at the end of each line. This can cause data loss if the data you are writing is not formatted correctly.\n\nQuestion: How to read a file line by line in Java?\nAnswer: $API: BufferedReader.readLine()\n$CODE: BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"D:/log.txt\"));String line;while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) { System.out.println(line);}\n$EXPLANATION: To read a file line by line in Java, you can use a BufferedReader along with its readLine() method. This method reads a line of text from the file and returns it as a string. The loop continues until readLine() returns null, which indicates the end of the file.\n\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java?\nAnswer: $API: FileReader.read()\n$CODE: FileReader reader = new FileReader(\"D:/log.txt\");int character;while ((character = reader.read()) != -1) { System.out.print((char) character);}\n$EXPLANATION: To read a file in Java, you can use a FileReader along with its read() method. This method reads a single character from the file and returns it as an integer. The loop continues until read() returns -1, which indicates the end of the file. The character is then cast to a char and printed to the console.\n\nQuestion: How to write a file in Java?\nAnswer: $API: FileWriter.write()\n$CODE: FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(\"D:/log.txt\");writer.write(\"Hello, World!\");writer.close();\n$EXPLANATION: To write a file in Java, you can use a FileWriter along with its write() method. This method writes a string to the file. After writing the string, you should always close the FileWriter to free up system resources.\n\nQuestion: How to read a file line by line in Java using BufferedReader?\nAnswer: $API: BufferedReader.readLine()\n$CODE: BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"D:/log.txt\"));String line;while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) { System.out.println(line);}\n$EXPLANATION: To read a file line by line in Java, you can use a BufferedReader along with its readLine() method. This method reads a line of text from the file and returns it as a string. The loop continues until readLine() returns null, which indicates the end of the file.\n\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java using BufferedReader?\nAnswer: $API: BufferedReader.readLine()\n$CODE: BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"D:/log.txt\"));String line;while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) { System.out.println(line);}\n$EXPLANATION: To read a file in Java using BufferedReader, you can use a BufferedReader along with its readLine() method. This method reads a line of text from the file and returns it as a string. The loop continues until readLine() returns null, which indicates the end of the file.\n\nQuestion: How to write a file in Java using BufferedWriter?\nAnswer: $API: BufferedWriter.write()\n$CODE: BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(\"D:/log.txt\"));bw.write(\"Hello, World!\");bw.close();\n$EXPLANATION: To write a file in Java using BufferedWriter, you can use a BufferedWriter along with its write() method. This method writes a string to the file. After writing the string, you should always close the BufferedWriter to free up system resources.\n\nQuestion: How to read a file line by line in Java using FileReader?\nAnswer: $API: FileReader.read()\n$CODE: FileReader reader = new FileReader(\"D:/log.txt\");int character;while ((character = reader.read()) != -1) { System.out.print((char) character);}\n$EXPLANATION: To read a file line by line in Java using FileReader, you can use a FileReader along with its read() method.
