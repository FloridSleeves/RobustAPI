The while loop continues until there are no more lines to read.\n\nA: The issue you're experiencing is not directly related to Checkstyle, but rather to the way files are handled in Java. When you open a file in Java, it's important to remember that the operating system adds a newline character at the end of the file. This is why you're seeing the \"File does not end with a newline\" message.\n\nHowever, when you use BufferedReader.readLine, it doesn't include the newline character in the returned string. So, if you're reading a file and the last line doesn't end with a newline, you'll see this message.\n\nTo fix this, you could manually add a newline character to the end of your file before you read it. Or, you could use a different method to read the file, such as FileUtils.readFileToString from Apache Commons IO, which includes the newline character in the returned string.\n\nHere's an example of how you might use FileUtils.readFileToString:\n\n```java\nString fileContent = FileUtils.readFileToString(new File(\"filename.txt\"), \"UTF-8\");\n```\n\nThis will read the entire file into a string, including the newline character at the end.\n\nI hope this helps clarify the issue and provides a solution.
