We use the hasNext() method to check if there are more rows to iterate over. If there are, we use the next() method to move to the next row and increment the lastRowNum variable. This will give us the total number of rows in the sheet.\n\nA: You can use the getPhysicalNumberOfRows() method of the Sheet class. This method returns the number of physical rows in the sheet.\n\nint j = sheet.getPhysicalNumberOfRows();\n\nThis will give you the total number of rows in the sheet, not just the last row.\n\nA: The getLastRowNum() method returns the index of the last row in the sheet, not the number of rows. So if you have 40 rows in the first sheet, it will return 39 (0-based index).\nIf you want to get the number of rows, you can use the getPhysicalNumberOfRows() method:\nint j = sheet.getPhysicalNumberOfRows();\n\nThis method returns the number of physical rows in the sheet, which is the number of rows including the header row.\nIf you want to get the number of rows excluding the header row, you can subtract 1 from the result:\nint j = sheet.getPhysicalNumberOfRows() - 1;\n\nThis will give you the number of rows in the sheet excluding the header row.\n\nA: The getLastRowNum() method returns the index of the last row in the sheet, not the number of rows. So if you have 40 rows in the first sheet, it will return 39 (0-based index).\nIf you want to get the number of rows, you can use the getPhysicalNumberOfRows() method:\nint j = sheet.getPhysicalNumberOfRows();\n\nThis method returns the number of physical rows in the sheet, which is the number of rows including the header row.\nIf you want to get the number of rows excluding the header row, you can subtract 1 from the result:\nint j = sheet.getPhysicalNumberOfRows() - 1;\n\nThis will give you the number of rows in the sheet excluding the header row.\n\nA: The getLastRowNum() method returns the index of the last row in the sheet, not the number of rows.
