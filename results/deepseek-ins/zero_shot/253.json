It converts each byte to binary string using Integer.toBinaryString() method and appends it to a StringBuilder. After reading the file, it converts the StringBuilder to a String and gets the first 17 bits.\n```\n\nNote: This code will give you the first 17 bits of the file. If you want to read the next 17 bits, you need to move the cursor to the next 17 bits in the file. You can use the seek method of FileInputStream to move the cursor to a specific position in the file.\n```java\nfis.getChannel().position(17); // move cursor to the next 17 bits\n```\n```\n\nPlease replace \"your_file_path\" with the actual path of your file.\n\nNote: This code assumes that the file contains binary data. If the file contains text data, you need to convert the text to binary before reading.\n\nAlso, this code reads the entire file into memory. If the file is large, you might run out of memory. In that case, you need to read and process the file in chunks.\n```\n\nNote: This code will give you the first 17 bits of the file.
