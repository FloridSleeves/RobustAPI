The write() method of PrintWriter class is used to write the text to the client. The response.getWriter() method returns a PrintWriter object which is used to write the text to the client.\n\n```java\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.io.PrintWriter;\nimport javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;\nimport org.apache.struts2.ServletActionContext;\n\npublic class HelloWorldAction extends ActionSupport {\n    public String execute() throws IOException {\n        HttpServletResponse response = ServletActionContext.getResponse();\n        PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();\n        out.write(\"Hello World!\");\n        return NONE;\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this code, the execute() method is overridden to return NONE. This means that the result is not mapped to any result, so no result is returned. Instead, the response is written directly to the client using the PrintWriter.\n<|EOT|>"}
