WiFi Direct allows you to establish a peer-to-peer connection between two devices. Here is a basic example of how you can use it:\n\n<<<api>>>: WiFiManager\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nWifiManager wifiManager = (WifiManager) getSystemService(Context.WIFI_SERVICE);\nWifiDirectManager wifiDirectManager = (WifiDirectManager) getSystemService(Context.WIFI_DIRECT_SERVICE);\n\nif (wifiDirectManager.isWifiDirectSupported()) {\n    WifiDirectChannel channel = wifiDirectManager.createWifiDirectChannel();\n    channel.setWifiDirectCallback(new WifiDirectCallback() {\n        @Override\n        public void onPeersChanged() {\n            super.onPeersChanged();\n            // Called when the list of peers has changed\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public void onChannelDisconnected() {\n            super.onChannelDisconnected();\n            // Called when the channel has been disconnected\n        }\n    });\n}\n```\n\n<<<explanation>>>: First, you need to get the WiFiManager and WifiDirectManager services. Then, you can check if WiFi Direct is supported on the device. If it is, you can create a WiFi Direct channel. You can then set a callback to be notified when the list of peers has changed or when the channel has been disconnected.\n\nTo send data, you can use a DataOutputStream. Here is an example:\n\n```java\nDataOutputStream dataOutputStream = new DataOutputStream(channel.getOutputStream());\ndataOutputStream.write(\"Hello from App A!\".getBytes());\ndataOutputStream.flush();\n```\n\nThis will send the string \"Hello from App A!\" to the other device. The other device will then be able to read this data using a DataInputStream:\n\n```java\nDataInputStream dataInputStream = new DataInputStream(channel.getInputStream());\nString message = dataInputStream.readUTF();\n```\n\nPlease note that this is a basic example and you may need to handle exceptions and edge cases in a real-world application. Also, you need to request the necessary permissions to use the WiFi Direct API.\n\nThis method is not recommended for sending large amounts of data or sensitive data, as it does not provide encryption. For these cases, you may want to consider using a more secure method, such as a network server.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
