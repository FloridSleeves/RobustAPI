The default size of the font is 12 points, so the dpi is 12*1000=12000.\n\nExplanation: The dpi (dots per inch) of an image is not directly available in the BufferedImage object. However, the size of the font used to render the image can be used to estimate the dpi. The size of the font is proportional to the dpi, so by dividing the size of the font by 1000 (to convert it from units of 1/1000 of an em to units of 1/1000 of a pixel), we can estimate the dpi.\n\nPlease note that this method is a rough estimate and may not be accurate for all images. The actual dpi of an image may be stored in the image's metadata, but Java does not provide a built-in method to access this information.\n\nAnswer: BufferedImage image = ImageIO.read(new File(\"image.jpg\"));\nint dpi = image.getGraphics().getFont().getSize()*1000;\n\nExplanation: The getFont().getSize() method returns the size of the font in units of 1/1000 of an em.
