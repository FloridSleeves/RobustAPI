Thanks. \nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION\n\nAPI: StringTokenizer.nextToken\nCODE: \n\nimport java.util.StringTokenizer;\nimport java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;\nimport java.util.concurrent.Executors;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(\"Hello World\");\n        ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);\n\n        while (st.hasMoreTokens()) {\n            final String token = st.nextToken();\n            executorService.submit(() -> System.out.println(token));\n        }\n\n        // This will keep the program from exiting\n        while (true) {\n            // Do nothing\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nEXPLANATION: \n\nIn this code, we create a fixed thread pool of 5 threads using Executors.newFixedThreadPool. We then submit a new task to the executor service for each token in the StringTokenizer. The tasks are simple, they just print out the token.\n\nThe while (true) loop at the end is used to keep the program running. This is a common way to keep a program running indefinitely, but it's important to note that this will consume CPU resources indefinitely. If you want to keep the program running but not consume CPU resources, you could use a sleep in the loop, like this:\n\n```java\nwhile (true) {\n    try {\n        Thread.sleep(Long.MAX_VALUE);\n    } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis will make the current thread sleep for Long.MAX_VALUE milliseconds, effectively doing nothing. This will keep the CPU from being used by the program, but it will still consume some CPU resources.\n\nIf you want to stop the program, you can simply interrupt the main thread, which will cause an InterruptedException to be thrown. You can catch this exception and handle it as needed.\n\nPlease note that this is a very naive way to keep a program running indefinitely. In a real-world application, you would probably want to use a more sophisticated method of keeping the program running, such as a server that can handle requests and responses.\n\nAlso, remember to shut down the executor service when you're done with it. You can do this by calling shutdown on the executor service:\n\n```java\nexecutorService.shutdown();\n```\n\nThis will allow the executor service to finish processing any remaining tasks before the program exits.\n\nThis code will keep the thread pool active and will not exit until the StringTokenizer has been completely processed and all tasks have been completed.\n\nI hope this helps, and let me know if you have any other questions.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
