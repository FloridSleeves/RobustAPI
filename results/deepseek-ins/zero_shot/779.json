The string is converted to bytes using the UTF-8 encoding before being written to the file.\n\nQuestion: How to write a string to a file in UTF-8 encoding using FileOutputStream:\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: FileOutputStream\n<<<code>>>: new FileOutputStream(new File(filename), true)\n<<<explanation>>>: The FileOutputStream constructor can be used to create a new FileOutputStream that writes to a file in UTF-8 encoding. The second parameter of the constructor is a boolean that specifies whether to append to the file or not.\n\nQuestion: How to specify the encoding when creating a FileOutputStream:\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: FileOutputStream\n<<<code>>>: new FileOutputStream(new File(filename), true)\n<<<explanation>>>: The FileOutputStream constructor does not directly support specifying an encoding. However, you can use the OutputStreamWriter to wrap the FileOutputStream and specify the encoding.\n\nQuestion: How to write a string to a file in UTF-8 encoding using OutputStreamWriter:\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: OutputStreamWriter\n<<<code>>>: new OutputStreamWriter(new FileOutputStream(new File(filename), true), \"UTF-8\")\n<<<explanation>>>: The OutputStreamWriter constructor can be used to create a new OutputStreamWriter that writes to a file in UTF-8 encoding. The second parameter of the constructor is the encoding to use.\n\nQuestion: How to specify the encoding when creating a OutputStreamWriter:\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: OutputStreamWriter\n<<<code>>>: new OutputStreamWriter(new FileOutputStream(new File(filename), true), \"UTF-8\")\n<<<explanation>>>: The OutputStreamWriter constructor can be used to create a new OutputStreamWriter that writes to a file in a specified encoding. The second parameter of the constructor is the encoding to use.\n\nQuestion: How to write a string to a file in UTF-8 encoding using BufferedWriter:\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: BufferedWriter\n<<<code>>>: new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(new FileOutputStream(new File(filename), true), \"UTF-8\"))\n<<<explanation>>>: The BufferedWriter constructor can be used to create a new BufferedWriter that writes to a file in UTF-8 encoding. The second parameter of the constructor is the Writer to use for buffering.\n\nQuestion: How to specify the encoding when creating a BufferedWriter:\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: BufferedWriter\n<<<code>>>: new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(new FileOutputStream(new File(filename), true), \"UTF-8\"))\n<<<explanation>>>: The BufferedWriter constructor can be used to create a new BufferedWriter that writes to a file in a specified encoding. The second parameter of the constructor is the Writer to use for buffering.\n\nQuestion: How to write a string to a file in UTF-8 encoding using PrintWriter:\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: PrintWriter\n<<<code>>>: new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(new FileOutputStream(new File(filename), true), \"UTF-8\")))\n<<<explanation>>>: The PrintWriter constructor can be used to create a new PrintWriter that writes to a file in UTF-8 encoding.
