Can anyone please point me to the directions for a good Java learning resource also.@TargetApi(Build.VERSION_CODES.HONEYCOMB)public class MainActivity extends ActionBarActivity {public MediaPlayer mediaPlayer;@Overrideprotected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {    /*super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);*/    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);    getActionBar().hide();    mediaPlayer = new MediaPlayer();  //getting an error on this line for invalid syntax.     //not sure what to put here        playB() throws IOException {            playSound(R.raw.b)        }     //not sure what to put here         playSound(int resId) throws IOException {             URI uri = URI.parse(\"android://com.max.bead/\" + resId);             if(mediaPlayer.isPlaying())             {                 mediaPlayer.stop();             }             else             {                 mediaPlayer.setDataSource(getApplicationContext(), uri);                 mediaPlayer.prepare();                 mediaPlayer.play();             }         }}\nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: setContentView\n<<<code>>>: setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n<<<explanation>>>: This method sets the activity's layout to the one specified in the parameter. In this case, it is set to the layout file activity_main.\n\nQuestion: What is the purpose of the line \"getActionBar().hide();\"?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: getActionBar().hide();\n<<<code>>>: getActionBar().hide();\n<<<explanation>>>: This line of code is used to hide the action bar at the top of the screen. The action bar is usually used to display options and menu items, but in this case, it is not needed, so it is hidden.\n\nQuestion: What is the purpose of the line \"mediaPlayer = new MediaPlayer();\"?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: MediaPlayer mediaPlayer = new MediaPlayer();\n<<<code>>>: MediaPlayer mediaPlayer = new MediaPlayer();\n<<<explanation>>>: This line of code is creating a new MediaPlayer object. A MediaPlayer object is used to play audio files in Android. The new MediaPlayer object is stored in the variable 'mediaPlayer'.\n\nQuestion: What is the purpose of the method \"playB()\"?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: playB()\n<<<code>>>: playB() throws IOException { playSound(R.raw.b); }\n<<<explanation>>>: This method is used to play the sound file 'b'. The sound file is identified by its resource ID, which is R.raw.b. The 'throws IOException' part is used to indicate that this method may throw an IOException, which is a type of exception that can occur when trying to play a sound file.\n\nQuestion: What is the purpose of the method \"playSound(int resId)?\"\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: playSound(int resId)\n<<<code>>>: playSound(int resId) throws IOException { URI uri = URI.parse(\"android://com.max.bead/\" + resId); if(mediaPlayer.isPlaying()) { mediaPlayer.stop(); } else { mediaPlayer.setDataSource(getApplicationContext(), uri); mediaPlayer.prepare(); mediaPlayer.play(); } }\n<<<explanation>>>: This method is used to play a sound file specified by its resource ID. The sound file is identified by its resource ID, which is passed as a parameter to this method. The 'throws IOException' part is used to indicate that this method may throw an IOException, which is a type of exception that can occur when trying to play a sound file. The method first checks if a sound is already playing. If a sound is playing, it stops the sound. Then it sets the data source of the MediaPlayer to the sound file specified by the resource ID. It prepares the MediaPlayer for playback and then plays the sound.\n\nLearning resources:\n1. Official Java Documentation: The official Java documentation is a great resource to learn Java from.
