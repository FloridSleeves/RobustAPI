The string \"text\" is written to the output stream of the socket.\n\nQuestion: How to receive data in Sinatra:\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: params\n<<<code>>>: params['key']\n<<<explanation>>>: In Sinatra, you can access the data sent by the client using the 'params' hash. The keys in the 'params' hash are the names of the form fields. In your case, you would use 'text' as the key to access the data sent by the client.\n\nQuestion: How to send data from Java client to Sinatra server:\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: writer.write(text);\n<<<explanation>>>: This line of code is used to send data to the server.
