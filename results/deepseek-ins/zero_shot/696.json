It would be great, if anybody can help me or provide me with some good pointers to inject/pass context into the new thread.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: writer.write(\"<html>\");\n<<<explanation>>>: You can use PrintWriter.write to write to the response. This will not create a new thread, so it will have access to the servlet context.\n\nPlease note that this solution is not thread-safe. If you need to write to the response from multiple threads, you should use a thread-safe approach, such as a StringBuilder or a synchronized block.\n\nAlso, remember that the response has already been committed by the time the new thread is started, so you cannot write to the response anymore. You should pass the data you want to write to the response to the new thread and then write it from the main thread after the response has been committed.\n\nHere is an example of how you can modify your code to use PrintWriter.write:\n\n```java\nprotected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {\n    PrintWriter writer = response.getWriter();\n    writer.println(\"<html>\");\n    writer.println(\"<head><title>Hello World Servlet</title></head>\");\n    writer.println(\"<body>\");\n    writer.println(\"<h1>Context injection into Thread Experiment</h1>\");\n\n    // Start a new thread to execute the doIt method\n    Thread thread = new Thread(new Runnable() {\n        @Override\n        public void run() {\n            try {\n                doIt();\n            } catch (Exception e) {\n                e.printStackTrace();\n            }\n        }\n    });\n    thread.start();\n\n    writer.println(\"</body>\");\n    writer.println(\"</html>\");\n    writer.close();\n\n    // Wait for the new thread to finish\n    try {\n        thread.join();\n    } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    }\n}\n\nprotected void doIt() throws Exception {\n    if (getBeanManager() == null) {\n        throw new Exception(\"BEAN MANAGER IS NULL\");\n    }\n}\n\npublic static BeanManager getBeanManager() {\n    try {\n        InitialContext initialContext = new InitialContext();\n        return (BeanManager) initialContext.lookup(\"java:comp/BeanManager\");\n    } catch (NamingException e) {\n        logger.info(\"Couldn't get BeanManager through JNDI\");\n        return null;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, the doGet method starts a new thread to execute the doIt method. The doIt method checks if the BeanManager is null and throws an exception if it is. The main thread then waits for the new thread to finish using the join method. This way, the new thread will have access to the servlet context.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n"}
