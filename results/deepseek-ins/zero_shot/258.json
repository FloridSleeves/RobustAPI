Assume that all  words are space delimited and treat punctuation the same as letters.this image was included to help with the design of the algorithm: what is the most efficient way of implementing this in JAVA?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\npublic String reverseWords(String s) {\n    List<String> words = Arrays.asList(s.split(\" \"));\n    Collections.reverse(words);\n    return String.join(\" \", words);\n}\n```\n<<<explan\ufffdation>>>: This function works by splitting the input string into a list of words using the split method. It then reverses the order of the words in the list using Collections.reverse. Finally, it joins the words back together into a single string with spaces in between using the String.join method.\n```\nQuestion: What is the time complexity of this function?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Time complexity\n<<<code>>>: The time complexity of this function is O(n)\n<<<explanation>>>: The split method has a time complexity of O(n), the Collections.reverse method has a time complexity of O(n), and the String.join method also has a time complexity of O(n). Since these operations are all performed on the same input string, the overall time complexity is O(n).\n```\nQuestion: What is the space complexity of this function?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Space complexity\n<<<code>>>: The space complexity of this function is also O(n)\n<<<explanation>>>: The split method creates a new list of words, which requires O(n) space. The Collections.reverse method also requires O(n) space to store the list. The String.join method creates a new string, which requires O(n) space. Since these operations are all performed on the same input string, the overall space complexity is O(n).\n```\nQuestion: How would you modify this function to handle punctuation?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: String.split\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\npublic String reverseWords(String s) {\n    List<String> words = Arrays.asList(s.split(\"\\\\s+\"));\n    Collections.reverse(words);\n    return String.join(\" \", words);\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: The regular expression \"\\\\s+\" is used in the split method to split the string on one or more whitespace characters. This will correctly handle words with punctuation attached to them, such as \"don't\" or \"can't\".\n```\n```\nQuestion: What is the time complexity of this modified function?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Time complexity\n<<<code>>>: The time complexity of this modified function is still O(n)\n<<<explanation>>>: The split method still has a time complexity of O(n), the Collections.reverse method has a time complexity of O(n), and the String.join method also has a time complexity of O(n). Since these operations are all performed on the same input string, the overall time complexity is still O(n).\n```\nQuestion: What is the space complexity of this modified function?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Space complexity\n<<<code>>>: The space complexity of this modified function is still O(n)\n<<<explanation>>>: The split method still creates a new list of words, which requires O(n) space. The Collections.reverse method also requires O(n) space to store the list. The String.join method still creates a new string, which requires O(n) space. Since these operations are all performed on the same input string, the overall space complexity is still O(n).\n```\n```\nQuestion: How would you modify this function to handle multiple languages?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: String.split\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\npublic String reverseWords(String s) {\n    List<String> words = Arrays.asList(s.split(\"\\\\W+\"));\n    Collections.reverse(words);\n    return String.join(\" \", words);\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: The regular expression \"\\\\W+\" is used in the split method to split the string on one or more non-word characters. This will correctly handle words in multiple languages, such as \"h\u00e9llo\" or \"caf\u00e9\".\n```\n```\nQuestion: What is the time complexity of this modified function?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Time complexity\n<<<code>>>: The time complexity of this modified function is still O(n)\n<<<explan"}
