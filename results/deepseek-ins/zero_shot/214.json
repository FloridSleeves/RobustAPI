I tried the read() method but it was blocked too.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\npublic static String readStr(Socket client) throws IOException {\n    InputStream inStream = client.getInputStream();\n    byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\n    int read;\n    StringBuilder answer = new StringBuilder();\n    while ((read = inStream.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n        answer.append(new String(buffer, 0, read));\n    }\n    return answer.toString();\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: The read method of InputStream reads the data from the stream into the buffer. The read method returns the number of bytes read into the buffer, or -1 if there is no more data to read. We use a StringBuilder to append the data read from the buffer to the answer. We keep reading until there is no more data to read (read = -1). The data is then converted to a String and appended to the answer. The answer is then returned as a String.\n\nNote: This code assumes that the server sends data in UTF-8 encoding. If the server sends data in a different encoding, you need to specify the encoding when creating the String from the buffer. For example, if the server sends data in ISO-8859-1 encoding, you can use new String(buffer, 0, read, \"ISO-8859-1\").\n\nAlso, this code does not handle the case where the server sends data in chunks that are larger than the buffer size. If the server sends data in chunks larger than the buffer size, you need to handle this case. You can do this by reading the data in chunks of the buffer size and appending it to the answer.\n\nFinally, this code does not handle the case where the server sends data that is not terminated by a newline character. If the server sends data that is not terminated by a newline character, you need to handle this case. You can do this by checking if the last character of the answer is a newline character before returning the answer. If it is not a newline character, you can append a newline character to the answer.\n\nPlease note that this code does not handle the case where the server sends data that is not a valid UTF-8 string. If the server sends data that is not a valid UTF-8 string, you need to handle this case. You can do this by checking if the data is a valid UTF-8 string before appending it to the answer. If the data is not a valid UTF-8 string, you can handle this case by throwing an exception or by ignoring the invalid data.\n\nAlso, this code does not handle the case where the server sends data that is larger than the maximum size of a String. If the server sends data that is larger than the maximum size of a String, you need to handle this case. You can do this by using a StringBuilder instead of a String to append the data to the answer. The StringBuilder class in Java can handle strings of any size.\n\nPlease note that this code does not handle the case where the server sends data that is not a valid UTF-8 string.
