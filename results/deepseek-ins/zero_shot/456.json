The Iterator.remove() method removes from the underlying collection the last element returned by this iterator. This method can be called only once per call to next(). If the remove method is called more than once in a row, it will throw an exception.\n\nQuestion: How to sort a list of objects in Java?\nAnswer: $CODE: list.sort(Comparator.comparing(Object::getterName));$EXPLANATION: Java 8 introduced a new method in the List interface called sort. This method sorts the elements of the list in-place. The sort method takes a Comparator as a parameter. A Comparator is a functional interface that provides a single method called compare. This method takes two parameters and returns an integer. If the result is negative, the first parameter is considered smaller than the second. If the result is positive, the first parameter is considered greater than the second. If the result is 0, the parameters are considered equal. The Comparator.comparing method is a utility method that takes a function that extracts a Comparable value from an object and returns a Comparator that compares based on that value.\n\nQuestion: What is the difference between a List and a Set in Java?\nAnswer: $CODE: // Code not required for this question$EXPLANATION: A List in Java is an ordered collection of elements. It allows duplicate elements. Lists in Java are indexed and can contain duplicate elements. They maintain the insertion order. A Set in Java is an unordered collection of objects in which duplicate values cannot be stored. Java provides classes like HashSet, LinkedHashSet, and TreeSet to create a set.\n\nQuestion: What is the difference between a List and a Map in Java?\nAnswer: $CODE: // Code not required for this question$EXPLANATION: A List in Java is an ordered collection of elements. It allows duplicate elements. Lists in Java are indexed and can contain duplicate elements. They maintain the insertion order. A Map in Java is an object that maps keys to values. A map cannot contain duplicate keys; each key can map to at most one value. Java provides classes like HashMap, LinkedHashMap, and TreeMap to create a map.\n\nQuestion: What is the difference between a Set and a Map in Java?\nAnswer: $CODE: // Code not required for this question$EXPLANATION: A Set in Java is an unordered collection of objects in which duplicate values cannot be stored. Java provides classes like HashSet, LinkedHashSet, and TreeSet to create a set. A Map in Java is an object that maps keys to values. A map cannot contain duplicate keys; each key can map to at most one value. Java provides classes like HashMap, LinkedHashMap, and TreeMap to create a map.\n\nQuestion: What is the difference between a Queue and a Stack in Java?\nAnswer: $CODE: // Code not required for this question$EXPLANATION: A Stack in Java is a subtype of Vector that implements the Stack interface. It is a last-in-first-out (LIFO) data structure. The methods for stack are push, pop, peek, and isEmpty. A Queue in Java is an interface and there are classes like LinkedList, PriorityQueue, ArrayDeque, etc. that implement the Queue interface. It is a first-in-first-out (FIFO) data structure. The methods for queue are add, remove, peek, and isEmpty.\n\nQuestion: What is the difference between a PriorityQueue and a Queue in Java?\nAnswer: $CODE: // Code not required for this question$EXPLANATION: A Queue in Java is an interface and there are classes like LinkedList, PriorityQueue, ArrayDeque, etc. that implement the Queue interface. It is a first-in-first-out (FIFO) data structure. The methods for queue are add, remove, peek, and isEmpty. A PriorityQueue in Java is a class that implements the Queue interface. It is an unbounded queue based on a priority heap. The elements of the priority queue are ordered"}
