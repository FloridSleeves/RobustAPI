How can I monitor the download progress?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: Your code is almost correct, but the problem is that you are not updating the progress in real-time. The publishProgress() function is used to inform the onProgressUpdate() function about the progress, but it does not automatically update the progress bar. You need to update the progress bar in the onProgressUpdate() function.\n\nHere is the corrected code:\n\nprotected Long doInBackground(URL...urls) {\n    for (int i = 0; i < urls.length; i++) {\n        url = urls[i];\n        try {\n            URLConnection conn = url.openConnection();\n            conn.connect();\n            totalSize = conn.getContentLength();\n            BufferedInputStream bis = new BufferedInputStream(url.openStream());\n            FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().getPath() + \"/forvo_temp.mp3\");\n            BufferedOutputStream bos = new BufferedOutputStream(fos,1024);\n            byte [] data = new byte[1024];\n            int x=0; int c=0;\n            while((x=bis.read(data,0,1024))>=0){\n                bos.write(data,0,x);\n                c += 1024;\n                publishProgress(c);\n            }\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n    return 0L;\n}\n\nprotected void onProgressUpdate(Integer...args) {\n    if (pd == null) {\n        pd = ProgressDialog.show(context, \"Downloading...\", \"Downloading...\", true, false);\n    }\n    pd.setProgress(args[0]);\n}\n\nIn this code, the progress is updated in real-time by calling publishProgress() in the doInBackground() function and then updating the progress bar in the onProgressUpdate() function. The progress bar is updated by calling setProgress() on the ProgressDialog.\n\nPlease note that the progress is not in percentage form, but the number of bytes downloaded. If you want to display the progress in percentage form, you need to calculate the percentage yourself.\n\nThis should solve your problem.\n\nNote: The ProgressDialog will not show up until the file is completely downloaded. If you want the ProgressDialog to show up as soon as the file starts downloading, you need to move the ProgressDialog creation to the onPreExecute() function and update the progress in the onProgressUpdate() function.\n\nI hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\nNote: The code you provided uses the BufferedInputStream to read the file. This is not the best way to read a file in Android because it reads the whole file into memory. If you are downloading a large file, you should use a FileOutputStream and a FileInputStream to write and read the file.\n\nI hope this helps.
