The channel.disconnect() will close the channel and terminate the process on the client side.\n\nQuestion: How to kill a process before disconnecting:\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION\n\nAPI: channel.sendSignal(\"KILL\")\nCODE: channel.disconnect();\nEXPLANATION: The sendSignal(\"KILL\") method sends a SIGKILL signal to the process running on the server side. This will terminate the process immediately. Afterwards, the channel.disconnect() method is used to cleanly disconnect the channel and terminate the process on the client side.\n\nQuestion: How to handle the exception: com.jcraft.jsch.JSchException: failed to send channel request:\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION\n\nAPI: try-catch block\nCODE: try {\n    channel.sendSignal(\"KILL\");\n} catch (JSchException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\nEXPLANATION: The JSchException is thrown when there is a problem sending the channel request. In the try-catch block, we can handle this exception and print the stack trace to help debug the issue.\n\nQuestion: How to cleanly disconnect:\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION\n\nAPI: channel.disconnect()\nCODE: channel.disconnect();\nEXPLANATION: The channel.disconnect() method is used to cleanly disconnect the channel and terminate the process on the client side.\n\nQuestion: How to tail a server-log:\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION\n\nAPI: JSch\nCODE: JSch ssh = new JSch();\n    Session session = ssh.getSession(\"username\", \"hostname\", 22);\n    session.setPassword(\"password\");\n    session.connect();\n    Channel channel = session.openChannel(\"exec\");\n    ((ChannelExec) channel).setCommand(\"tail -f /path/to/logfile\");\n    channel.connect();\n    InputStream in = channel.getInputStream();\n    byte[] tmp = new byte[1024];\n    while (true) {\n        while (in.available() > 0) {\n            int i = in.read(tmp, 0, 1024);\n            if (i < 0) break;\n            System.out.print(new String(tmp, 0, i));\n        }\n    }\nEXPLANATION: JSch is a Java library that provides a secure encrypted communication between two hosts. In this case, we use it to establish an SSH session and execute the \"tail -f\" command on the server to tail the server-log. The log is then read from the InputStream and printed to the console.\n\nQuestion: How to handle the exception: com.jcraft.jsch.JSchException: Auth fail:\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION\n\nAPI: try-catch block\nCODE: try {\n    session.connect();\n} catch (JSchException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\nEXPLANATION: The JSchException is thrown when there is a problem authenticating with the server. In the try-catch block, we can handle this exception and print the stack trace to help debug the issue.\n\nQuestion: How to handle the exception: com.jcraft.jsch.JSchException: UnknownHostKey:\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION\n\nAPI: try-catch block\nCODE: try {\n    session.connect();\n} catch (JSchException e) {\n    if (\"UnknownHostKey\".equals(e"}
