Here is an example:\npublic class IteratorWrapper<T> implements Iterator<T> {\n    private Iterator<T> iterator;\n    private T firstElement;\n\n    public IteratorWrapper(Iterator<T> iterator) {\n        this.iterator = iterator;\n        if (iterator.hasNext()) {\n            firstElement = iterator.next();\n        }\n    }\n\n    public T getFirstElement() {\n        return firstElement;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public boolean hasNext() {\n        return iterator.hasNext();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public T next() {\n        return iterator.next();\n    }\n\n    // Implement other methods as needed\n}\n\nThen you can use this wrapper class in your method:\npublic void methodAcceptingIterator(IteratorWrapper<String> it) {\n    String firstElement = it.getFirstElement();\n    Iterator<String> iterator = it.getIterator();\n    while (iterator.hasNext()) {\n        // process the iterator\n    }\n}\n\nThis way, you can still process the iterator after retrieving the first element without changing the signature and implementation of the method.\n\nA: You can use a PeekingIterator from the Guava library. It's an Iterator that allows you to peek at the next element without consuming it.\nHere is an example:\nPeekingIterator<String> it = PeekingIterator.peekingIterator(yourIterator);\nString firstElement = it.next(); // get the first element\nwhile(it.hasNext()){\n    String nextElement = it.peek(); // peek at the next element without consuming it\n    // process the iterator\n}\n\nThis way, you can process the iterator after retrieving the first element.\n\nA: You can use a PeekingIterator from the Guava library.
