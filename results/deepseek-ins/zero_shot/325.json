Given:Iterable<String> strings;create a String containing all the strings, separated by commas.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:\n<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nIterator<String> iterator = strings.iterator();\nStringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\n    builder.append(iterator.next()).append(\", \");\n}\nString result = builder.toString();\nif (result.length() > 0) {\n    result = result.substring(0, result.length() - 2); // remove the last comma and space\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: This code creates an iterator over the strings. It then uses a StringBuilder to build the result string. The `append` method is used to add each string followed by a comma and space. After the loop, if the result string is not empty, it removes the last comma and space using the `substring` method.\n\n```java\n```\n\nQuestion: How to emit a comma-separated list?: :This is profoundly simple, yet I've seen many variants, and I don't see my own practice much elsewhere.

The `collect` method is then used with `Collectors.joining` to create a string containing all the strings, separated by commas. The `joining` method takes a delimiter as its argument, which in this case is a comma followed by a space.\n\n```\n```\n\nQuestion: How to emit a comma-separated list?: :This is profoundly simple, yet I've seen many variants, and I don't see my own practice much elsewhere.

The `reduce` method is then used to combine all the strings into a single string. The function passed to `reduce` takes two strings and concatenates them with a comma and space in between. The result is an Optional containing the combined string, or an empty Optional if the stream is empty.\n\n```\n```\n\nQuestion: How to emit a comma-separated list?: :This is profoundly simple, yet I've seen many variants, and I don't see my own practice much elsewhere.
