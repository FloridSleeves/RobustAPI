It is similar to the String.split() method in J2SE.\n\nQuestion: How do I convert a string to an integer in J2ME? : How do I convert a string to an integer in J2ME in an effective way? There is a Integer.parseInt() method in the standard edition (J2SE), but it is absent in the micro edition (J2ME, MIDP).\n\nAnswer: $CODE\n\n<<<api>>>: Integer.valueOf()\n<<<code>>>: \nString str = \"123\";\nint i = Integer.valueOf(str).intValue();\n<<<explanation>>>: The Integer.valueOf() method in J2ME is used to convert a string to an integer. It returns an Integer instance representing the specified string. The intValue() method is then used to get the int value.\n\nQuestion: How do I convert an integer to a string in J2ME? : How do I convert an integer to a string in J2ME in an effective way? There is a Integer.toString() method in the standard edition (J2SE), but it is absent in the micro edition (J2ME, MIDP).\n\nAnswer: $CODE\n\n<<<api>>>: String.valueOf()\n<<<code>>>: \nint i = 123;\nString str = String.valueOf(i);\n<<<explanation>>>: The String.valueOf() method in J2ME is used to convert an integer to a string. It returns a String object representing the specified integer.\n\nQuestion: How do I get the length of a string in J2ME? : How do I get the length of a string in J2ME in an effective way? There is a String.length() method in the standard edition (J2SE), but it is absent in the micro edition (J2ME, MIDP).\n\nAnswer: $CODE\n\n<<<api>>>: String.length()\n<<<code>>>: \nString str = \"Hello\";\nint length = str.length();\n<<<explanation>>>: The length() method in J2ME is used to get the length of a string. It returns the number of characters in the string.\n\nQuestion: How do I get a substring in J2ME? : How do I get a substring in J2ME in an effective way? There is a String.substring() method in the standard edition (J2SE), but it is absent in the micro edition (J2ME, MIDP).\n\nAnswer: $CODE\n\n<<<api>>>: String.substring()\n<<<code>>>: \nString str = \"Hello\";\nString subStr = str.substring(1, 3);\n<<<explanation>>>: The substring() method in J2ME is used to get a substring from the given string. It returns a new string that is a substring of the given string. The substring begins at the specified beginIndex and extends to the character at index endIndex - 1.\n\nQuestion: How do I compare strings in J2ME? : How do I compare strings in J2ME in an effective way? There is a String.compareTo() method in the standard edition (J2SE), but it is absent in the micro edition (J2ME, MIDP).\n\nAnswer: $CODE\n\n<<<api>>>: String.compareTo()\n<<<code>>>: \nString str1 = \"Hello\";\nString str2 = \"World\";\nint result = str1.compareTo(str2);\n<<<explanation>>>: The compareTo() method in J2ME is used to compare two strings lexicographically. It returns an integer indicating whether the first string is less than, equal to, or greater than the second string.\n\nQuestion: How do I check if a string is empty in J2ME? : How do I check if a string is empty in J2ME in an effective way? There is a String.isEmpty() method in the standard edition (J2SE), but it is absent in the micro edition (J2ME, MIDP"}
