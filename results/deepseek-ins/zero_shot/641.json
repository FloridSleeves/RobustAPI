It then iterates over the map to find the key with the highest value (the mode). The mode is the number that appears most frequently in the array.\n\nThe code uses the Math.floor function to round each number to two decimal places. The multiplication by 100 and division by 100 are used to round to two decimal places. The getOrDefault method is used to initialize the count of a number to 0 if it is not already in the map.\n\nThe time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the length of the array. This is because it iterates over the array twice: once to create the map and once to find the mode. The space complexity is also O(n), because in the worst case, each number in the array could be a unique key in the map.\n\nThis code is more efficient than the previous one because it avoids the need to decrease the precision multiple times and it uses a map to count the occurrences of each number, which is a common way to find the mode.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the array contains at least one element. If the array could be empty, you should add a check at the beginning of the code to handle this case.\n\nAlso, this code does not guarantee that the mode will be found with the minimum precision. It will find the mode with the precision that is sufficient to satisfy the frequency requirement. If you need to find the mode with the minimum precision, you would need to use a different algorithm or method.\n\nFinally, this code uses the Map.get method to get the count of a number from the map. The Map.get method has a time complexity of O(1), so it is very efficient.\n\nIn conclusion, this code is a more efficient way to find the mode of an array with a given frequency requirement.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the array contains at least one element.
