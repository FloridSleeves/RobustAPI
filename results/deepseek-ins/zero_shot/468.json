It checks if the product's id matches the id of the product we want to delete. If it does, it removes the product from the array and returns. If it doesn't find the product, it throws a ProductNotFoundException.\n\n\nA: You can use Java 8's Stream API to achieve this in a more functional way. Here is an example:\nallProducts.removeIf(product -> product.getId() == productId);\n\nThis will remove all products from the list where the product's id equals the given productId.\n\nA: You can use Java 8's Stream API to achieve this in a more functional way.
