Let me know if you have any other questions.\n```\n```\n\nA: The DiskFileItem class is not designed to directly read the content of the file. It is designed to handle file uploads in a multipart/form-data POST request.\n\nThe getString() method you are trying to use is not part of the DiskFileItem class. Instead, you should use the InputStream returned by getInputStream() method to read the content of the file.\n\nHere is how you can modify your code:\n\n```java\nInputStream inputStream = diskFileItem.getInputStream();\nbyte[] data = new byte[(int) TEST_FILE.length()];\ninputStream.read(data);\nString content = new String(data);\nSystem.out.println(\"diskFileItem.getString() = \" + content);\n```\n\nThis code reads the content of the file into a byte array and then converts it to a String.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the file size is not too large to fit into a byte array. If the file size is too large, you may need to use a different approach to read the file content.\n\nAlso, remember to close the InputStream after you are done with it to free up system resources. You can do this by calling the close() method on the InputStream object.\n\nI hope this helps.
