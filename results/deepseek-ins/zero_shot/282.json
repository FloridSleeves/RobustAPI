When you create a Vector with a generic type, it will return the generic type as an Object. This is because Java is a statically typed language and it needs to know the type of the objects at compile time. When you use a generic type like Vector<String[]>, Java needs to know that the objects in the Vector are arrays of Strings. But it doesn't know that the arrays are specifically of length 2 (as in your case). So, it returns an Object, which can be cast to String[] to use it as a String[].\n\nA: The reason is that Vector<String[]> is a generic type.
