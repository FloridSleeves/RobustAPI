Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```java\nimport org.bouncycastle.openpgp.*;\nimport org.bouncycastle.openpgp.bc.*;\nimport org.bouncycastle.openpgp.jcajce.JcePGPPrivateKey;\nimport org.bouncycastle.openpgp.jcajce.JcePGPSecretKeyRingCollection;\nimport org.bouncycastle.openpgp.operator.bc.*;\nimport org.bouncycastle.util.io.Streams;\n\n...\n\npublic static byte[] clearSignBytes(byte[] dataBytes, PGPSecretKeyRingCollection skrCollection, String keyPass) throws PGPException {\n    ByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();\n    try {\n        // get our secret key so we can init the signature generator\n        Iterator<PGPSecretKeyRing> it = skrCollection.getKeyRings();\n        PGPSecretKeyRing skr = it.next();\n        PGPSecretKey skey = skr.getSecretKey();\n        PGPPrivateKey prKey = skey.extractPrivateKey(new BcPBESecretKeyDecryptorBuilder(new BcPGPDigestCalculatorProvider()).build(keyPass.toCharArray()));\n        BcPGPContentSignerBuilder signerBuilder = new BcPGPContentSignerBuilder(skey.getPublicKey().getAlgorithm(), PGPUtil.SHA256);\n        PGPContentSigner signer = signerBuilder.build(PGPSignature.BINARY_DOCUMENT, prKey);\n\n        // Provide the data to be signed\n        signer.update(dataBytes);\n\n        // Get the signed data and signature\n        ByteArrayOutputStream signedData = new ByteArrayOutputStream();\n        signedData.write(dataBytes);\n        signedData.write(signer.getEncoded());\n\n        return signedData.toByteArray();\n    } catch (Exception e) {\n        throw new PGPException(\"Exception while signing the data\", e);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, we first create a PGPContentSigner using the secret key and private key. We then provide the data to be signed using the `update` method of the PGPContentSigner. Finally, we get the signed data and signature by concatenating the original data with the signature using the `getEncoded` method of the PGPContentSigner.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that you have a single secret key ring in your collection. If you have multiple key rings, you will need to modify the code to handle them.\n\nAlso, please note that the `getEncoded` method of the PGPContentSigner returns the signature as a byte array, so you need to concatenate it with the original data to get the signed data.\n\nThis code uses the Bouncy Castle library, which is a powerful cryptography library that provides implementations of many cryptographic algorithms. If you haven't already, you can add it to your project by including the following dependency in your build file:\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>org.bouncycastle</groupId>\n    <artifactId>bcprov-jdk15on</artifactId>\n    <version>1.60</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n\nPlease replace the version with the latest version of Bouncy Castle library.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>"}
