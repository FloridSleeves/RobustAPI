It should be called before findViewById() because findViewById() needs a layout to work.\n\nA: You can't declare your CheckBox variables at the class level because findViewById() is a method that needs a layout to work. findViewById() needs to be called after setContentView() because it needs to find views in the layout that you've set.\nYou can move your findViewById() calls to the onCreate() method, which is called after setContentView(). Here's how you can do it:\npublic class MyClass extends Activity implements View.OnClickListener {\n    CheckBox cb1;\n    CheckBox cb2;\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n        setContentView(R.layout.my_layout);\n\n        cb1 = (CheckBox) findViewById(R.id.cb1);\n        cb2 = (CheckBox) findViewById(R.id.cb2);\n    }\n\n    public void checkboth(View view) {\n        cb1.setChecked(true);\n        cb2.setChecked(true);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onClick(View v) {\n        // Handle click events here\n    }\n}\n\nIn this code, setContentView() is called in the onCreate() method, and findViewById() is called after that.
