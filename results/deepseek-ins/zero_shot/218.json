The `read()` method is not static, so it can't be called directly on the `InputStream` class itself. Instead, you need to create an instance of `InputStream` (like `System.in`), and then call the `read()` method on that instance.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```java\nInputStream in = System.in;\nint c = in.read();\n```\n\nIn this example, `System.in` is an `InputStream` instance. We create a variable `in` of type `InputStream` and assign `System.in` to it. Then we call the `read()` method on `in`, which reads the next byte of data from the input stream.\n\nThis is different from a static method, which can be called directly on the class without creating an instance. For example, `System.out.println()` is a static method that can be called directly on the `System.out` object.\n\nSo, in summary, you can call `InputStream.read()` directly because `InputStream` is an abstract class and `read()` is a method declared in that class. You need to create an instance of `InputStream` (like `System.in`) and call the `read()` method on that instance.\n\nI hope this helps clarify things for you.
