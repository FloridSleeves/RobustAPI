This URL should not include any query parameters. When signing calls to Google services, refer to the OAuth specification, Section 9.1.2, for relevant instructions.A normalized string of the parameters in the request (excluding the oauth_signature parameter). This includes parameters sent in the request header or body, as well as query parameters added to the request URL. To normalize the string, sort the parameters using lexicographical byte value ordering. For more details on normalizing this string, see Section 9.1.1 of the OAuth specification.Generate an oauth_signature using one of the following sequences:If your application is registered and you're using HMAC-SHA1, use the OAuth \"consumer secret\" value generated during registration; this value is displayed on your domain's registration page.\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Library for generating HMAC-SHA1 OAuth signature on Android?: :Using the specifications below I need to create an oauth_signature on Android.

It takes a charset name as a parameter. If you don't specify a charset name, it defaults to the platform's default charset.\n\nCode:\nString str = \"Hello, World!\";\nbyte[] bytes = str.getBytes();\n\nExplanation: In the above code, we are creating a string \"Hello, World!\" and converting it into a sequence of bytes using the getBytes() method.\n\nQuestion: How to use String.getBytes() with a specific charset in Android?: :If you want to use a specific charset, you can pass it as a parameter to the getBytes() method. For example, if you want to use UTF-8, you can do:\n\nCode:\nString str = \"Hello, World!\";\nbyte[] bytes = str.getBytes(\"UTF-8\");\n\nExplanation: In the above code, we are creating a string \"Hello, World!\" and converting it into a sequence of bytes using the getBytes() method with \"UTF-8\" as the charset.\n\nQuestion: How to use String.getBytes() with a specific charset in Android?: :If you want to use a specific charset, you can pass it as a parameter to the getBytes() method. For example, if you want to use UTF-8, you can do:\n\nCode:\nString str = \"Hello, World!\";\nbyte[] bytes = str.getBytes(\"UTF-8\");\n\nExplanation: In the above code, we are creating a string \"Hello, World!\" and converting it into a sequence of bytes using the getBytes() method with \"UTF-8\" as the charset.\n\nQuestion: How to use String.getBytes() with a specific charset in Android?: :If you want to use a specific charset, you can pass it as a parameter to the getBytes() method.
