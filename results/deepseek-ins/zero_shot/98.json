The thread will keep polling the port until the server is up again.\n\nThe code you provided also handles the UnknownHostException exception which is thrown when the IP address of the host is unknown.\n\nHowever, you can improve the code by adding a loop that continuously tries to connect to the server. This will ensure that the thread will keep running indefinitely until the server is up again.\n\nHere is an example of how you can modify the SendToActuator function:\n\n```java\npublic boolean SendToActuator(String message) {\n    while (true) {\n        if (connected == false) {\n            disconnectedTimeout++;\n            if (disconnectedTimeout > 20) {\n                disconnectedTimeout = 0;\n                ConnectToActuator();\n            }\n        } else {\n            try {\n                out.flush();\n                out.writeBytes(message);\n                disconnectedTimeout = 0;\n                connected = true;\n                break; // Exit the loop if the message is successfully sent\n            } catch (IOException ioe) {\n                connected = false;\n                System.out.println(ioe.getMessage());\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return connected;\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, the SendToActuator function will keep trying to send the message to the server until it is successful. If the connection is lost, it will try to reconnect to the server. The loop will continue indefinitely until the server is up again.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the ConnectToActuator function is correctly implemented and it is able to establish a connection to the server.\n\nAlso, please note that the code will continue to run indefinitely until the server is up again. If you want to stop the thread, you will need to add a mechanism to do so.\n\nI hope this helps. Let me know if you have any further questions.\n\n<<<api>>>: DataOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>: out.writeBytes(message)\n<<<explanation>>>: This line of code writes the specified byte to the output stream. The byte is converted to an unsigned value before it is written.\n\n```java\npublic void writeBytes(String val) throws IOException {\n    int len = val.length();\n    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {\n        write((byte)val.charAt(i));\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code writes the string to the output stream byte by byte. It converts each character in the string to its corresponding ASCII value and writes it to the output stream.\n\nThe write method is used to write a single byte to the output stream. The byte is converted to an unsigned value before it is written.\n\nThe IOException is thrown if an I/O error occurs.\n\nThis method is synchronized to prevent multiple threads from attempting to write to the same DataOutputStream concurrently.\n\nThe writeBytes method is a part of the DataOutputStream class in Java. It is used to write a string to the output stream byte by byte.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>"}
