Convert the filename to bytes and wrap it in a ByteBuffer.\n2. Write the ByteBuffer to the channel.\n3. Flip the ByteBuffer and write it to the channel.\n4. Clear the ByteBuffer.\n5. Write the file content to the channel.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until all the file content is written.\n\nHere is the modified code:\n\n```java\nServerSocketChannel ssc = ServerSocketChannel.open();\nssc.bind(new InetSocketAddress(5002));\nSocketChannel clientchannel = ssc.accept();\n\nFile f = new File(\"C:\\\\path\\\\to\\\\your\\\\file\");\nString filename = f.getName();\nbyte[] nameinbytes = filename.getBytes(\"UTF-8\");\nByteBuffer namebuffer = ByteBuffer.wrap(nameinbytes);\n\nclientchannel.write(namebuffer);\nnamebuffer.flip();\nclientchannel.write(namebuffer);\nnamebuffer.clear();\n\ntry (FileChannel sbc = FileChannel.open(f.toPath())) {\n    ByteBuffer buff = ByteBuffer.allocate(10000000);\n    int bytesRead;\n    while ((bytesRead = sbc.read(buff)) != -1) {\n        buff.flip();\n        clientchannel.write(buff);\n        buff.clear();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nOn the client side:\n\n```java\nSocketChannel clientChannel = SocketChannel.open(new InetSocketAddress(InetAddress.getLocalHost(), 5002));\nByteBuffer bb = ByteBuffer.allocate(10000000);\nint bytesRead;\nString filename = \"\";\n\nwhile ((bytesRead = clientChannel.read(bb)) != -1) {\n    bb.flip();\n    while (bb.hasRemaining()) {\n        byte bm = bb.get();\n        char c = (char) (bm & 0xFF);\n        if (c != '?') {\n            filename += Character.toString(c);\n        } else {\n            bb.compact();\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n    bb.clear();\n}\n\nFile file = new File(\"C:\\\\Users\\\\C-I-C\\\\Desktop\\\\fromclient\\\\\" + filename);\ntry (FileOutputStream bout = new FileOutputStream(file)) {\n    FileChannel sbc = bout.getChannel();\n    ByteBuffer buff = ByteBuffer.allocate(10000000);\n    while ((bytesRead = clientChannel.read(buff)) != -1) {\n        buff.flip();\n        sbc.write(buff);\n        buff.clear();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code will send both the filename and file content using the same channel. The filename is sent first, followed by the file content. The client reads the filename from the channel, then reads the file content and writes it to a file.\n\nPlease replace `\"C:\\\\path\\\\to\\\\your\\\\file\"` with the actual path to your file.\n\nNote: The code assumes that the client is always ready to receive the file. If the client might not be ready, you should add error handling to handle situations where the client is not ready.\n\nAlso, ensure that the file path on the client side is correct and the directory exists. If the directory does not exist, you can create it using `file.mkdirs()`.\n\nLastly, remember to close the channels and sockets when you're done with them to free up resources.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n"}
