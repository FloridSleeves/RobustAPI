The parameters are the table name, the columns to return, the where clause, the where arguments, the group by, the having, and the order by. The where clause is used to filter the results. The where arguments are the values that will replace the \"?\" in the where clause. The \"%\" signs are used to create a wildcard search, so it will return any formula names that contain the query string.\n\n\nA: The error \"Failed to begin transaction\" is thrown when there is an issue with the transaction. It could be due to a variety of reasons, such as the database being locked, or the query being incorrect.\n\n*\n\n*Check if the database is locked. You can do this by calling db.isOpen() before and after the transaction. If the database is not open, it means it's locked.\n\n*Check if your query is correct. You are using a LIKE operator with a wildcard (%) at both ends of your query string. This means that it will return all the rows where the formula name starts or ends with the query string. If you want to return rows where the formula name contains the query string anywhere, you should remove the wildcards.\n\n*Ensure that the query string is not null or empty. If it is, you will get a SQLiteException when you try to execute the query.\n\n*Make sure that the database is not in a state where it cannot begin a transaction. For example, if the database is in a read-only mode, or if it is in a transaction that has not been committed.\n\n*Check if there are any other operations that could be causing the transaction to fail. For example, if you are calling db.setTransactionSuccessful() before the transaction is complete, it will throw an exception.\n\n*Ensure that you are not exceeding the maximum number of SQL statements that SQLite allows in a transaction. SQLite allows a maximum of 100 statements per transaction. If you are executing more than this, you will get an exception.\n\n*Check if there are any other operations that could be causing the transaction to fail.
