This is a known issue and has been present since Android 1.6. \n\nTo solve this, you can use the StringTokenizer class, which is designed to handle Unicode characters correctly. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```java\nString input = \"Look like this\u00a70\u00a725\";\nStringTokenizer tokenizer = new StringTokenizer(input, \"\u00a7\", true);\nList<String> dataList = new ArrayList<>();\nwhile (tokenizer.hasMoreTokens()) {\n    dataList.add(tokenizer.nextToken());\n}\nString[] data = dataList.toArray(new String[0]);\n```\n\nIn this code, we're using the StringTokenizer class to split the input string by the \"\u00a7\" character. The third parameter of the StringTokenizer constructor (true) tells it to return the delimiters along with the tokens. We then add each token to a List, and finally convert the List to an array. This should give you the expected output of a 3-long String[] with the values \"Look like this\", \"0\", and \"25\".\n\nPlease note that this solution is using the StringTokenizer class, not the String.split() method.\n\n```java\n<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer\n<<<code>>>: StringTokenizer tokenizer = new StringTokenizer(input, \"\u00a7\", true);\n<<<explanation>>>: The StringTokenizer class is used to break a string into tokens. In this case, we're breaking the string by the \"\u00a7\" character. The third parameter (true) tells the tokenizer to return the delimiters along with the tokens.\n```\n\nI hope this helps solve your issue.
