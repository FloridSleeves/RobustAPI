The command is an array of Strings where the first element is the path to the shell (\"/bin/bash\") and the second element is the \"-c\" option followed by the command we want to execute (\"ls -a\"). The ProcessBuilder.start() method starts the process and returns a Process object. We then get the InputStream from the Process object and read from it. The read method returns the number of bytes read, or -1 if the end of the stream has been reached. We use a buffer to read the data and write it to the standard output.\n\nFor the second part of your question, you can pass arguments to your script like this:\n```java\nString[] command = {\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", \"./myscript name=john age=24\"};\n```\nNote: The script must be in the same directory as your Java program or you must provide the full path to the script.\n\nPlease note that the ProcessBuilder class is available from Java 9 onwards. If you are using an older version of Java, you may need to use the Runtime.exec() method instead.\n```java\nString[] command = {\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", \"ls -a\"};\ntry {\n    Runtime rt = Runtime.getRuntime();\n    Process pr = rt.exec(command);\n\n    BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(\n                           new InputStreamReader(pr.getInputStream()));\n    String line;\n    while ((line = in.readLine()) != null) {\n        System.out.println(line);\n    }\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n```\n```java\nString[] command = {\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", \"./myscript name=john age=24\"};\ntry {\n    Runtime rt = Runtime.getRuntime();\n    Process pr = rt.exec(command);\n\n    BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(\n                           new InputStreamReader(pr.getInputStream()));\n    String line;\n    while ((line = in.readLine()) != null) {\n        System.out.println(line);\n    }\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n```\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
