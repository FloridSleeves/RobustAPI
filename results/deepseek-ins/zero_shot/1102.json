It skips the first two tokens by calling nextToken() twice. It then gets the third token (the second one we want) and again skips the next two tokens. The last token (the fourth one we want) is then retrieved and printed. This way we avoid unnecessary if checks and only process the tokens we need.\n```\n\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java line by line and write to another file?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: BufferedReader and BufferedWriter\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\ntry (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"input.txt\"));\n     BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(\"output.txt\"))) {\n    String line;\n    while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n        bw.write(line);\n        bw.newLine();\n    }\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: The code uses a try-with-resources statement to ensure that the BufferedReader and BufferedWriter are closed properly. It reads the input file line by line using the readLine() method of BufferedReader and writes each line to the output file using the write() and newLine() methods of BufferedWriter.\n```\n\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java line by line and process each line?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: BufferedReader\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\ntry (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"input.txt\"))) {\n    String line;\n    while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n        // process line\n    }\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: The code uses a try-with-resources statement to ensure that the BufferedReader is closed properly. It reads the file line by line using the readLine() method of BufferedReader and processes each line as it is read.\n```\n\nQuestion: How to write to a file in Java?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: BufferedWriter\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\ntry (BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(\"output.txt\"))) {\n    bw.write(\"Hello, World!\");\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: The code uses a try-with-resources statement to ensure that the BufferedWriter is closed properly.
