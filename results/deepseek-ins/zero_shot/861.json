In your code, you are creating a byte array of size 15 and then calling `readFully` to read 15 bytes from the file into this array. The `readFully` method will block until all the bytes are read, so it will not return until all the bytes are read.\n\nThe `readFully` method is used here because you want to read exactly 15 bytes from the file. If you use `read` instead of `readFully`, it will return after reading as many bytes as it can, which could be less than 15 if the end of the file is reached.\n\nThe `readFully` method is used here because you want to read exactly 15 bytes from the file.
