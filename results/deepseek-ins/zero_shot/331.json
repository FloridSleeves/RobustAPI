Here is an example:\n\n```java\nString[] words = {\"Hello\", \"World\"};\nString delimiter = \" \";\nString joined = Arrays.stream(words).collect(Collectors.joining(delimiter));\n```\n\nIn this code, `Arrays.stream(words)` converts the array into a Stream. The `collect(Collectors.joining(delimiter))` method then collects the elements of the stream into a single string, joining them with the specified delimiter.\n\nThis approach doesn't use `String.split()`, but it does use the `Iterator.next()` method indirectly through the `Stream` interface.\n\nNote: This solution requires Java 8 or later.\n\nA: You can use Java 8's `StringJoiner` class.\n\n```java\nString[] words = {\"Hello\", \"World\"};\nString delimiter = \" \";\nStringJoiner joiner = new StringJoiner(delimiter);\nfor (String word : words) {\n    joiner.add(word);\n}\nString joined = joiner.toString();\n```\n\nIn this code, `new StringJoiner(delimiter)` creates a `StringJoiner` with the specified delimiter. The `add(word)` method adds each word to the `StringJoiner`. Finally, `joiner.toString()` returns the joined string.\n\nThis approach doesn't use `String.split()`, but it does use the `Iterator.next()` method indirectly through the `Iterable` interface.\n\nNote: This solution requires Java 8 or later.\n\nPlease note that the `Iterator.next()` method is not used in this case.\n\nI'm asking this question because I'm looking for a way to combine an array of strings into a delimited string without using `String.split()`.\n\n\nA: You can use Java 8's `StringJoiner` class.\n\n```java\nString[] words = {\"Hello\", \"World\"};\nString delimiter = \" \";\nStringJoiner joiner = new StringJoiner(delimiter);\nfor (String word : words) {\n    joiner.add(word);\n}\nString joined = joiner.toString();\n```\n\nIn this code, `new StringJoiner(delimiter)` creates a `StringJoiner` with the specified delimiter.
