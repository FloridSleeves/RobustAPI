It first gets the set of all window handles using `driver.getWindowHandles()`. Then it iterates over this set and gets the IDs of all windows. The parent window is saved in `parentWindow` variable. Then it checks if the parent window ID is not equal to the child window ID. If it's not equal, it switches the focus to the child window. If it is equal, it gets the ID of the next window and switches the focus to it.\n\nNote: This code assumes that there are at least two windows open. If there is only one window, it will throw an exception.\n\nAlso, this code does not handle the case when there are more than two windows. If you need to handle that, you would need to add more logic to the iterator.\n\nThis code is using the `switchTo().window(String windowHandle)` method of the `WebDriver` interface, which switches the focus to a window with the given window handle.\n\nThis code should be placed in the location where you want to switch to the new window.\n\nPlease replace `driver` with your actual WebDriver instance.\n\nThis code is using Java language.\n\nThis code is using Selenium WebDriver API.\n\nThis code is using Selenium WebDriver API to switch between windows in a browser.\n\nThis code is using Selenium WebDriver API to switch between windows in a browser.
