The first call is to skip the word, and the second call is to get the count. Instead, you should call nextToken() only once in your while loop, and then call nextToken() twice: once to get the count, and once to skip the word. Here is the corrected code:\n\n```java\npublic static class TokenizerMapper extends Mapper<Object, Text, IntWritable, IntWritable> {\n    private final static IntWritable one = new IntWritable(1);\n\n    public void map(Object key, Text value, Context context) throws IOException, InterruptedException {\n        StringTokenizer itr = new StringTokenizer(value.toString());\n        itr.nextToken(); // Skip over first line, which has just one element\n        while (itr.hasMoreTokens()) {\n            itr.nextToken(); // Skip over word\n            IntWritable count = new IntWritable(Integer.parseInt(itr.nextToken())); // save count as key\n            context.write(count, one);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code will correctly skip the word and save the count as the key for your MapReduce job.\n\nExplanation: The StringTokenizer class in Java is used to break a string into tokens. In your code, you are using it to break the input text into tokens. The nextToken() method is used to get the next token from the string. When you call nextToken() twice in your while loop, you are trying to get the next token twice, which is causing the NoSuchElementException. By calling nextToken() only once in your while loop, you are ensuring that you are getting the next token only once for each iteration of your loop.\n\nNote: The code assumes that the count is always an integer. If the count can be a non-integer, you will need to handle that case.\n\nAlso, the output key is now an IntWritable instead of a Text, because you want to use the count as the key in your MapReduce job.\n\nI hope this helps.
