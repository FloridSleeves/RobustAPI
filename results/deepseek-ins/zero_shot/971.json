Lets say a command called \"add hello\", so that it will create a new textfile and add the word \"hello\" to it. Then i want to test a function called getAllLines which returns \"hello\" and compare it with assert.My main problem is how to simulate user input to console via junit test. This is what i tried but its not working..private void performUserInput(String strInput){    ByteArrayInputStream in = new ByteArrayInputStream(strInput.getBytes());    System.setIn(in);}private void releaseUserInputToSystem(){    System.setIn(System.in);;}@Testpublic void testSearchingInEmptyFile() {    TextBuddy textBuddy = new TextBuddy(\"file.txt\");    textBuddy.run();    performUserInput(\"add little brown fox\");    releaseUserInputToSystem();    assertEquals(\"little brown foxx\", \"asd\");}It seems to me like the code never reaches assert.edit----------------------------------------------After debugging, its getting stuck hereprivate String[] getCommandAndArgs(){    String[] splitCommand = scanner.nextLine().split(\" \"); //<<STUCK HERE    printNewLine();    return splitCommand;}\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Giving input for JUnit test: :Hi this is the first time im trying out unit testing in java using eclipse.So when i test my class, it requires user input.

Then, you run your program with textBuddy.run(). After that, you can compare the output of your program with the expected result. Finally, you release the simulated user input back to the system by calling releaseUserInputToSystem().\n\nQuestion: What is the problem with the code?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: getCommandAndArgs()\n<<<code>>>: String[] splitCommand = scanner.nextLine().split(\" \");\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that scanner.nextLine() is waiting for user input, but there is no input provided in the test. This is why the test is getting stuck. To fix this, you need to provide user input before calling getCommandAndArgs().\n\nQuestion: How to provide user input in JUnit test?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: performUserInput()\n<<<code>>>: performUserInput(\"add little brown fox\");\n<<<explanation>>>: This method simulates user input by replacing the standard input stream with a new input stream that reads from the given string. You can use it before calling getCommandAndArgs() to provide user input.\n\nQuestion: How to compare the output of your program with the expected result in JUnit test?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: assertEquals()\n<<<code>>>: assertEquals(\"expected result\", \"actual result\");\n<<<explanation>>>: This method compares the actual result of your program with the expected result. If they are equal, the test passes. If they are not equal, the test fails. You can use it after calling getCommandAndArgs() to compare the output of your program with the expected result.\n\nQuestion: How to restore the original standard input stream after the test?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: releaseUserInputToSystem()\n<<<code>>>: releaseUserInputToSystem();\n<<<explanation>>>: This method restores the standard input stream to its original state. After the test, you should call this method to restore the original standard input stream.\n\nQuestion: How to use these methods in a JUnit test?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: performUserInput(), releaseUserInputToSystem()\n<<<code>>>: \n```\nperformUserInput(\"add little brown fox\");\ntextBuddy.run();\nassertEquals(\"little brown fox\", textBuddy.getAllLines());\nreleaseUserInputToSystem();\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: First, you simulate user input by calling performUserInput() with the string you want to simulate.
