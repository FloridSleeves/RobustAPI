And I need to get the element at index 2. How would I do this if there's no get method and iterator doesn't track indexes? \nPlease using this api: List.get.\nAnswer: $CODE: list.get(2);\n$EXPLANATION: The get method of the List interface in Java takes an integer index as an argument and returns the element at that index. In this case, we're getting the third element of the list.\n\nA: If you don't have a get method, you can use the ListIterator. Here is an example:\n\n<<<code>>>:\nListIterator<String> iterator = list.listIterator();\nfor (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\n    iterator.next();\n}\nString thirdElement = iterator.previous();\n\n<<<explanation>>>:\nIn this code, we create a ListIterator from the list. We then use a for loop to advance the iterator to the third position (index 2). After the loop, the iterator is at the third position, so we call previous() to get the element at that position.\n\nPlease note that this method will throw an exception if the index is out of range. You should always check the size of the list before trying to access an element at a certain index.\n\nA: If you don't have a get method, you can use the ListIterator. Here is an example:\n\n<<<code>>>:\nListIterator<String> iterator = list.listIterator();\nfor (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {\n    iterator.next();\n}\nString thirdElement = iterator.next();\n\n<<<explanation>>>:\nIn this code, we create a ListIterator from the list.
