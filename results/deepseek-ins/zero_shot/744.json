This method does not add a newline character after the text you are appending. Therefore, when you call `write.append(\"String\\r\\n\");`, it adds \"String\" to the file and then adds the newline character, but then it continues to add the arguments of the inner object right after \"String\", without a newline character in between.\n\nTo fix this, you should use the `PrintWriter.println()` method instead of `PrintWriter.append()`. The `println()` method automatically adds a newline character after the text you are printing.\n\nHere is how you can modify your code:\n\n```java\npublic void writer1(String file) {\n    File path = new File(\"../Opdracht6_2/src/\" + file);\n    try {\n        PrintWriter write = new PrintWriter(new FileOutputStream(path, true));\n        write.println(\"String\"); // Use println instead of append\n        this.innerobject.innerwriter();\n        write.println(this objects arg); // Use println instead of append\n        write.close();\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis should ensure that the \"String\" is printed before the inner object's arguments, and that each is printed on a new line.\n\nNote: Replace `this objects arg` with the actual variable or expression that represents the arguments of the current object.\n\nAlso, make sure to replace `innerobjects arg` with the actual variable or expression that represents the arguments of the inner object.\n\nI hope this helps to solve your issue.
