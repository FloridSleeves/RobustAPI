It is a part of java.util package. The StringTokenizer class has two constructors. The first constructor takes a string and a delimiter. The second constructor takes a string and delimiters and a boolean flag. The delimiter is used to determine where the string should be broken. The boolean flag is used to specify whether the delimiter should be ignored or not.\nIn the given code, we are using the first constructor of StringTokenizer. We are reading a line from the BufferedReader and passing it to the StringTokenizer. The StringTokenizer breaks the string into tokens using the space as the delimiter. The first token is converted to an integer and stored in the variable x. The next token is stored in the variable y.\nThe code then prints the value of x and y.\n```\n\nA: Yes, you're correct.
