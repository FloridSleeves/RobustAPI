BufferedReader is used to read the file line by line. It is more efficient than using FileInputStream for reading large files.\n\nQuestion: How to read a file from internal storage in Android?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: getFilesDir()\n<<<code>>>: File file = new File(getFilesDir(), \"filename\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The getFilesDir() method returns the absolute path to the directory where you should place your app's files. This directory is internal to your application and can only be accessed by your application.\n\nQuestion: How to read a file from external storage in Android?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: getExternalFilesDir()\n<<<code>>>: File file = new File(getExternalFilesDir(null), \"filename\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The getExternalFilesDir() method returns the absolute path to the directory where you should place your app's files. This directory is internal to your application and can only be accessed by your application. If external storage is not available, it returns null.\n\nQuestion: How to write a file to external storage in Android?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: getExternalFilesDir()\n<<<code>>>: File file = new File(getExternalFilesDir(null), \"filename\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The getExternalFilesDir() method returns the absolute path to the directory where you should place your app's files. This directory is internal to your application and can only be accessed by your application. If external storage is not available, it returns null.\n\nQuestion: How to check if external storage is available and writable in Android?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Environment.getExternalStorageState()\n<<<code>>>: String state = Environment.getExternalStorageState();\nif (Environment.MEDIA_MOUNTED.equals(state)) {\n    // Can read and write the media.\n} else if (Environment.MEDIA_MOUNTED_READ_ONLY.equals(state)) {\n    // Can only read the media.\n} else {\n    // No external storage.\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The getExternalStorageState() method returns the current state of the primary external storage.
