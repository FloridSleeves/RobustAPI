If the JRE is 32bit, it will read 4 bytes (32 bits) at a time, and if the JRE is 64bit, it will read 8 bytes (64 bits) at a time. This is because the JRE will allocate 4 bytes for the header of each object, and 8 bytes for the header of a long. If the JRE is 32bit, the headers will be smaller, and if the JRE is 64bit, the headers will be larger.\nHowever, this method is not reliable if the JRE is corrupted or if the system is out of memory. It's also not reliable if the JRE is running in a virtual machine.\n\nA: You can use the System.getProperty(\"os.arch\") method to get the architecture of the operating system. If the result is \"amd64\" or \"x86_64\", then it's a 64-bit operating system. If the result is \"x86\" or \"i386\", then it's a 32-bit operating system.\n\nA: You can use the System.getProperty(\"sun.arch.data.model\") method to get the data model of the JVM. If the result is \"64\", then it's a 64-bit JVM. If the result is \"32\", then it's a 32-bit JVM.\n\nA: You can use the System.getProperty(\"os.arch\") method to get the architecture of the operating system. If the result is \"amd64\" or \"x86_64\", then it's a 64-bit operating system. If the result is \"x86\" or \"i386\", then it's a 32-bit operating system.\n\nA: You can use the System.getProperty(\"java.class.version\") method to get the class version of the JVM. If the result is \"50.0\", then it's a 64-bit JVM. If the result is \"49.0\", then it's a 32-bit JVM.\n\nA: You can use the System.getProperty(\"java.vm.specification.version\") method to get the specification version of the JVM. If the result is \"1.8\", then it's a 64-bit JVM. If the result is \"1.7\", then it's a 32-bit JVM.\n\nA: You can use the System.getProperty(\"java.vm.version\") method to get the version of the JVM. If the result is \"1.8.0_111\", then it's a 64-bit JVM. If the result is \"25.111-b14\", then it's a 32-bit JVM.\n\nA: You can use the System.getProperty(\"java.vm.vendor\") method to get the vendor of the JVM. If the result is \"Oracle Corporation\", then it's a 64-bit JVM. If the result is \"Sun Microsystems Inc.\", then it's a 32-bit JVM.\n\nA: You can use the System.getProperty(\"java.vm.name\") method to get the name of the JVM. If the result is \"Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM\", then it's a 64-bit JVM. If the result is \"Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM\", then it's a 32-bit JVM.\n\nA: You can use the System.getProperty(\"java.runtime.version\") method to get the version of the JVM. If the result is \"1.8.0_111\", then it's a 64-bit JVM. If the result is \"25"}
