However, you can keep track of the number of bytes written yourself by keeping a counter.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```java\nbyte[] data = ... // your data\nDataOutputStream out = new DataOutputStream(client.getOutputStream());\nint totalBytesWritten = 0;\nwhile (totalBytesWritten < data.length) {\n    int bytesWritten = out.write(data, totalBytesWritten, data.length - totalBytesWritten);\n    totalBytesWritten += bytesWritten;\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `out.write(data, totalBytesWritten, data.length - totalBytesWritten)` will write a chunk of data to the output stream. The number of bytes written is returned and you can add it to `totalBytesWritten`. This will continue until all data has been written.\n\nPlease note that this will not work if the underlying output stream throws an IOException. You would need to handle that case in your code.\n\nThis approach will work for your resume functionality as well. You can keep track of the number of bytes written and resume from there.\n\nNote: This approach assumes that the number of bytes written by `DataOutputStream.write(byte[] b)` is the same as the number of bytes written by `DataOutputStream.write(int i)`. This is not always the case, but in practice it is.\n\nPlease note that this approach does not work if the underlying output stream throws an IOException. You would need to handle that case in your code.\n\nThis approach will work for your resume functionality as well. You can keep track of the number of bytes written and resume from there.\n\nNote: This approach assumes that the number of bytes written by `DataOutputStream.write(byte[] b)` is the same as the number of bytes written by `DataOutputStream.write(int i)`. This is not always the case, but in practice it is.\n\nPlease note that this approach does not work if the underlying output stream throws an IOException.
