The \u00d0 and \u00cf are not valid single-byte characters in Java, so they're being interpreted as the start of a multi-byte character sequence.\nInstead of treating the file as bytes, you should treat it as characters. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```java\nInputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream(\"D:\\\\Users\\\\Vinoth\\\\workspace\\\\Testing\\\\Testing_2.doc\"), \"UTF-8\");\nOutputStreamWriter osw = new OutputStreamWriter(new FileOutputStream(\"D:\\\\Users\\\\Vinoth\\\\workspace\\\\Testing\\\\Testing_3.doc\"), \"UTF-8\");\n\nchar[] buff = new char[1024];\nint len;\nboolean start = false;\nwhile ((len = isr.read(buff)) != -1) {\n    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {\n        char c = buff[i];\n        if (c == '\u00d0' && i + 1 < len && buff[i + 1] == '\u00cf') {\n            start = true;\n            i++; // skip the next character\n        }\n        if (start) {\n            osw.write(c);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nisr.close();\nosw.close();\n```\n\nThis code reads the file as characters using an InputStreamReader, which can handle different character encodings. It then writes the characters to the output file using an OutputStreamWriter. The `start` variable is used to determine whether the special sequence '\u00d0\u00cf' has been encountered. If it has, the character is written to the output file; otherwise, it is skipped.\n\nNote that the `read` method returns the number of characters read, not the number of bytes. This is why we use a char[] array instead of a byte[] array.\n\nAlso, make sure to close the InputStreamReader and OutputStreamWriter after you're done with them to free up system resources.\n\nThis should solve your problem.\n\n\nA: The problem is that you are treating the file as a byte stream, but the \u00d0 and \u00cf characters are not valid single-byte characters in Java. They are part of a two-byte character sequence.\nYou should read the file as a character stream instead. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```java\nReader reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream(\"D:\\\\Users\\\\Vinoth\\\\workspace\\\\Testing\\\\Testing_2.doc\"), \"UTF-8\");\nWriter writer = new OutputStreamWriter(new FileOutputStream(\"D:\\\\Users\\\\Vinoth\\\\workspace\\\\Testing\\\\Testing_3.doc\"), \"UTF-8\");\n\nchar[] buff = new char[1024];\nint len;\nboolean start = false;\nwhile ((len = reader.read(buff)) != -1) {\n    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {\n        char c = buff[i];\n        if (c == '\u00d0' && i + 1 < len && buff[i + 1] == '\u00cf') {\n            start = true;\n            i++; // skip the next character\n        }\n        if (start) {\n            writer.write(c);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nreader.close();\nwriter.close();\n```\n\nThis code reads the file as characters using an InputStreamReader, which can handle different character encodings.
