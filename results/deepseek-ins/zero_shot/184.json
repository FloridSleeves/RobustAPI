Why?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: int read()\n<<<explanation>>>: This method reads the next byte of data from the input stream. The value byte is returned as an int in the range 0 to 255. If no byte is available because the end of the stream has been reached, the value -1 is returned. In case of an I/O error the exception is thrown.\n\nThe byte -1 is represented in Java as 0xFF in an unsigned context and 0xFFFFFFFF in a signed context. So when you add -1 + 1 + 0, you get 256 because 0xFF + 1 + 0 equals 256.\n\nHere is the code:\nbyte[] bytes = new byte[] { -1, 1, 0x0 };\nInputStream in = new ByteArrayInputStream(bytes);\nSystem.out.println(in.read() + in.read() + in.read()); // prints 256\n\nThe first read() call returns 0xFF (255), because -1 is represented as 0xFF in an unsigned context. The second read() call returns 1, and the third read() call returns 0. When you add these three numbers together, you get 256.\n\nSo, the behavior you're seeing is due to the way Java represents negative numbers in unsigned contexts.\n\nP.S. The first statement returns 255. Why? Because -1 is represented as 0xFF in an unsigned context.\n\nP.S.S. The behavior you're seeing is not specific to ByteArrayInputStream.
