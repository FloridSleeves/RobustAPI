This is done in a loop that runs k times. This way, we remove k elements from the map without iterating through the entire map.\n\n\nA: You can't remove elements from a Map while iterating over it, because the Map doesn't support this operation. The Iterator.remove() method is designed to remove elements from a Collection, not a Map.\nIf you want to remove k elements from a Map, you have to iterate over it at least once, and you can't avoid that.\nIf you want to remove a random subset of elements, you can convert the Map to a List, shuffle the list, and then remove the first k elements.\nList<Map.Entry<K,V>> list = new ArrayList<>(map.entrySet());\nCollections.shuffle(list);\nfor (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {\n    list.remove(0);\n}\n\nThis will remove k random elements from the map.\n\nA: You can't remove elements from a Map while iterating over it because the Map doesn't support this operation.
