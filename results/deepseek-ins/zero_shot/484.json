If this does not make a difference point it out though.I am not interested in the value per se, only the indices.My question is whether there is a faster approach to go with it?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: Yes, there is a faster approach to go with it. You can use a PriorityQueue instead of sorting the array and then retrieving the indices from the map. The PriorityQueue will automatically sort the elements as you add them, and you can retrieve the indices of the top-k elements in O(k log k) time. Here is an example of how you can implement this:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.PriorityQueue;\nimport java.util.Comparator;\n\n// Create a PriorityQueue with a custom comparator that compares the double values\nPriorityQueue<int[]> queue = new PriorityQueue<>(new Comparator<int[]>() {\n    public int compare(int[] a, int[] b) {\n        return Double.compare(b[0], a[0]);\n    }\n});\n\n// Add the double values and their indices to the PriorityQueue\nfor (int i = 0; i < numClusters; i++) {\n    queue.offer(new int[]{scores[i], i});\n}\n\n// Retrieve the indices of the top-k elements\nHashSet<Integer> topPossibleClusters = new HashSet<>();\nfor (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {\n    topPossibleClusters.add(queue.poll()[1]);\n}\n```\n\nThis approach will be faster than sorting the array and retrieving the indices from the map, especially for large arrays.\n\nNote: The PriorityQueue in Java uses a min-heap, so the element with the highest double value will be at the top of the queue. We use a custom comparator to reverse this order, so the element with the lowest double value will be at the top of the queue.\n\nThis approach uses O(n log k) time, where n is the number of elements in the array. This is faster than the previous approach that used O(n log n) time.\n\nPlease note that the PriorityQueue approach will not maintain the original order of the elements in the array. If you need to maintain the original order, you will need to use a different data structure.\n\nAlso, please note that the PriorityQueue approach will not work correctly if you need to retrieve the indices of the top-k elements in descending order. In that case, you will need to use a min-heap instead of a max-heap.\n\nI hope this helps, and let me know if you have any other questions.\n\n<<<api>>>: PriorityQueue\n<<<code>>>: PriorityQueue<int[]> queue = new PriorityQueue<>(new Comparator<int[]>() {...});\n<<<explanation>>>: PriorityQueue is a class in Java that implements the Queue interface. It is a specialized container that sorts its elements according to their natural ordering or a custom Comparator. In this case, we are using a custom Comparator to sort the elements in descending order based on their double values.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>"}
