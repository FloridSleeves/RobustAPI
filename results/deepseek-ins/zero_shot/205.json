This means that the second CipherInputStream will not have any data to decrypt. To fix this, you need to wrap the CipherInputStream in a BufferedInputStream, which will buffer the data and allow it to be read multiple times. Here is the corrected code:\n\n```java\nInputStream payload = new ByteArrayInputStream(payloadArray);\nCipher encryptCipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES\", \"SunJCE\");\nencryptCipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key, IV);\nInputStream encryptStream = new CipherInputStream(payload, encryptCipher);\nCipher decryptCipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES\", \"SunJCE\");\ndecryptCipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, key, IV);\nInputStream decryptStream = new BufferedInputStream(new CipherInputStream(encryptStream, decryptCipher));\nbyte[] plainText = IOUtils.toByteArray(decryptStream);\n```\n\nThis should allow you to read the decrypted data correctly.\n\nNote: The `IOUtils.toByteArray` method is used to convert the InputStream to a byte array. If you are using a different method to read the InputStream, you may need to adjust the code accordingly.\n\nAlso, ensure that the `payloadArray` is not null and contains the expected data. If the data is null or empty, the `ByteArrayInputStream` will also be empty, and the decryption will also result in an empty stream.\n\nLastly, ensure that the `key` and `IV` are correctly initialized and match the encryption key and initialization vector used. If they are not correctly initialized, the decryption will fail.\n\nI hope this helps resolve your issue. If you have any further questions, feel free to ask.\n\nAnswer: The problem is that the CipherInputStream reads from the underlying input stream and then closes it.
