These are then cast to Long before being added together.\n\nA: You can cast the result of get() method to Long and then call longValue() method. Here is how you can do it:\nlong total = ((Long) currentRowContents.get(\"value_A\")).longValue() + ((Long) currentRowContents.get(\"value_B\")).longValue();\n\nThis will work because get() method returns an Object, and you are casting it to Long before calling longValue() method.\n\nA: You can cast the result of get() method to Long and then call longValue() method.
