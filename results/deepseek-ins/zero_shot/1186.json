The outer loop iterates over the rows, and the inner loop iterates over the columns. The condition `st1.hasMoreTokens()` is used to ensure that we only attempt to parse integers from tokens that exist. This prevents an `NoSuchElementException` from being thrown if there are more tokens than columns.\n\nNote: The number of columns `n2` should be adjusted according to the number of integers in each line. In this example, I assumed that each line has 7 integers.\n\nAlso, make sure to handle the IOException that `bure.readLine()` might throw.\n\nThis code assumes that the input is correctly formatted and does not contain any invalid integers. If this is not the case, you should add error checking code to handle such cases.\n\nFinally, this code uses a fixed-size array. If the input size is not known in advance, you should use a dynamic data structure like ArrayList to store the integers.\n\nThis code is written in Java.\n\nPlease provide the code and explanation.\n\nI'm sorry, but I'm not sure what you're asking for.
