We've been happily doing this for quite some time and everything is working fine, except that now I need to access the SOAP header in the response and I just can't find a way to do this. We are using a WebServiceTemplate (from springs-ws) configured with a Jaxb2Marshaller. The jaxb files are generated from the wsdl using xjc. The header element in my responses look something like this:   <soapenv:Header>         <v1:ResponseHeader status=\"OK\">             <v1:description>test</v1:description>          </v1:ResponseHeader>   </soapenv:Header>In my java class, the code that parses the response looks like this (I've stripped some irrelevant code):public CalculationData getValues(Integer id) throws IntegrationException {    WebServiceMessageCallback callback = createCallback(soapAction);    GetValuesRequest request = toGetValues(id);    GetValuesResponse response = null;    try {        response = (GetValuesResponse) webServiceTemplate.marshalSendAndReceive(request,         callback);    } catch (SOAPFaultException fault) {        log.error(\"Soap fault occurred during getValues \" + id);        throw new IntegrationException(fault);    }    CalculationData data = fromGetValues(response);    return data;}Please help me find a solution for extracting the information from the SOAP header out of the response.

However, I only expect to get one element in the soap header anyhow, is this will work fine.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: $CODE:\n```java\nSoapHeaderElement header = null;\nIterator<SoapHeaderElement> responseHeaderElements = message.getSoapHeader().examineAllHeaderElements();\nif (responseHeaderElements.hasNext()) {\n    header = responseHeaderElements.next();\n} else {\n    log.error(\"Error: No ResponseHeader found in response.\");\n    return false;\n}\nString responseCode = header.getAttributeValue(new QName(STATUS_QNAME));\nresponseMsg.put(RESPONSE_MSG_KEY, responseCode);\nreturn true;\n```\n$EXPLANATION:\nThis code snippet is used to extract the SOAP header from the response. The `examineAllHeaderElements()` method is used to get an iterator over all the header elements in the SOAP message. The first element is retrieved using `Iterator.next()` and stored in the `header` variable. The `getAttributeValue()` method is then used to get the value of the 'status' attribute from the `ResponseHeader` element. The value is then stored in the `responseMsg` map with the key `RESPONSE_MSG_KEY`. The method returns `true` if the header was successfully extracted and parsed, `false` otherwise.\n\nPlease replace `STATUS_QNAME` and `RESPONSE_MSG_KEY` with your actual QName and key.\n\nNote: The `examineAllHeaderElements()` method is deprecated in Spring WS 2.2 and it's recommended to use `getHeaderElements()` instead. The `getHeaderElements()` method returns a List of SoapHeaderElement, so you can directly access the first element using `get(0)`.\n\n```java\nList<SoapHeaderElement> headerElements = message.getSoapHeader().getHeaderElements();\nif (!headerElements.isEmpty()) {\n    SoapHeaderElement header = headerElements.get(0);\n    String responseCode = header.getAttributeValue(new QName(STATUS_QNAME));\n    responseMsg.put(RESPONSE_MSG_KEY, responseCode);\n    return true;\n} else {\n    log.error(\"Error: No ResponseHeader found in response.\");\n    return false;\n}\n```\nThis code will work in the same way as the previous one, but it's more straightforward and recommended by Spring WS team.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>"}
