This method writes the argument as a 4-byte quantity to the underlying output stream in big-endian byte order.\n\n<<<api>>>: DataOutputStream.writeInt\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nDataOutputStream out = new DataOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(\"archive.dat\"));\nint numberOfFiles = 5;\nout.writeInt(numberOfFiles);\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: The writeInt method writes the integer numberOfFiles to the DataOutputStream in big-endian byte order. This means that the least significant byte is written first, followed by the next most significant byte, and so on, up to the most significant byte. This is the standard way to represent integers in big-endian format.\n\nTo expand an integer to fit/exand to a given number of bytes, you can use the writeInt method multiple times, once for each byte you want to write. For example, if you want to write an integer to a byte array that can fit in 2 bytes, you can write the integer as follows:\n\n```java\nbyte[] bytes = new byte[2];\nbytes[0] = (byte) (numberOfFiles >> 8);\nbytes[1] = (byte) (numberOfFiles & 0xFF);\n```\n\nThis code first shifts the numberOfFiles 8 bits to the right, which gives you the most significant byte, and then writes this byte to the first index of the byte array. It then writes the least significant byte of numberOfFiles to the second index of the byte array. The least significant byte is obtained by performing a bitwise AND operation with 0xFF, which ensures that the least significant 8 bits of numberOfFiles are written.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the numberOfFiles is a positive integer. If numberOfFiles can be negative, you should use the unsigned right shift operator (>>>) instead of the signed right shift operator (>>).\n\nAlso, this code assumes that you want to write the integer to a byte array. If you want to write the integer to a file, you can use the write method of the DataOutputStream class instead of the write method of the byte array.\n\n```java\nout.write(bytes);\n```\n\nThis code writes the byte array to the DataOutputStream, which writes the bytes to the underlying output stream.\n\nI hope this helps.
