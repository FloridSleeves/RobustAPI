For example, it is not generally permissible for one thread to modify a Collection while another thread is iterating over it. In general, the results of the iteration are undefined under these circumstances.\n\nThe error is happening because you are trying to modify a HashMap while you are iterating over it using an Iterator. The Iterator.next() method does not allow modifications to the underlying collection.\n\nTo fix this, you should not modify the HashMap while iterating over it. If you need to modify the HashMap, you should create a copy of it and then iterate over the copy.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```java\nHashMap<String, String> map = new HashMap<String, String>();\n// populate map\n\nIterator<Map.Entry<String, String>> it = map.entrySet().iterator();\nwhile (it.hasNext()) {\n    Map.Entry<String, String> entry = it.next();\n    // do something with entry\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, you are not modifying the HashMap while iterating over it. If you need to modify the HashMap, you should create a copy of it and then iterate over the copy.\n\nThis is a common issue in Java and it's a good practice to avoid it.\n\nNote: This exception does not always indicate that an object has been concurrently modified by a different thread. If a single thread issues a sequence of method invocations that violates the contract of an object, the object may throw this exception. For example, if a thread modifies a collection directly while it is iterating over the collection with a fail-fast iterator, the iterator will throw this exception.\n\nThis exception may be thrown by methods that have detected concurrent modification of an object when such modification is not permissible.\n\nFor example, it is not generally permissible for one thread to modify a Collection while another thread is iterating over it. In general, the results of the iteration are undefined under these circumstances.\n\nTake care that if you are using a fail-fast iterator, you must not modify the collection directly while it is iterating.\n\nIn general, the results of the iteration are undefined under these circumstances.\n\nNote: This exception does not always indicate that an object has been concurrently modified by a different thread.
