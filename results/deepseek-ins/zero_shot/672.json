Please help!\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: Yes, it is possible to create a file if it doesn't exist. You can use the File class's createNewFile() method to create a new file. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```java\n// Write highscores to highscores.txt\nFile save = new File(\"highscores.txt\");\nif (!save.exists()) {\n    save.createNewFile();\n}\ntry {\n    PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"highscores.txt\", \"UTF-8\");\n    writer.println(String.valueOf(Highscores.highscore1));\n    writer.println(String.valueOf(Highscores.highscore2));\n    writer.println(String.valueOf(Highscores.highscore3));\n    writer.close();\n} catch (Exception e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n\n// Read highscores from highscores.txt\nBufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"highscores.txt\"));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = in.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\nin.close();\n```\n\nThis code will create a new file named \"highscores.txt\" if it doesn't exist. Then it writes the high scores to the file and reads them back.\n\nNote: Always remember to handle exceptions properly in your code. The code above is a simple example and doesn't handle all possible exceptions. In a real-world application, you should handle the exceptions properly to prevent your program from crashing.\n\nAlso, make sure that the file path is correct and the file is accessible from the location where your program is running.\n\nLastly, remember to close the PrintWriter and BufferedReader after you're done with them to free up system resources.\n\nI hope this helps you. Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\nAnswer: Yes, it is possible to create a file if it doesn't exist. You can use the File class's createNewFile() method to create a new file.
