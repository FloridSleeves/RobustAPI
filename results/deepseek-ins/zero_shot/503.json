This is necessary because if you try to remove elements from the ArrayList directly while iterating over it, it will throw a ConcurrentModificationException.\n\nA: You can use an Iterator to remove elements from a collection while iterating over it.\nHere is an example:\nIterator<Pixel> iterator = pixel.iterator();\nwhile(iterator.hasNext()){\n    Pixel px = iterator.next();\n    if(px.y > gHeight){\n        iterator.remove();\n    }\n}\n\nIn this code, the iterator.remove() method removes the last element returned by the iterator's next() method from the underlying collection.\n\nA: You can use an Iterator to remove elements from a collection while iterating over it.\nHere is an example:\nIterator<Pixel> iterator = pixel.iterator();\nwhile(iterator.hasNext()){\n    Pixel px = iterator.next();\n    if(px.y > gHeight){\n        iterator.remove();\n    }\n}\n\nIn this code, the iterator.remove() method removes the last element returned by the iterator's next() method from the underlying collection.\n\nA: You can use an Iterator to remove elements from a collection while iterating over it.\nHere is an example:\nIterator<Pixel> iterator = pixel.iterator();\nwhile(iterator.hasNext()){\n    Pixel px = iterator.next();\n    if(px.y > gHeight){\n        iterator.remove();\n    }\n}\n\nIn this code, the iterator.remove() method removes the last element returned by the iterator's next() method from the underlying collection.\n\nA: You can use Iterator's remove method to remove elements from the ArrayList while iterating over it.\nHere is an example:\nIterator<Pixel> iterator = pixel.iterator();\nwhile(iterator.hasNext()){\n    Pixel px = iterator.next();\n    if(px.y > gHeight){\n        iterator.remove();\n    }\n}\n\nIn this code, the iterator.remove() method removes the last element returned by the iterator's next() method from the underlying collection.\n\nA: You can use Iterator's remove() method to remove elements from the ArrayList while iterating over it.\nHere is an example:\nIterator<Pixel> iterator = pixel.iterator();\nwhile(iterator.hasNext()){\n    Pixel px = iterator.next();\n    if(px.y > gHeight){\n        iterator.remove();\n    }\n}\n\nIn this code, the iterator.remove() method removes the last element returned by the iterator's next() method from the underlying collection.\n\nA: You can use Iterator's remove() method to remove elements from the ArrayList while iterating over it.\nHere is an example:\nIterator<Pixel> iterator = pixel.iterator();\nwhile(iterator.hasNext()){\n    Pixel px = iterator.next();\n    if(px.y > gHeight){\n        iterator.remove();\n    }\n}\n\nIn this code, the iterator.remove() method removes the last element returned by the iterator's next() method from the underlying collection.\n\nA: You can use Iterator's remove() method to remove elements from the ArrayList while iterating over it.\nHere is an example:\nIterator<Pixel> iterator = pixel.iterator();\nwhile(iterator.hasNext()){\n    Pixel px = iterator.next();\n    if(px.y > gHeight){\n        iterator.remove();\n    }\n}\n\nIn this code, the iterator.remove() method removes the last element returned by the iterator's next() method from the underlying collection.\n\nA: You can use Iterator's remove() method to remove elements from the ArrayList while iterating over it.\nHere is an example:"}
