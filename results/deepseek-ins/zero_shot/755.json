The client stores the properties into the output stream.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the properties are stored in a single line. If the properties are stored in multiple lines, you will need to modify the solution to read the properties line by line.\n\nAlso, this solution does not handle any exceptions that may occur during the reading or writing of the properties. You should add appropriate error handling code to handle these exceptions.\n\nThis solution also assumes that the properties are stored in a format that can be read by the Properties class. If the properties are stored in a different format, you will need to modify the solution to use the appropriate method to load the properties.\n\nFinally, this solution does not handle any communication errors. You should add appropriate error handling code to handle these errors.\n\nI hope this helps.
