The tokens are separated by the comma. We then use the nextToken() method to get the tokens and trim() to remove any leading or trailing whitespace. The mass is parsed as a double using Double.parseDouble().\n\nNote: StringTokenizer is a legacy class and it is recommended to use the Scanner class for new code.\n```\nI'm having trouble with my scanner when it's reading a file. It's suppose to make a new token when there's a comma followed by a space or when a new line is created, but after the 4 tokens, it throws the NoSuchElementException.\n\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Scanner\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\ntry (Scanner sc = new Scanner(new FileReader(filePath))) {\n    sc.useDelimiter(Pattern.compile(\"(, ) | (\\r\\n)\"));\n    sc.useLocale(Locale.US);\n    while(sc.hasNext()) {\n        String name = sc.next();\n        double mass = sc.nextDouble();\n        elementMap.put(name, mass);\n    }\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n    JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(self, \"Error loading ElementMasses file.\", \"IOException\", JOptionPane.ERROR_MESSAGE);\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: In this code, we use a Scanner to read the file. We set the delimiter to be a comma followed by a space or a new line. We then use the next() method to get the name and nextDouble() to get the mass. We put the name and mass into the elementMap. If there's an IOException, we print the stack trace and show an error dialog.\n\nNote: The Scanner class is more powerful and flexible than StringTokenizer and it's recommended for new code.\n```\nI'm having trouble with my scanner when it's reading a file.
