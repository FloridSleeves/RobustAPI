I understand that we use read() to read byte to byte. but how do we do the comparison? \nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: $API\nInputStream in = new FileInputStream(\"file.txt\");\nint data = in.read();\nwhile (data != -1) {\n    if (data != someByte) {\n        // do something\n    }\n    data = in.read();\n}\nin.close();\n$CODE\n$EXPLANATION\nIn this code, we use a FileInputStream to read the file \"file.txt\". We read the first byte into the variable \"data\". We then enter a while loop that continues until we have read all bytes in the file. Inside the loop, we compare the byte read with \"someByte\". If they are not equal, we do something. After that, we read the next byte into \"data\" and continue the loop. When there are no more bytes to read, read() returns -1, which we check at the beginning of the loop and if it is true, we break the loop. Finally, we close the InputStream to free up resources.\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\nImprove this question\nClosed 8 years ago.\n"}
