It represents a general list of objects. The ArrayList class implements the List interface and provides various methods for manipulating the list. The ArrayList class is a resizable array, which means that it can grow and shrink dynamically as needed. It also provides methods for adding, removing, and accessing elements in the list. The main difference between a List and an ArrayList is that ArrayList is a class that implements the List interface and provides additional methods for manipulating the list. It also provides methods for adding, removing, and accessing elements in the list. The List interface itself does not provide any methods for adding, removing, or accessing elements. It is up to the implementing class (like ArrayList) to provide these methods.\n<jupyter_code>\nanswer = \"\"\"\n<<<api>>>: List list = new ArrayList();\n<<<code>>>: List list = new ArrayList();\n<<<explanation>>>: The List interface in Java is a part of the Java Collections Framework.

It represents a collection of objects where every object is unique (no duplicates). The HashSet class implements the Set interface and provides various methods for manipulating the set.
