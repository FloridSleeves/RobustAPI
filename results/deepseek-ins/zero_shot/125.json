Here's how you can do it:\n\n<<<api>>>: Java's built-in serialization\n<<<code>>>:\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {\n        int number = 123;\n        double dbl = 456.789;\n        int[] my_list = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\n\n        // Convert to bytes\n        ByteArrayOutputStream bos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();\n        ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(bos);\n        out.writeInt(number);\n        out.writeDouble(dbl);\n        out.writeInt(my_list.length);\n        for (int i : my_list) {\n            out.writeInt(i);\n        }\n        out.flush();\n        byte[] bytes = bos.toByteArray();\n\n        // Convert back to original form\n        ByteArrayInputStream bis = new ByteArrayInputStream(bytes);\n        ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(bis);\n        int number2 = in.readInt();\n        double dbl2 = in.readDouble();\n        int[] my_list2 = new int[in.readInt()];\n        for (int i = 0; i < my_list2.length; i++) {\n            my_list2[i] = in.readInt();\n        }\n\n        System.out.println(number2);\n        System.out.println(dbl2);\n        for (int i : my_list2) {\n            System.out.println(i);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: This code uses Java's built-in serialization to convert your data to bytes and back. The `ObjectOutputStream` writes the data to a `ByteArrayOutputStream`, which then gives us the byte array. The `ObjectInputStream` reads the data from a `ByteArrayInputStream`.\n\nThis method is faster than using `replace` and `split` because it uses Java's built-in serialization, which is optimized for performance. It also avoids the overhead of regular expressions and string manipulation.\n\nHowever, please note that this method assumes that the order of your data types in the original array matches the order in which they are read back. If this is not the case, you will need to use a more complex method to read the data back in the correct order.\n\nAlso, this method only works for primitive types and arrays of primitive types. If you have other types of objects in your array, you will need to implement a custom serialization method for those types.\n\nIf you need to send this data over a network or save it to a file, you might want to consider using a more robust serialization library like Jackson or Gson, which provide more features and better performance.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n"}
