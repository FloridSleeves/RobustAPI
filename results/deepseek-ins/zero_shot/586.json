Here's an example:\n\n```java\nimport com.google.gson.*;\nimport com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken;\nimport com.google.gson.stream.JsonReader;\nimport com.google.gson.stream.JsonWriter;\n\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.lang.reflect.Type;\nimport java.text.ParseException;\nimport java.text.SimpleDateFormat;\nimport java.util.Date;\nimport java.util.Locale;\n\npublic class DateTypeAdapterFactory implements TypeAdapterFactory {\n\n    @Override\n    public <T> TypeAdapter<T> create(Gson gson, TypeToken<T> typeToken) {\n        Class<? super T> rawType = typeToken.getRawType();\n        if (rawType != Date.class) {\n            return null;\n        }\n\n        return (TypeAdapter<T>) new DateTypeAdapter();\n    }\n\n    public static class DateTypeAdapter extends TypeAdapter<Date> {\n\n        private static final String[] DATE_FORMATS = new String[]{\n                \"yyyy-MM-dd\",\n                \"dd/MM/yyyy\",\n                \"yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZ\"\n        };\n\n        @Override\n        public void write(JsonWriter out, Date value) throws IOException {\n            throw new UnsupportedOperationException();\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public Date read(JsonReader in) throws IOException {\n            String dateString = in.nextString();\n            for (String format : DATE_FORMATS) {\n                try {\n                    return new SimpleDateFormat(format, Locale.US).parse(dateString);\n                } catch (ParseException e) {\n                    // try next format\n                }\n            }\n            throw new JsonParseException(\"Unparseable date: \" + dateString);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou can use this factory with Gson like this:\n\n```java\nGson gson = new GsonBuilder()\n        .registerTypeAdapterFactory(new DateTypeAdapterFactory())\n        .create();\n```\n\nThis will make Gson try to parse dates in the formats specified in `DATE_FORMATS`. If it can't parse a date with any of these formats, it will throw a `JsonParseException`.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the date strings in your JSON are always in one of the specified formats. If this is not the case, you might need to adjust the parsing logic to handle different date formats.\n\nAlso, please note that this solution might not be suitable for all use cases. For example, if you have a date string that is in a format that is not specified in `DATE_FORMATS`, this solution will throw a `JsonParseException`. If this is not what you want, you might need to adjust the parsing logic to handle different date formats.\n\nPlease note that this solution might not be suitable for all use cases.
