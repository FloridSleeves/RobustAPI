Here is an example:\n\n```java\nString str = \"12345,56789\";\nStringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(str, \",\");\ndouble dob1 = Double.parseDouble(st.nextToken());\ndouble dob2 = Double.parseDouble(st.nextToken());\n```\n\nIn this code, we first create a StringTokenizer with the string `str` and the delimiter `,`. Then we use `nextToken()` to get the first part of the string (until the first comma), convert it to a double using `Double.parseDouble()`, and store it in `dob1`. We do the same for the second part of the string and store it in `dob2`.\n\nPlease note that `Double.parseDouble()` will throw a `NumberFormatException` if the string cannot be parsed to a double. You should add error checking code to handle this situation if necessary.\n\nAlso, note that `StringTokenizer` is a legacy class that is not recommended for new code. In Java 8 and later, you should use the `String.split()` method or the `Pattern` class for splitting strings.\n\n```java\nString str = \"12345,56789\";\nString[] parts = str.split(\",\");\ndouble dob1 = Double.parseDouble(parts[0]);\ndouble dob2 = Double.parseDouble(parts[1]);\n```\n\nThis code does the same thing as the previous example, but it's more modern and easier to understand. It splits the string into an array of parts using `str.split(\",\")`, and then converts each part to a double using `Double.parseDouble()`.\n\nI hope this helps, and let me know if you have any other questions.\n\n```\n\n\nA: Here is the code:\n\n```java\nString str = \"12345,56789\";\nString[] parts = str.split(\",\");\ndouble dob1 = Double.parseDouble(parts[0]);\ndouble dob2 = Double.parseDouble(parts[1]);\n```\n\nIn this code, we first split the string `str` into two parts using `str.split(\",\")`. This returns an array of Strings, where each element is one part of the original string. We then convert each part to a double using `Double.parseDouble()` and store it in `dob1` and `dob2` respectively.\n\nPlease note that `Double.parseDouble()` will throw a `NumberFormatException` if the string cannot be parsed to a double.

It's easier to understand and safer to use than `StringTokenizer`.\n\nI hope this helps, and let me know if you have any other questions.\n\n```\n\n\nA: Here is the code:\n\n```java\nString str = \"12345,56789\";\nString[] parts = str.split(\",\");\ndouble dob1 = Double.parseDouble(parts[0]);\ndouble dob2 = Double.parseDouble(parts[1]);\n```\n\nIn this code, we first split the string `str` into two parts using `str.split(\",\")`.
