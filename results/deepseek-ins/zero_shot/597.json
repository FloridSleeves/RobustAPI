Really I want the distinction between Strings and List to be transparent to the user of the class.\nPlease using this api: List.get.\nAnswer: You can use a Map<String, Object> to store either a String or a List<String>. The Object type allows you to store any type of object. However, you need to ensure that only Strings or Lists of Strings are stored in the map. You can do this by checking the type of the object when you retrieve it from the map.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.List;\nimport java.util.Map;\n\npublic class Record {\n    private Map<String, Object> attrs;\n\n    public Record(String key, Map<String, Object> attrs) {\n        // check that attrs only contains Objects which are Strings or List<Strings>\n        for (Object value : attrs.values()) {\n            if (!(value instanceof String || value instanceof List)) {\n                throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Invalid value type: \" + value.getClass().getName());\n            }\n            if (value instanceof List) {\n                List<?> list = (List<?>) value;\n                for (Object element : list) {\n                    if (!(element instanceof String)) {\n                        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Invalid list element type: \" + element.getClass().getName());\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        this.attrs = attrs;\n    }\n\n    public String getString(String key) {\n        Object value = attrs.get(key);\n        if (value instanceof String) {\n            return (String) value;\n        } else if (value instanceof List) {\n            List<String> list = (List<String>) value;\n            return list.get(0);\n        } else {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Invalid value type: \" + value.getClass().getName());\n        }\n    }\n\n    public List<String> getList(String key) {\n        Object value = attrs.get(key);\n        if (value instanceof List) {\n            return (List<String>) value;\n        } else {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Invalid value type: \" + value.getClass().getName());\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the Record class has a constructor that takes a Map<String, Object>. It checks that all values in the map are either Strings or Lists of Strings. If not, it throws an IllegalArgumentException. The getString and getList methods allow you to retrieve the values from the map as Strings or Lists of Strings, respectively.\n\nPlease note that the getList method will only return the first element of the list if the list contains only one element. If the list contains more than one element, it will return the entire list.\n\nI hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\nAnswer: You can use a Map<String, Object> to store either a String or a List<String>. The Object type allows you to store any type of object.
