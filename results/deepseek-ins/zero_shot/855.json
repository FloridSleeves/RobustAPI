The readChar() method is used to read a character from the file. The readByte() method is used to read a byte from the file. We can use these methods to read the header, dummy byte and number of files from the file.\n\nA: You can use DataInputStream to read primitive types and Strings from a RandomAccessFile.\nHere is an example:\nRandomAccessFile raf = new RandomAccessFile(file, \"r\");\nDataInputStream dis = new DataInputStream(new BufferedInputStream(raf));\n\n// Read the header\nbyte[] headerBytes = new byte[3];\ndis.readFully(headerBytes);\nString header = new String(headerBytes);\n\n// Read the dummy byte\nbyte dummy = dis.readByte();\n\n// Read the number of files\nbyte nFiles = dis.readByte();\n\n// Read the file entries\nfor (int i = 0; i < nFiles; i++) {\n    // Read the dummy byte\n    byte dummy = dis.readByte();\n\n    // Read the file name\n    byte[] fileNameBytes = new byte[12];\n    dis.readFully(fileNameBytes);\n    String fileName = new String(fileNameBytes);\n\n    // Read the dummy byte\n    byte dummy = dis.readByte();\n\n    // Read the offset\n    int offset = dis.readInt();\n\n    // Process the file entry...\n}\n\ndis.close();\n\nThis code reads the header, dummy byte, and number of files from the file. It then reads each file entry, which includes a dummy byte, a file name, another dummy byte, and an offset. The file entries are processed in a loop.\nThe readFully() method is used to read a specified number of bytes from the file. If the end of the file is reached before the specified number of bytes are read, an IOException is thrown.\nThe DataInputStream class provides methods to read primitive types and Strings from a file. It is a higher-level class than RandomAccessFile, and it provides more convenient methods for reading data.\n\nA: You can use DataInputStream to read primitive types and Strings from a RandomAccessFile.
