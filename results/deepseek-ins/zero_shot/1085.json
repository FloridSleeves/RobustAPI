The tokens are then printed to the console.\n\n\nA: You can use Jsoup library to parse HTML and apply CSS. Here is a simple example:\n\n```java\nimport org.jsoup.Jsoup;\nimport org.jsoup.nodes.Document;\nimport org.jsoup.nodes.Element;\nimport org.jsoup.select.Elements;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String html = \"<html><head><link rel=\\\"stylesheet\\\" type=\\\"text/css\\\" href=\\\"mystyle.css\\\"></head><body><p id=\\\"test\\\">Hello World</p></body></html>\";\n        Document doc = Jsoup.parse(html);\n\n        Elements css = doc.select(\"link[rel=stylesheet]\");\n        for (Element style : css) {\n            String href = style.attr(\"abs:href\");\n            String cssContent = readFile(href);\n            style.before(cssContent);\n            style.remove();\n        }\n\n        Elements scripts = doc.select(\"script[type=text/css]\");\n        for (Element script : scripts) {\n            script.before(script.data());\n            script.remove();\n        }\n\n        System.out.println(doc);\n    }\n\n    private static String readFile(String path) {\n        // Read file and return its content as string\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code will read the HTML string, parse it with Jsoup, and then find all the link elements that have a rel attribute of stylesheet. For each of these, it will read the CSS file, and then insert the CSS content before the link element in the HTML. It will then remove the link element.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that you have a method to read a file and return its content as a string. You would need to implement this method yourself.\n\nAlso, this code does not handle errors that may occur when reading the CSS file. You would need to add error handling code to handle these situations.\n\nThis code does not handle inline styles. If you want to inline styles, you would need to add code to handle these.\n\nThis code does not handle external CSS files that are loaded via JavaScript.
