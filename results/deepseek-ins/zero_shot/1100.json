The first token is \"Breakpoint\". The second token is \"10\", and the third token is \"main ()\". The fourth token is \"at\". The fifth token is \"file.c:10\". We then loop through the remaining tokens and assign the last token to the variable thirdWord. The output of this code will be \"file.c:10\".\n```\n\nA:\n```java\nString str = \"Breakpoint 10, main () at file.c:10\";\nStringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(str, \" ,\");\nString thirdWord = st.nextToken();\nwhile(st.hasMoreTokens()) {\n    thirdWord = st.nextToken();\n}\nSystem.out.println(thirdWord);\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: This code uses StringTokenizer to break the string into tokens based on the delimiter which is either a space or a comma.
