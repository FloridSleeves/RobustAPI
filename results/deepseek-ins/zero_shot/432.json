The next() method returns a generic type E, so you need to ensure that the type of the variable next matches the type of the object returned by the next() method. In this case, E is the type parameter of the Set that you are iterating over, so you can use E as the type of the variable next.\n\nA: The error is because the type of the variable next is not compatible with the type of the object returned by the next() method of the Iterator.
