I don't want to repeat all calculations on every call to F(i).\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: Yes, it is possible to create a collection in Java 8 that grows in a lazy way, defined by recursion. You can use the `Stream` API to achieve this. Here is an example:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Iterator;\nimport java.util.stream.Stream;\nimport java.util.stream.Stream.Builder;\n\npublic class Fibonacci {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Stream<Integer> fiboStream = Stream.iterate(new int[]{0, 1}, t -> new int[]{t[1], t[0] + t[1]})\n                .map(t -> t[0]);\n\n        Iterator<Integer> iterator = fiboStream.iterator();\n        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n            System.out.println(iterator.next());\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we use `Stream.iterate()` to create a stream that generates the Fibonacci sequence. The `iterate()` method takes an initial value and a function that generates the next value based on the previous one. The function takes an array of two integers (the last two Fibonacci numbers) and returns a new array with the next Fibonacci number.\n\nThe `map()` method is used to extract the first element of each pair in the stream (the Fibonacci numbers).\n\nThe `iterator()` method is used to get an `Iterator` from the stream. We can then call `next()` on this iterator to get the Fibonacci numbers in the sequence.\n\nThis solution is lazy, meaning that the Fibonacci numbers are only calculated as needed. The `iterator()` method returns a new iterator each time it is called, so each iterator can be used independently of the others.\n\nPlease note that this solution uses a `Stream`, which is a finite data structure. If you need an infinite data structure, you would need to use a different approach, such as a `Supplier` or a `Generator`.\n\nAlso, please note that the `Stream` API in Java 8 is not designed to be reused. If you try to reuse a stream, it will throw an exception. If you need to reuse a stream, you should convert it to a `List` or `Array`.\n\nThis solution does not allow you to get an element by index, as the stream is finite and does not support random access. If you need to get an element by index, you should convert the stream to a `List` or `Array`.\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Arrays;\nimport java.util.List;\nimport java.util.stream.Collectors;\nimport java.util.stream.Stream;\n\npublic class Fibonacci {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        List<Integer> fiboList = Stream.iterate(new int[]{0, 1}, t -> new int[]{t[1], t[0] + t[1]})\n                .map(t -> t[0])\n                .limit(10)\n                .collect(Collectors.toList());\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < fiboList.size(); i++) {\n            System.out.println(fiboList.get(i));\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we use the `limit()` method to limit the stream to the first 10 elements. This allows us to convert the stream to a `List`. We can then get elements from the list by index.\n\nPlease note that this solution does not support parallel execution. If you need to execute the stream in parallel, you should convert it to a `ParallelStream`.\n\nThis solution does not support the `peek()` method, which allows you to perform an action on each element of the stream without changing the stream. If you need to perform an action on each element of the stream, you should use the `forEach()` method.\n\nThis solution does not support the `skip()` method, which allows you to skip the first n elements of the stream. If you need to skip elements, you should use the `dropWhile()` method.\n\nThis solution does not support the `distinct()` method, which allows you to remove duplicate elements from the stream. If you need to remove duplicates, you should use the"}
