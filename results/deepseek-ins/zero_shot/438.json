You're only adding JLabels. To fix this, you should add the JRadioButtons to the JPanel as well. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```java\npaneGrids[0].add(buttonTest[j++]);\n```\n\nAfter this line, you should be able to see the radio buttons on your JPanel.\n\nNext, you need to override the `paintComponent` method of the JPanel that contains the radio buttons. This method is responsible for drawing the lines between the radio buttons. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```java\npublic class RadioButtonPanel extends JPanel {\n    // ...\n\n    @Override\n    protected void paintComponent(Graphics g) {\n        super.paintComponent(g);\n\n        Graphics2D g2d = (Graphics2D) g.create();\n        g2d.setColor(new Color(0xE3, 0xC9, 0x39));\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < lastButton.length - 1; i++) {\n            int currentButtonIndex = lastButton[i];\n            int nextButtonIndex = lastButton[i + 1];\n\n            if (currentButtonIndex != -1 && nextButtonIndex != -1) {\n                Point currentButtonPoint = buttonTest[currentButtonIndex].getLocation();\n                Point nextButtonPoint = buttonTest[nextButtonIndex].getLocation();\n\n                g2d.drawLine(\n                    (int) currentButtonPoint.getX() + buttonTest[currentButtonIndex].getWidth() / 2,\n                    (int) currentButtonPoint.getY() + buttonTest[currentButtonIndex].getHeight() / 2,\n                    (int) nextButtonPoint.getX() + buttonTest[nextButtonIndex].getWidth() / 2,\n                    (int) nextButtonPoint.getY() + buttonTest[nextButtonIndex].getHeight() / 2\n                );\n            }\n        }\n\n        g2d.dispose();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, we're overriding the `paintComponent` method of the `RadioButtonPanel`. We're creating a `Graphics2D` object from the `Graphics` object that's passed into the method. We're then setting the color of the `Graphics2D` object to the color you want to use for the lines. We're then looping through the `lastButton` array and drawing a line between each pair of radio buttons. The line is drawn from the center of the current radio button to the center of the next radio button.\n\nFinally, you need to replace the `JPanel` that contains the radio buttons with an instance of the `RadioButtonPanel` class. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```java\npaneGrids[0] = new RadioButtonPanel();\n```\n\nNow, when you select radio buttons, the lines should be drawn between them.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the radio buttons are added to the `RadioButtonPanel` in the order you want them to be connected by lines. If this is not the case, you may need to adjust the logic in the `paintComponent` method to match your needs.\n\nAlso, please note that the `paintComponent` method is called automatically when the panel needs to be repainted. You don't need to call it yourself.\n\nI hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\nNote: The `getWidth() / 2` and `getHeight() / 2` are used to get the center of the button. If the button is not square, this will not give the correct result. You may need to adjust this depending on the specifics of your buttons.\n\nNote: The `Graphics2D` object is disposed of after it's no longer needed. This is a good practice to follow to prevent memory leaks.\n\nNote: The `paintComponent` method is not a static method. It should be called on an instance of the class that contains the `paintComponent` method. In your case, you should call it on an instance of the `RadioButtonPanel` class.\n\nNote: The `Graphics` object passed into the `paintComponent` method is not the same as the `Graphics` object you're using"}
