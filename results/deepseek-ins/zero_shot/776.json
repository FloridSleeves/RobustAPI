It also checks if the character is alphabetic before trying to encrypt it. If the character is 'z', it wraps around to 'a'. The encrypted text is then written to a new file.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the input file contains only lowercase letters and spaces. If the input file contains uppercase letters, numbers, or special characters, you will need to modify the code to handle these cases.\n\nAlso, the code uses a StringBuilder to build the encrypted string, which is more efficient than using an ArrayList of characters. The StringBuilder is converted to a string and written to the output file using the PrintWriter's write method.\n\nThis code should work for most cases, but please test it thoroughly to ensure it meets your requirements.\n\n<<<api>>>: File, Scanner, PrintWriter, Character\n\n<<<code>>>: The provided code\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The code reads in a file of text, and \"encrypts\" each letter to +1 from the ASCII table.
