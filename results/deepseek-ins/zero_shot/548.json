In this case, we are passing the entry set of the map to it. The Map.Entry.comparingByValue() method is used to specify that we want to compare the values of the entries in the map. The entry with the maximum value will be returned by the method.\n\nQuestion: How to sort a HashMap by values in Java: :How can I sort a HashMap by its values?\nPlease using this api: TreeMap.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: TreeMap\n<<<code>>>: \nTreeMap<K,V> sortedMap = new TreeMap<>(someMap);\n<<<explanation>>>: A TreeMap in Java is a class which implements the SortedMap interface. It stores elements in key-value pairs and provides an efficient way to get, put, remove and iterate over elements. By default, it sorts elements based on their keys. But we can also provide a custom comparator to sort elements based on their values. This can be done by passing a custom comparator to the TreeMap constructor. In this case, we are passing a comparator that compares the values of the map entries. The TreeMap will then sort its elements based on these values.\n\nQuestion: How to remove duplicates from a List in Java: :How can I remove duplicates from a List in Java?\nPlease using this api: Set.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Set\n<<<code>>>: \nList<T> listWithNoDuplicates = new ArrayList<>(new HashSet<>(originalList));\n<<<explanation>>>: A Set in Java is a collection that cannot contain duplicate elements. By converting a List to a Set, we automatically remove any duplicate elements. Then we convert the Set back to a List. This will create a new List with no duplicate elements.\n\nQuestion: How to reverse a String in Java: :How can I reverse a String in Java?\nPlease using this api: StringBuilder.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: StringBuilder\n<<<code>>>: \nString reversedString = new StringBuilder(originalString).reverse().toString();\n<<<explanation>>>: The StringBuilder class in Java provides a method called reverse() which can be used to reverse a String. We first create a StringBuilder instance with the original string, then call the reverse() method to reverse the string, and finally call the toString() method to convert the StringBuilder back to a String.\n\nQuestion: How to check if a String contains a substring in Java: :How can I check if a String contains a substring in Java?\nPlease using this api: String.contains.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: String.contains\n<<<code>>>: \nboolean containsSubstring = originalString.contains(substring);\n<<<explanation>>>: The String class in Java provides a method called contains() which can be used to check if a String contains a substring. It returns true if the String contains the substring, and false otherwise.\n\nQuestion: How to split a String into an Array in Java: :How can I split a String into an Array in Java?\nPlease using this api: String.split.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: String.split\n<<<code>>>: \nString[] array = originalString.split(delimiter);\n<<<explanation>>>: The String class in Java provides a method called split() which can be used to split a String into an array of Strings. The delimiter is a character or a regular expression that specifies where to split the String. The split() method returns an array of Strings.\n\nQuestion: How to join elements of an Array into a String in Java: :How can I join elements of an Array into a String in Java?\nPlease using this api: String.join.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: String.join\n<<<code>>>: \nString joinedString = String.join(delimiter, array);\n<<<explanation>>>: The String class in Java provides a static method called join() which can be used to join elements of an array into a single String. The delimiter is a character or"}
