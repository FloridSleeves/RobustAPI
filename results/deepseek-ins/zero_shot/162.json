Also is it better to just read up the input stream into an array or string and then create input streams for each use ?EDIT 2:Sorry to reopen the question, but the conditions are somewhat different when working inside desktop and web application. First of all, the InputStream i get from the org.apache.commons.fileupload.FileItem in my tomcat web app doesn't support markings thus cannot reset.

This will buffer the data so that you can re-read it.\nHere is an example:\nBufferedInputStream bufferedInputStream = new BufferedInputStream(inputStream);\n\nThen you can read from bufferedInputStream as many times as you want.\nHowever, please note that BufferedInputStream does not support the mark and reset methods. If you need to re-read the data, you will have to read it again.\n\nA: You can use a ByteArrayOutputStream to copy the InputStream to a byte array. Then you can create as many ByteArrayInputStreams from this byte array as you need.\nByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();\nIOUtils.copy(inputStream, baos);\nbyte[] bytes = baos.toByteArray();\n\n// Now you can create as many ByteArrayInputStreams as you need:\nByteArrayInputStream bais1 = new ByteArrayInputStream(bytes);\nByteArrayInputStream bais2 = new ByteArrayInputStream(bytes);\n\n// And use them with POIFSFileSystem:\nPOIFSFileSystem fs1 = new POIFSFileSystem(bais1);\nPOIFSFileSystem fs2 = new POIFSFileSystem(bais2);\n\nThis way, you are not closing the original InputStream and you can use the same byte array for multiple InputStreams.\n\nA: You can use a ByteArrayOutputStream to copy the InputStream to a byte array.
