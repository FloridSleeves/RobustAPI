In your case, you are trying to modify the collection (virusDB) while you are iterating over it with the iterator (iteratorVirusDB).\n\nTo fix this, you should not modify the collection while iterating over it. Instead, you should create a copy of the collection and iterate over the copy. Here is how you can do it:\n\n```java\nIterator<VirusData> iteratorVirusDB = virusDB.iterator();\nwhile(iteratorVirusDB.hasNext()) {\n    VirusData v = iteratorVirusDB.next();\n    String vSig = v.signature;\n    v.tokens = tokenize.raw(vSig, true, tLength);\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, you are creating a copy of the iterator and iterating over the copy. This way, you are not modifying the original collection while you are iterating over it.\n\nAlternatively, you can use a for-each loop, which is safer and more readable:\n\n```java\nfor(VirusData v : virusDB) {\n    String vSig = v.signature;\n    v.tokens = tokenize.raw(vSig, true, tLength);\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, you are iterating over the original collection and you are not modifying it. This is a safer and more readable way to iterate over a collection.\n\nI hope this helps you to avoid the ConcurrentModificationException. Let me know if you have any further questions.\n\nNote: The ConcurrentModificationException is a runtime exception and it is thrown by methods that have detected concurrent modification of an object when such modification is not permissible.\n\nFor example, it is not generally permissible for one thread to modify a Collection while another thread is iterating over it. In general, the results of the iteration are undefined under these circumstances.\n\nMore details can be found in the Java documentation: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ConcurrentModificationException.html\n\nThis exception does not always indicate that an object has been concurrently modified by a different thread. If a single thread issues a sequence of method invocations that violates the contract of an object, the object may throw this exception. For example, if a thread modifies a collection directly while it is iterating over the collection with a fail-fast iterator, the iterator will throw this exception.\n\nIn your case, you should not modify the collection while iterating over it. Instead, you should create a copy of the collection and iterate over the copy.\n\nI hope this helps you to avoid the ConcurrentModificationException.
