We generate a random number between 1 and 25, and if that number has already been used in the array, we generate a new number. We continue this until we have generated 25 unique numbers.\n\n\nA: Here is a simple way to fill a 2D array with random non-duplicate numbers in Java:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Random;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int[][] array = new int[5][5];\n        boolean[][] used = new boolean[5][5];\n        Random rand = new Random();\n\n        int counter = 0;\n        while (counter < 25) {\n            int i = rand.nextInt(5);\n            int j = rand.nextInt(5);\n            if (!used[i][j]) {\n                array[i][j] = counter + 1; // +1 because we want numbers from 1 to 25\n                used[i][j] = true;\n                counter++;\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Print the array\n        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++) {\n                System.out.print(array[i][j] + \" \");\n            }\n            System.out.println();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code creates a 5x5 array and a 5x5 boolean array to keep track of which cells have been used. It then generates random numbers between 0 and 4 for the row and column indices. If the cell at the generated indices has not been used yet, it sets the value of the cell to the current counter value (starting from 1) and marks the cell as used. The counter is incremented until it reaches 25.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that you want to fill the array in a random manner, without any specific order. If you want to fill the array in a specific order, you would need to modify the code accordingly.\n\nAlso, this code uses the `java.util.Random` class to generate random numbers.\n\nThe explanation for the code is as follows:\n\n- We first initialize the 2D array and the boolean 2D array.\n- We then initialize a counter to 0.\n- We enter a while loop that continues until the counter is 25.\n- Inside the while loop, we generate random row and column indices.\n- If the cell at the generated indices has not been used yet, we set the value of the cell to the current counter value and mark the cell as used.\n- We then increment the counter.\n- After the while loop, we print the 2D array to check that it contains 25 unique numbers.\n\nThis code should work for your needs.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that you want to fill the array in a random manner, without any specific order.
