The reason is that the Connection class is not thread-safe and should not be shared across multiple threads. Each thread should have its own Connection instance. This is because the Connection class is designed to be used in a multi-threaded environment, and sharing a Connection across multiple threads can lead to unexpected behavior.\n\nIn your code, you are creating a new Connection for each message sent. This is the correct approach because each message should be sent on its own connection. If you were to share a Connection across multiple threads, you could run into issues with message delivery order, message acknowledgments, and other concurrency issues.\n\nBy creating a new Connection for each message, you ensure that each message is sent on its own connection and that each message is processed in the order it was received. This is a best practice for using RabbitMQ in a multi-threaded environment.\n\nSo, in your case, you should not use a Singleton for the Connection. Instead, you should create a new Connection for each message sent.\n\nHere is the modified code:\n\n```java\nprivate void send(String routingKey, String message) throws Exception {\n    String exchange = applicationConfiguration.getAMQPExchange();\n    String ipAddress = applicationConfiguration.getAMQPHost();\n    String exchangeType = applicationConfiguration.getAMQPExchangeType();\n    String password = applicationConfiguration.getAMQPUser();\n    String user = applicationConfiguration.getAMQPPassword();\n    String virtualHost = applicationConfiguration.getAMQPVirtualHost();\n    String port = applicationConfiguration.getAMQPPort();\n    ConnectionFactory factory = new ConnectionFactory();\n    factory.setUsername(user);\n    factory.setPassword(password);\n    factory.setVirtualHost(virtualHost);\n    factory.setPort(Integer.parseInt(port));\n    factory.setHost(ipAddress);\n    Connection connection = factory.newConnection();\n    Channel channel = connection.createChannel();\n    channel.exchangeDeclare(exchange, exchangeType);\n    channel.basicPublish(exchange, routingKey, null, message.getBytes());\n    log.debug(\" [AMQP] Sent message with key {} : {}\", routingKey, message);\n    connection.close();\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, a new Connection is created for each message sent. This ensures that each message is sent on its own connection and that each message is processed in the order it was received.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the applicationConfiguration object is correctly configured with the correct values for the RabbitMQ connection.\n\nAlso, remember to handle exceptions properly in your code. The code above does not handle exceptions for simplicity. In a production environment, you should handle exceptions properly to avoid data loss or system crashes.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n"}
