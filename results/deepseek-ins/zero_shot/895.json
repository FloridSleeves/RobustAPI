If the map is empty, it returns null.\n\n\nA: The TreeMap class implements the SortedMap interface, so you can use the firstKey() method on a TreeMap instance.\nHowever, the error you're seeing suggests that your code is trying to call this method on a SortedMap interface reference, which doesn't have a firstKey() method.\nHere's how you should be calling it:\nSystem.out.println(((TreeMap<Integer, Character>) memory).firstKey());\n\nThis casts the memory reference to a TreeMap, which has the firstKey() method.\nPlease note that this cast will throw a ClassCastException if memory is not actually a TreeMap. So, you should ensure that memory is a TreeMap before trying to call firstKey().\n\nA: The error message is indicating that the method firstKey() is not found in the interface java.util.Map. This is correct, because the method firstKey() is part of the TreeMap class, not the Map interface.\nTo use the firstKey() method, you need to cast your SortedMap to a TreeMap. Here's how you can do it:\nSystem.out.println(((TreeMap<Integer, Character>) memory).firstKey());\n\nThis casts memory to a TreeMap, which has the firstKey() method.\nPlease note that this cast will throw a ClassCastException if memory is not actually a TreeMap. So, you should ensure that memory is a TreeMap before trying to call firstKey().\n\nA: The error is because you are trying to call a method that is not part of the Map interface, but is part of the TreeMap class. The TreeMap class implements the SortedMap interface, which has the firstKey() method.\nYou can cast your SortedMap to a TreeMap and then call the firstKey() method:\nSystem.out.println(((TreeMap<Integer, Character>) memory).firstKey());\n\nThis will work if memory is a TreeMap. If it's not, you'll get a ClassCastException.\n\nA: The error is because you are trying to call a method that is not part of the Map interface, but is part of the TreeMap class.
