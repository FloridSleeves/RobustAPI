When a connection is established, it reads the message from the client and sends a response.\n\nAPI: Socket socket = new Socket(\"localhost\", 6000);\n\nCode: \nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.net.*;\n\npublic class Client {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        Socket socket = new Socket(\"localhost\", 6000);\n        System.out.println(\"Connected to the server!\");\n\n        DataOutputStream out = new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());\n        out.writeUTF(\"Hello from \" + socket.getLocalSocketAddress());\n\n        DataInputStream in = new DataInputStream(socket.getInputStream());\n        System.out.println(in.readUTF());\n\n        socket.close();\n    }\n}\n\nExplanation: \nThe client connects to the server at localhost on port 6000. It sends a message to the server and reads the response.\n\nAPI: socket.getOutputStream().write(policy.getBytes());\n\nCode: \nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.net.*;\n\npublic class Server {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(6000);\n        System.out.println(\"Waiting for client on port \" + serverSocket.getLocalPort() + \"...\");\n\n        Socket socket = serverSocket.accept();\n        System.out.println(\"Connected to \" + socket.getRemoteSocketAddress());\n\n        DataInputStream in = new DataInputStream(socket.getInputStream());\n        System.out.println(in.readUTF());\n\n        String policy = \"<policy-file-request/>\";\n        socket.getOutputStream().write(policy.getBytes());\n\n        socket.close();\n    }\n}\n\nExplanation: \nThe server sends a policy file request to the client. The policy file request is a string that the client sends to the server to request the policy file. The server then sends back the policy file.\n\nAPI: socket.getInputStream().read(buffer);\n\nCode: \nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.net.*;\n\npublic class Client {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        Socket"}
