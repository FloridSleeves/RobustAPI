The bytes of these strings are first obtained using the getBytes() method with the UTF-8 character encoding. The hash is then encoded in Base64 format using the Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString() method. The resulting Base64 encoded string is returned as the signature.\n\nNote: The java.security.MessageDigest class is used to create and update a message digest. The update method is called to add the bytes of the secret and pathAndQuery strings to the message digest. The digest() method is then called to compute the hash of the message digest. This hash is then encoded in Base64 format using the Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString() method.\n\nThe java.util.Base64 class is used to encode the hash in Base64 format. The Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString() method is used to encode the hash in Base64 format and return it as a string.\n\nThe java.security.MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\") method is used to get an instance of the SHA-256 message digest algorithm.\n\nThe java.lang.Exception class is used to handle any exceptions that may occur during the execution of the code.\n\nThe java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets class is used to get the UTF_8 character set.\n\nThe java.nio.charset.CharsetEncoder class is used to encode the bytes of the secret and pathAndQuery strings.\n\nThe java.nio.charset.CodingErrorAction class is used to specify the action to take when a coding error occurs.\n\nThe java.nio.charset.CharacterCodingException class is used to indicate that a character coding error has occurred.\n\nThe java.nio.charset.Charset class is used to represent a charset.\n\nThe java.nio.charset.CharsetDecoder class is used to decode bytes into characters.\n\nThe java.nio.charset.CharsetEncoder class is used to encode characters into bytes.\n\nThe java.nio.charset.CoderResult class is used to represent the result of a character coding operation.\n\nThe java.nio.charset.CharacterCodingException class is used to indicate that a character coding error has occurred.\n\nThe java.nio.charset.UnmappableCharacterException class is used to indicate that a character cannot be mapped to a target character set.\n\nThe java.nio.charset.MalformedInputException class is used to indicate that the input is malformed.\n\nThe java.nio.charset.CharacterCodingException class is used to indicate that a character coding error has occurred.\n\nThe java.nio.charset.CodingErrorAction class is used to specify the action to take when a coding error occurs.\n\nThe java.nio.charset.CharacterCodingException class is used to indicate that a character coding error has occurred.\n\nThe java.nio.charset.Charset class is used to represent a charset.\n\nThe java.nio.charset.CharsetDecoder class is used to decode bytes into characters.\n\nThe java.nio.charset.CharsetEncoder class is used to encode characters into bytes.\n\nThe java.nio.charset.CoderResult class is used to represent the result of a character coding operation.\n\nThe java.nio.charset.CharacterCodingException class is used to indicate that a character coding error has occurred.\n\nThe java.nio.charset."}
