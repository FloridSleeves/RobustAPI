First I need to read 1 or more trace files. Each contains memory addresses for each access. Example: 0 F001CBAD2 EEECA89F0 EBC17910...Where the first integer indicates a read/write etc. then the hex memory address follows. With this data, I am supposed to run a simulation. So the idea I had was parse these data into an ArrayList<Trace> (for now I am using Java) with trace being a simple class containing the memory address and the access type (just a String and an integer). After which I plan to loop through these array lists to process them. The problem is even at parsing, it running out of heap space. Each trace file is ~200MB. I have up  to 8. Meaning minimum of ~1.6 GB of data I am trying to \"cache\"? What baffles me is I am only parsing 1 file and java is using 2GB according to my task manager ... What is a better way of doing this?

It reads the file line by line, which significantly reduces the amount of memory used. The FileReader reads the file character by character, which can lead to out of memory errors for large files.\n\n\nA: If you are reading a file line by line, you can use BufferedReader. It is more efficient because it reads the file line by line, not character by character.\n\n```java\nBufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"file.txt\"));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(line);\n    int accessType = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\n    String memoryAddress = st.nextToken();\n    Trace trace = new Trace(accessType, memoryAddress);\n    traces.add(trace);\n}\nbr.close();\n```\n\nThis code reads the file line by line, and for each line, it tokenizes the line into access type and memory address. It then creates a new Trace object with these values and adds it to the list of traces.\n\nIf you still encounter memory issues, it might be because you are storing all the Trace objects in memory at once. Instead, you could process the file line by line, creating and using a Trace object as you go. This way, you only ever have one Trace object in memory at a time, which should help to reduce the memory usage.\n\nAlso, consider using try-with-resources to automatically close the BufferedReader when you are done with it. This can help to prevent resource leaks.\n\n```java\ntry (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"file.txt\"))) {\n    String line;\n    while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n        StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(line);\n        int accessType = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\n        String memoryAddress = st.nextToken();\n        Trace trace = new Trace(accessType, memoryAddress);\n        // process the trace here\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code does the same thing as the previous code, but it automatically closes the BufferedReader when it is no longer needed.\n\nI hope this helps to solve your problem. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask.\n\nA: If you are still facing memory issues, you might want to consider using a database to store your data. Databases are designed to handle large amounts of data efficiently, and they can also be used to query the data if needed.\n\nIf you still want to use Java for this, you can use a database like H2 or Derby that is embedded and does not require a lot of memory. You can read the data from the file and insert it into the database as you read it.\n\nHere is a simple example of how you can do this:\n\n```java\ntry (Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(\"jdbc:h2:mem:\");\n     Statement stmt = conn.createStatement()) {\n\n    stmt.executeUpdate(\"CREATE TABLE traces (accessType INT, memoryAddress VARCHAR)\");\n\n    try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"file.txt\"))) {\n        String line;\n        while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n            StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(line);\n            int accessType = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\n            String memoryAddress = st.nextToken();\n            stmt.executeUpdate(\"INSERT INTO traces VALUES (\" + accessType + \", '\" + memoryAddress + \"')\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(\"SELECT * FROM traces\");\n    while (rs.next()) {"}
