We need to convert the integer random to a string before writing it to the file.\n\nQuestion: What is the difference between PrintWriter.write and PrintWriter.println?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write, PrintWriter.println\n<<<code>>>: writer.write(String.valueOf(random));, writer.println(random);\n<<<explanation>>>: The difference between PrintWriter.write and PrintWriter.println is that PrintWriter.write does not add a newline character at the end of the string. PrintWriter.println, on the other hand, adds a newline character at the end of the string.\n\nQuestion: How can I ensure that the numbers are not overwritten in the file?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: writer.write(String.valueOf(random));\n<<<explanation>>>: To ensure that the numbers are not overwritten in the file, you should use PrintWriter.write instead of PrintWriter.println. PrintWriter.println adds a newline character at the end of the string, which will overwrite the existing content in the file. Instead, use PrintWriter.write to write the string to the file without adding a newline character.\n\nQuestion: How can I append the numbers to the end of the file instead of overwriting them?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: writer.write(String.valueOf(random) + \"\\n\");\n<<<explanation>>>: To append the numbers to the end of the file instead of overwriting them, you should use PrintWriter.write with a newline character (\"\\n\") at the end of the string. This will add a newline character after each number, which will place each number on a new line in the file.\n\nQuestion: How can I add a space between the numbers?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: writer.write(String.valueOf(random) + \" \");\n<<<explanation>>>: To add a space between the numbers, you should use PrintWriter.write with a space character (\" \") at the end of the string. This will add a space after each number, separating them with spaces.\n\nQuestion: How can I add a comma between the numbers?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: writer.write(String.valueOf(random) + \", \");\n<<<explanation>>>: To add a comma between the numbers, you should use PrintWriter.write with a comma and a space character (\", \") at the end of the string. This will add a comma and a space after each number, separating them with commas and spaces.\n\nQuestion: How can I add a period at the end of the file?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: writer.write(\".\");\n<<<explanation>>>: To add a period at the end of the file, you should use PrintWriter.write with a period character (\".\") as the string. This will add a period at the end of the file.\n\nQuestion: How can I add a newline character at the end of the file?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: writer.write(\"\\n\");\n<<<explanation>>>: To add a newline character at the end of the file, you should use PrintWriter.write with a newline character (\"\\n\") as the string. This will add a newline character at the end of the file, which will create a new line.\n\nQuestion: How can I add a tab character at the end of the file?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: writer.write(\"\\t\");\n<<<explanation>>>: To add a tab character at the end of the file, you should use PrintWriter.write with a tab character (\"\\t\") as the string. This will add a tab character at the end of the file, which will create a tab space.\n\nQuestion: How can I add a custom string at the end of the file?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: writer.write(\"Custom String\");\n<<<ex"}
