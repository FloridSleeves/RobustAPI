The PhantomJS driver doesn't support the WebDriver's switchTo().window() method. This is because PhantomJS is a headless browser and doesn't have a concept of windows or tabs.\n\nTo handle multiple windows in PhantomJS, you can use the `executeScript` method to execute JavaScript code that opens a new window and returns the window handle. You can then switch to this new window using the `switchTo().window()` method.\n\nHere's an example of how you can modify your code:\n\n```java\n// Open a new window and switch to it\nString newWindowHandle = (String) ((JavascriptExecutor) driver).executeScript(\"window.open('');\");\ndriver.switchTo().window(newWindowHandle);\n\n// Now you can interact with the new window\nWebElement txtUsername = driver.findElement(By.id(\"it_C_C5\"));\ntxtUsername.sendKeys(\"sreenis\");\n\n// And so on...\n```\n\nIn this code, `executeScript` is used to open a new window and return its handle. This handle is then used to switch to the new window using `switchTo().window()`.\n\nPlease note that this solution will only work with PhantomJS, as other browsers (like Firefox or Chrome) support window switching.\n\nI hope this helps you in your testing. Let me know if you have any further questions.\n\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n```java\n// Open a new window and switch to it\nString newWindowHandle = (String) ((JavascriptExecutor) driver).executeScript(\"window.open('');\");\ndriver.switchTo().window(newWindowHandle);\n\n// Now you can interact with the new window\nWebElement txtUsername = driver.findElement(By.id(\"it_C_C5\"));\ntxtUsername.sendKeys(\"sreenis\");\n\n// And so on...\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION\nThis code uses the `executeScript` method to open a new window and return its handle.
