The \"\\n\" is used to create a new line after each entry. The write method is used to write the string to the file. The close method is used to close the PrintWriter.\n\nA: Here is the code you need:\npublic void checkCredentials() {\n    try {\n        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(new File(\"accounts.txt\")));\n        String line;\n        String username = \"\";\n        String password = \"\";\n        while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n            if (line.startsWith(\"usrnm:\")) {\n                username = line.substring(6); // get the part after \"usrnm:\"\n            } else if (line.startsWith(\"pswrd:\")) {\n                password = line.substring(6); // get the part after \"pswrd:\"\n            }\n        }\n        br.close();\n        System.out.println(\"username: \" + username);\n        System.out.println(\"password: \" + password);\n    } catch (Exception ex) {\n        ex.printStackTrace();\n    }\n}\n\nThis code reads the file line by line. If a line starts with \"usrnm:\", it sets the username variable to the part of the line after \"usrnm:\". If a line starts with \"pswrd:\", it sets the password variable to the part of the line after \"pswrd:\". After reading the file, it prints the username and password.\n\nA: Here is the code you need:\npublic void checkCredentials() {\n    try {\n        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(new File(\"accounts.txt\")));\n        String line;\n        String username = \"\";\n        String password = \"\";\n        while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n            if (line.startsWith(\"usrnm:\")) {\n                username = line.substring(6); // get the part after \"usrnm:\"\n            } else if (line.startsWith(\"pswrd:\")) {\n                password = line.substring(6); // get the part after \"pswrd:\"\n            }\n        }\n        br.close();\n        System.out.println(\"username: \" + username);\n        System.out.println(\"password: \" + password);\n    } catch (Exception ex) {\n        ex.printStackTrace();\n    }\n}\n\nThis code reads the file line by line.
