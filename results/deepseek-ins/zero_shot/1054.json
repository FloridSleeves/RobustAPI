The first call to nextToken() will return the first token (name) and the second call to nextToken() will return the second token (description). We are also using trim() to remove any leading or trailing spaces.\n```\n\nQuestion: How to update a MySQL table using JDBC?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Statement, PreparedStatement\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nString query = \"UPDATE item_list SET name = ?, description = ? WHERE id = ?\";\nPreparedStatement pstmt = connection.prepareStatement(query);\npstmt.setString(1, name);\npstmt.setString(2, description);\npstmt.setInt(3, id);\nint rowsUpdated = pstmt.executeUpdate();\nif (rowsUpdated > 0) {\n    System.out.println(\"An existing record was updated successfully!\");\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: We are using a PreparedStatement to update the MySQL table. The '?' are placeholders for the values we want to update. We then set the values using the setString() and setInt() methods. The executeUpdate() method is used to execute the update query and return the number of rows updated.\n```\n\nQuestion: How to read a MySQL table using JDBC?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Statement, ResultSet\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nString query = \"SELECT * FROM item_list\";\nStatement stmt = connection.createStatement();\nResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(query);\nwhile (rs.next()) {\n    String name = rs.getString(\"name\");\n    String description = rs.getString(\"description\");\n    int id = rs.getInt(\"id\");\n    System.out.println(\"Name: \" + name);\n    System.out.println(\"Description: \" + description);\n    System.out.println(\"ID: \" + id);\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: We are using a Statement to execute a SQL query and get a ResultSet. The ResultSet is a cursor that points to the result set of a SQL query. We then use the getString(), getInt() methods to get the values from the ResultSet. We loop through the ResultSet using the next() method and print out the values.\n```\n\nQuestion: How to insert a record into a MySQL table using JDBC?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Statement, PreparedStatement\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nString query = \"INSERT INTO item_list (name, description) VALUES (?, ?)\";\nPreparedStatement pstmt = connection.prepareStatement(query);\npstmt.setString(1, name);\npstmt.setString(2, description);\nint rowsInserted = pstmt.executeUpdate();\nif (rowsInserted > 0) {\n    System.out.println(\"A new record was inserted successfully!\");\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: We are using a PreparedStatement to insert a record into the MySQL table. The '?' are placeholders for the values we want to insert. We then set the values using the setString() method. The executeUpdate() method is used to execute the insert query and return the number of rows inserted.\n```\n\nQuestion: How to delete a record from a MySQL table using JDBC?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Statement, PreparedStatement\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nString query = \"DELETE FROM item_list WHERE id = ?\";\nPreparedStatement pstmt = connection.prepareStatement(query);\npstmt.setInt(1, id);\nint rowsDeleted = pstmt.executeUpdate();\nif (rowsDeleted > 0) {\n    System.out.println(\"A record was deleted successfully!\");\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: We are using a PreparedStatement to delete a record from the MySQL table.
