Here is a sample code snippet:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.*;\nimport java.util.stream.*;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Set<Integer> intSet = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5));\n        Set<String> strSet = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\"));\n        Set<Long> longSet = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(1L, 2L, 3L, 4L, 5L));\n\n        System.out.println(joinSets(\"@\", intSet, strSet, longSet));\n    }\n\n    public static <T> String joinSets(String delimiter, Set<T>... sets) {\n        return Arrays.stream(sets)\n            .flatMap(set -> set.stream().map(Object::toString))\n            .collect(Collectors.joining(delimiter));\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the `joinSets` function, we use `varargs` to accept any number of `Set` objects. We then use `Stream.of` to convert the varargs into a `Stream` of `Set` objects. From there, we use `flatMap` to transform each `Set` into a `Stream` of its elements. We then use `map` to convert each element to a `String`. Finally, we use `Collectors.joining` to join all the `String`s together with the specified delimiter.\n\nThis code will print: `1@2@3@4@5@a@b@c@d@e@1@2@3@4@5`.\n\nNote: This code assumes that the elements of the sets can be converted to `String`s. If this is not the case, you will need to add some additional type checking.\n\nAlso, this code uses Java 8's `Stream API`, so it won't work in Java 7 or earlier.\n\nThis solution is generic and can handle any type of set, as long as the elements of the set can be converted to `String`.\n\nI hope this helps you. Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\nAnswer:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.*;\nimport java.util.stream.*;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Set<Integer> intSet = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5));\n        Set<String> strSet = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\"));\n        Set<Long> longSet = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(1L, 2L, 3L, 4L, 5L));\n\n        System.out.println(joinSets(\"@\", intSet, strSet, longSet));\n    }\n\n    public static <T> String joinSets(String delimiter, Set<T>... sets) {\n        return Arrays.stream(sets)\n            .flatMap(set -> set.stream().map(Object::toString))\n            .collect(Collectors.joining(delimiter));\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis function uses Java's `Stream API` to convert the sets into a `Stream` of `String`s, then join them together with the specified delimiter. The `flatMap` function is used to transform each set into a `Stream` of its elements, and the `map` function is used to convert each element to a `String`. The `Collectors.joining` function is then used to join all the `String`s together with the specified delimiter.\n\nThis solution is generic and can handle any type of set, as long as the elements of the set can be converted to `String`. If this is not the case, you will need to add some additional type checking.\n\nAlso, this solution uses Java 8's `Stream API`, so it won't work in Java 7 or earlier.\n\nI hope this helps you.
