The key is a String and the value is the 2D array. We then use the get method to retrieve the 2D array we want to use.\n\n\nA: You can use a Map to store your 2D arrays. The key is a String and the value is the 2D array. Then you can use the get method to retrieve the 2D array you want to use.\nHere is an example:\nMap<String, int[][]> map = new HashMap<>();\nmap.put(\"array1\", new int[][] {{}});\nmap.put(\"array2\", new int[][] {{}});\n//...\nint[][] arrayToBeInvokedWith = map.get(arrayToBeInvokedWith);\nmethod(arrayToBeInvokedWith);\n\nThis way, you can easily switch between different 2D arrays by just changing the key in the get method.\n\nA: You can use a Map to store your arrays and then use the get method to retrieve the array you want to use.
