Another metric might return 10 timestamp values which may be matching with previous metric or not.So I need to generate a csv like below:tmestamp,metric1,metric2,tmetric3\\n0,1,,2\\n1,,2,\\n2,1,3,6\\n3,5,5, \\n4,,,5\\nThe value returned from the query might be more than 10000 datapoints.

The code uses a HashMap to store the data points for each metric. The keys of the HashMap are the metric names and the values are lists of DataPoint objects.\n\nThe code creates a FileWriter to write the CSV data. It then iterates over the keys of the HashMap (which are the metric names), and for each key, it creates a MetricMap object with the metric name and the timestamp of the DataPoint. It then uses the metricMaps HashMap to get the value of the DataPoint for the current metric and timestamp. If the value exists, it is appended to the CSV file; if not, an empty string is appended.\n\nThe code uses a for loop to iterate over the metric names, and for each metric name, it creates a MetricMap object with the metric name and the timestamp of the DataPoint. It then uses the metricMaps HashMap to get the value of the DataPoint for the current metric and timestamp. If the value exists, it is appended to the CSV file; if not, an empty string is appended.\n\nThe code then flushes and closes the FileWriter.\n\nThe code assumes that the DataPoint objects are ordered by timestamp. If the DataPoint objects are not ordered by timestamp, the code will not match the timestamps correctly.\n\nIf you have a large number of DataPoint objects, you may want to consider using a Spark cluster to process the data. Spark can handle large datasets and can be used to process the data in parallel. You would need to modify the code to use Spark to process the data and write the CSV file.\n\nPlease note that the code you provided does not include the MetricMap class. You would need to define this class to use the code as is. The MetricMap class should include fields for the metric name and timestamp, and methods for getting and setting these fields.\n\nI hope this helps. If you have any other questions, please let me know.\n\nAnswer: The code you provided is a Java program that fetches data from KairosDB and writes it to a CSV file.
