I am using Tomcat6.0 . Also checked server log ..but values r not getting printed on any log.Can any1 tell me how to print values using System.out.println() / java.util.Logger on console?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: System.out.println()\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nPrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"log.txt\", \"UTF-8\");\nwriter.println(\"Hello, World!\");\nwriter.close();\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: This code will print \"Hello, World!\" to a file named \"log.txt\" in the same directory as your program. If the file does not exist, it will be created. If it does exist, it will be overwritten.\n\nNote: You need to import java.io.PrintWriter and java.io.FileOutputStream to use PrintWriter.\n\nIf you want to print to the console, you can use System.out.println().\n\n```java\nSystem.out.println(\"Hello, World!\");\n```\n\nThis will print \"Hello, World!\" to the console.\n\nIf you want to use java.util.Logger, you can do something like this:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.logging.Logger;\n\npublic class Main {\n    private static final Logger LOGGER = Logger.getLogger(Main.class.getName());\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        LOGGER.info(\"Hello, World!\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis will print \"Hello, World!\" to the console. The message will be prefixed with the name of the logger, which in this case is \"Main\".\n\nPlease note that the System.out.println() and java.util.Logger methods are not the same as writing to a log file. They are used for debugging and logging information to the console. If you want to write to a log file, you should use PrintWriter or a logging library like Log4j.\n\nAlso, remember to handle exceptions when working with file I/O. For example, you should close the PrintWriter in a finally block to ensure that the file is properly closed.\n\n```java\nPrintWriter writer = null;\ntry {\n    writer = new PrintWriter(\"log.txt\", \"UTF-8\");\n    writer.println(\"Hello, World!\");\n} catch (FileNotFoundException | UnsupportedEncodingException ex) {\n    // handle exception\n} finally {\n    if (writer != null) {\n        writer.close();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code will ensure that the file is properly closed even if an exception is thrown.\n\nIf you want to print to the NetBeans console, you can use System.out.println(). However, NetBeans may not display the console output if the application is running in a headless environment (like a server). If you want to print to the NetBeans console, you should run your application in a desktop environment.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
