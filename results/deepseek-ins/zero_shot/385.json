The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:\n\nEach number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones.\n\nSo, instead of calculating fibnew and fibnext as (fibn - 1) + (fibn - 2) and (nextfib - 1) + (nextfib - 2), respectively, you should calculate them as arr.get(i) + arr.get(i - 1) and arr.get(i + 1) + arr.get(i), respectively.\nHere's the corrected code:\npublic class ArrayCheck {\n    /**\n     * Tests if the given array is a part of the Fibonacci sequence.\n     *\n     * @param arr array to be tested\n     * @return true if the elements are part of the fibonacci sequence\n     */\n    public boolean isFibonacci(ArrayList<Integer> arr) {\n        // check if array exists\n        if (arr.size() == 0)\n            return false;\n        // check if array is bigger than 3\n        if (arr.size() < 3)\n            return false;\n        // check for the start sequence of 0, 1, 1\n        else if (arr.get(0) == 0 && arr.get(1) == 1 && arr.get(2) == 1)\n            return true;\n        // check every number in array\n        for (int i = 0; i < arr.size() - 2; i++) {\n            // check if i >= 2 is fib\n            if (i >= 2) {\n                int fibnew = arr.get(i) + arr.get(i - 1);\n               "}
