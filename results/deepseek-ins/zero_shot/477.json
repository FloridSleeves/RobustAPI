It provides methods to read and write image data. The ImageIO class is used to read and write images in various formats. The ImageReader class is used to read image data from an input stream. The Graphics2D class is used to draw images on a BufferedImage. The drawImage method is used to resize an image by sub-sampling.\n\nNote: This code assumes that the input image is a JPEG. If you want to resize other image formats, you need to replace \"jpg\" with the appropriate format name.\n\nAlso, this code does not handle the case where there are no ImageReader instances for the specified format. You may want to add error handling code to handle this case.\n\nThis code does not handle the case where the input image is larger than the output image. You may want to add error handling code to handle this case.\n\nThis code does not handle the case where the input image has a different aspect ratio than the output image. You may want to add code to handle this case.\n\nThis code does not handle the case where the input image is not a valid image. You may want to add error handling code to handle this case.\n\nThis code does not handle the case where the output image cannot be written. You may want to add error handling code to handle this case.\n\nThis code does not handle the case where the input image is a GIF and the output image is a PNG. You may want to add code to handle this case.\n\nThis code does not handle the case where the input image is a PNG and the output image is a GIF. You may want to add code to handle this case.\n\nThis code does not handle the case where the input image is a PNG and the output image is a JPEG. You may want to add code to handle this case.\n\nThis code does not handle the case where the input image is a JPEG and the output image is a PNG.
