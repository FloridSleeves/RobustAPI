Then we set the visibility of the ImageViews. img1 is visible by default, img2 and img3 are invisible.\n\nNext, we create a Handler to post a Runnable after a certain delay. The Runnable will change the visibility of the ImageViews.\n\n<<<api>>>: Handler\n<<<code>>>: new Handler().postDelayed(new Runnable() {\n    @Override\n    public void run() {\n        if (img1.getVisibility() == View.VISIBLE) {\n            img1.setVisibility(View.INVISIBLE);\n            img2.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);\n        } else if (img2.getVisibility() == View.VISIBLE) {\n            img2.setVisibility(View.INVISIBLE);\n            img3.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);\n        } else if (img3.getVisibility() == View.VISIBLE) {\n            img3.setVisibility(View.INVISIBLE);\n            img1.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);\n        }\n    }\n}, 500);\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The Handler's postDelayed method takes a Runnable and a delay in milliseconds. The Runnable is run after the delay. In this case, it changes the visibility of the ImageViews. If img1 is visible, it sets img1 to invisible and img2 to visible. If img2 is visible, it sets img2 to invisible and img3 to visible. If img3 is visible, it sets img3 to invisible and img1 to visible. The delay is 500 milliseconds (half a second), so the images change every half second.\n\nThis will create an infinite loop of images changing every half second.\n\nPlease note that this code should be placed in the onCreate method of your Activity.\n\nAlso, make sure to replace R.id.img1, R.id.img2, and R.id.img3 with the actual ids of your ImageViews in your layout file.\n\nThis code assumes that you have imported the necessary classes (ImageView, View, and Handler) at the top of your file.\n\nIf you want to stop the animation, you can call the removeCallbacks method on the Handler. For example:\n\n<<<api>>>: Handler.removeCallbacks\n<<<code>>>: myHandler.removeCallbacks(null);\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The removeCallbacks method removes all Runnables from the message queue associated with the Handler. If you pass null, it removes all Runnables.\n\nPlease note that this code will not work if you try to call it before the onCreate method has been called.\n\nI hope this helps, and let me know if you have any other questions.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n\n\nA: You can use a Timer and TimerTask to achieve this.\nHere is a simple example:\nFirst, declare a Timer and TimerTask:\nprivate Timer timer;\nprivate TimerTask task;\n\nThen, in your onCreate() method, initialize the Timer and TimerTask:\ntimer = new Timer();\ntask = new TimerTask() {\n    @Override\n    public void run() {\n        runOnUiThread(new Runnable() {\n            @Override\n            public void run() {\n                if (img1.getVisibility() == View.VISIBLE) {\n                    img1.setVisibility(View.INVISIBLE);\n                    img2.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);\n                } else if (img2.getVisibility() == View.VISIBLE) {"}
