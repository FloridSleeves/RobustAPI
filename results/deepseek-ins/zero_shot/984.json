In this case, we are converting the string representation of the user's answer into a sequence of bytes which is then fed into the ByteArrayInputStream. The ByteArrayInputStream is then set as the System.in using System.setIn. This allows the System.in to be redirected to the test, allowing us to simulate user input.\n\nThe System.setIn(bis) line of code is used to redirect the System.in to the ByteArrayInputStream which is fed with the data.getBytes(). This allows us to simulate user input.\n\nThe ByteArrayInputStream bis = new ByteArrayInputStream(data.getBytes()); line of code is used to create a new ByteArrayInputStream which is fed with the data.getBytes(). This allows us to simulate user input.\n\nThe String data = sb.toString(); line of code is used to convert the StringBuilder sb into a String. This is done so that the data can be converted into bytes using the String.getBytes() method.\n\nThe System.setIn(bis) line of code is used to set the System.in to the ByteArrayInputStream bis. This allows us to simulate user input.\n\nThe ByteArrayInputStream bis = new ByteArrayInputStream(data.getBytes()); line of code is used to create a new ByteArrayInputStream which is fed with the data.getBytes(). This allows us to simulate user input.\n\nThe String data = sb.toString(); line of code is used to convert the StringBuilder sb into a String. This is done so that the data can be converted into bytes using the String.getBytes() method.\n\nThe System.setIn(bis) line of code is used to set the System.in to the ByteArrayInputStream bis. This allows us to simulate user input.\n\nThe ByteArrayInputStream bis = new ByteArrayInputStream(data.getBytes()); line of code is used to create a new ByteArrayInputStream which is fed with the data.getBytes(). This allows us to simulate user input.\n\nThe String data = sb.toString(); line of code is used to convert the StringBuilder sb into a String. This is done so that the data can be converted into bytes using the String.getBytes() method.\n\nThe System.setIn(bis) line of code is used to set the System.in to the ByteArrayInputStream bis.
