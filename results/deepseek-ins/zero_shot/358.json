In Java, raw types are not allowed. You should use the generic type instead.\n\n<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: Iterator<Integer> iterator = list.iterator();\nInteger next = iterator.next();\n\n<<<explanation>>>: Here, we are using a generic type Iterator<Integer> instead of raw type Iterator. This way, we are specifying that the iterator will only return Integer objects.\n\n\nA: The error is occurring because you are trying to use a raw type. In Java, raw types are not allowed.

You should use Iterator<Integer> instead.\nRaw types are not type-safe. They do not provide any compile-time checking to ensure that you are only calling methods that are applicable to the type of object you are using.\nHere is how you should use it:\nIterator<Integer> iterator = list.iterator();\nInteger next = iterator.next();\n\nThis way, you are specifying that the iterator will only return Integer objects.\n\nA: The error is because you are using raw type Iterator.
