Here is an example:\n\n<<<api>>>: CipherOutputStream\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nCipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES\");\ncipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);\nOutputStream out = new CipherOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(file, true), cipher);\n```\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The CipherOutputStream allows you to write data to an output stream, which is encrypted using the specified cipher. The 'true' parameter in the FileOutputStream constructor means that the file will be opened for appending.\n\nHowever, you should be aware that the CipherOutputStream does not support seek operations. This means that you cannot directly append to the middle of the file. Instead, you will need to read the entire file, decrypt it, append your data, and then re-encrypt it. This can be inefficient if the file is large.\n\nIf you control the size of the output data and ensure that it is divisible by the block size of the cipher (16 bytes for AES), you can use the NoPadding option. This will allow you to append data without worrying about padding bytes. However, be aware that this will mean that the size of your data will not be a multiple of the block size, which could lead to problems if you need to decrypt the data later.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is possible to append to an AES encrypted file without decrypting it every time, you will need to consider the trade-offs and potential issues.\n\nPlease note that this answer is based on the assumption that you are using the AES cipher. If you are using a different cipher, the process may be different.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
