This is causing the Iterator to skip the next element in the HashMap.\n\nTo fix this, you should create a new Iterator for each loop iteration. Here is the corrected code:\n\n```java\nvoid load() {\n    int i = 0;\n    for (String key : set) {\n        System.out.println(\"Book\" + (i + 1) + \"\\n\");\n        Books b = hashmap.get(key);\n        System.out.println(b.toString());\n        i++;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this corrected code, a new Iterator is created for each loop iteration. This ensures that the correct key is used to get the corresponding value from the HashMap.\n\nAlso, you don't need the `Iterator<String> iter = set.iterator();` line in the corrected code. The `for-each` loop automatically creates an Iterator for you.\n\nThis should fix your issue.\n\n```java\nvoid load() {\n    int i = 0;\n    for (String key : set) {\n        System.out.println(\"Book\" + (i + 1) + \"\\n\");\n        Books b = hashmap.get(key);\n        System.out.println(b.toString());\n        i++;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code will now correctly print out all the books in your HashMap.\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n```java\nvoid load() {\n    int i = 0;\n    for (String key : set) {\n        System.out.println(\"Book\" + (i + 1) + \"\\n\");\n        Books b = hashmap.get(key);\n        System.out.println(b.toString());\n        i++;\n    }\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION\nThe `load()` method in your code is used to print all the books that have been registered in the HashMap. The problem you are experiencing is that it only prints the details of the last book that was registered, because the Iterator is not being reset for each loop iteration.\n\nTo fix this, you should create a new Iterator for each loop iteration. This can be done by using the enhanced for-each loop, which automatically creates an Iterator for you. Here is the corrected code:\n\n```java\nvoid load() {\n    int i = 0;\n    for (String key : set) {\n        System.out.println(\"Book\" + (i + 1) + \"\\n\");\n        Books b = hashmap.get(key);\n        System.out.println(b.toString());\n        i++;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this corrected code, the enhanced for-each loop automatically creates an Iterator for you. This ensures that the correct key is used to get the corresponding value from the HashMap. The Iterator is not being reset for each loop iteration, so it will correctly iterate over all the keys in the HashMap.\n\nThis should fix your issue.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n"}
