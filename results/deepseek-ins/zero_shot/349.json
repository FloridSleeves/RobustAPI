NOTE : At first i tried using ImageIcon to add to JPanel but it could not work hence i found this solution which lead to my current problem.

It returns the next element in the iteration and throws NoSuchElementException if there are no more elements in the iteration.\n\n\nA: The error message \"Numbers of source Raster bands and source color space components do not match\" is usually thrown when you try to read an image with ImageIO.read() and the image has a different number of bands than what the image format expects.\nIn your case, it seems like the image you're trying to read is a grayscale image, but ImageIO.read() is trying to read it as a color image.\nYou can check the number of bands in your image using ImageIO.read().getNumBands(). If it returns 1, then the image is grayscale. If it returns 3, then the image is color.\nIf your image is grayscale and you're still getting this error, you can try using ImageIO.read().getColorModel().getNumComponents() to check the number of color components. For a grayscale image, this should return 1.\nIf your image is color and you're still getting this error, it might be because the image format you're trying to read it as doesn't support color images.\nIf none of these solutions work, you might want to try using a different image format that supports color images.\n\nA: The error message \"Numbers of source Raster bands and source color space components do not match\" is usually thrown when you try to read an image with ImageIO.read() and the image has a different number of bands than what the image format expects.\nIn your case, it seems like the image you're trying to read is a grayscale image, but ImageIO.read() is trying to read it as a color image.\nYou can check the number of bands in your image using ImageIO.read().getNumBands().
