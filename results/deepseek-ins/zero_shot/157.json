So that the client code should see EOF once 100th byte is reached.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream(\"file.txt\");\ninputStream.skip(100); // Skip first 100 bytes\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[100]; // Read next 100 bytes\ninputStream.read(buffer);\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: In this code, we first create a FileInputStream to read from a file. We then skip the first 100 bytes using the skip() method. After that, we create a buffer of size 100 and read the next 100 bytes into this buffer using the read() method. The read() method will return -1 when it reaches the end of the stream, indicating that the end of the file has been reached.\n```\n\nQuestion: How can I create a BufferedInputStream to read from a file?:\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: BufferedInputStream\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nBufferedInputStream bufferedInputStream = new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(\"file.txt\"));\nint i;\nwhile((i=bufferedInputStream.read()) != -1){\n    System.out.print((char)i);\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: In this code, we create a BufferedInputStream by wrapping a FileInputStream around it. The BufferedInputStream buffers the input data, which can improve the performance of the read() method. We then read the file byte by byte and print each byte to the console. The read() method returns -1 when it reaches the end of the stream, indicating that the end of the file has been reached.\n```\n\nQuestion: How can I create a BufferedReader to read from a file?:\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: BufferedReader\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"file.txt\"));\nString line;\nwhile((line=bufferedReader.readLine()) != null){\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: In this code, we create a BufferedReader by wrapping a FileReader around it. The BufferedReader buffers the input data, which can improve the performance of the readLine() method. We then read the file line by line and print each line to the console. The readLine() method returns null when it reaches the end of the stream, indicating that the end of the file has been reached.\n```\n\nQuestion: How can I create a FileOutputStream to write to a file?:\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: FileOutputStream\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nFileOutputStream fileOutputStream = new FileOutputStream(\"file.txt\");\nString text = \"Hello, World!\";\nbyte[] bytes = text.getBytes();\nfileOutputStream.write(bytes);\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: In this code, we create a FileOutputStream to write to a file. We then convert a string to a byte array using the getBytes() method and write this byte array to the file using the write() method.\n```\n\nQuestion: How can I create a BufferedOutputStream to write to a file?:\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: BufferedOutputStream\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nBufferedOutputStream bufferedOutputStream = new BufferedOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(\"file.txt\"));\nString text = \"Hello, World!\";\nbyte[] bytes = text.getBytes();\nbufferedOutputStream.write(bytes);\nbufferedOutputStream.flush();\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: In this code, we create a BufferedOutputStream by wrapping a FileOutputStream around it. The BufferedOutputStream buffers the output data, which can improve the performance of the write() method. We then convert a string to a byte array using the getBytes() method and write this byte array to the file using the write() method. Finally, we flush the buffered output stream to ensure that all data is written to the file.\n```\n\nQuestion: How can I create a FileWriter to write to a file?:\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: FileWriter\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nFileWriter fileWriter = new FileWriter(\"file.txt\");\nString text = \"Hello, World!\";\nfileWriter.write(text);\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: In this code, we create a FileWriter to write to a file. We then write a string to the file using the"}
