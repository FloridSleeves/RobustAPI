The output stream in this case is a FileOutputStream which writes the bytes to a file on disk. The while loop continues until the end of the input stream is reached (-1 is returned by the read method). After the loop, the FileOutputStream is closed to free up resources. The BufferedInputStream is also closed to free up resources.\n\n$API\nInputStream.read, FileOutputStream.write\n\n\nA: You can use a FileOutputStream to write the data to a file.
