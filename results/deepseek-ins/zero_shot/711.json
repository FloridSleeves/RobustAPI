It writes each line to a new file using PrintWriter. The files are named \"output1.txt\", \"output2.txt\", etc. The program splits the file into 2000 rows each. The count variable keeps track of the number of lines written to each file. When the count reaches 2000, the program closes the current file and opens a new one. The fileCount variable keeps track of the number of files created.\n\nNote: Make sure to handle exceptions properly in your production code. The code above is a basic example and does not include exception handling.\n\nAlso, ensure that the file paths (\"input.txt\" and \"output*.txt\") match your actual file paths.\n\nThis code assumes that the file is not too large to fit into memory. If the file is too large, you might need to use a different approach, such as reading and writing the file in chunks.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n\nPlease note that the above code is a simple example and might not be suitable for a production environment.
