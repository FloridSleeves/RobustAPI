For reading a file I know you can use Scanner and read it and then print it. However reading a file and then printing it in a new format, like double space, indents, basically any spacing issues, is that also considered reading it or is it writing it? From my understanding of what my teacher has taught me, is that writing overwrites the original document and replaces it. Also how does one use the PrintWriter command? I have never seen this before in my class nor have read about it in my textbook but its on my test according to my teacher. Could someone give an explanation and an example about it? I read this site http://www.caveofprogramming.com/frontpage/articles/java/java-file-reading-and-writing-files-in-java/ on writing files, but it uses FileWriter, which I'm assuming takes the place of scanner?

Is that right?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nPrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"output.txt\", \"UTF-8\");\nwriter.println(\"Hello, World!\");\nwriter.close();\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: This code creates a new file named \"output.txt\" and writes the string \"Hello, World!\" to it. The \"UTF-8\" argument specifies the character encoding to use.\n\nFor reading a file, you can use a Scanner in the same way as you would use a Scanner to read from the keyboard. Here's an example:\n\n```java\nScanner scanner = new Scanner(new File(\"input.txt\"));\nwhile (scanner.hasNextLine()) {\n    String line = scanner.nextLine();\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\nscanner.close();\n```\n\nThis code reads the file \"input.txt\" line by line and prints each line to the console. The `hasNextLine` method checks if there are more lines in the file, and the `nextLine` method reads the next line.\n\nIf you want to read a file and then print it in a new format, like double space, indents, you would still use a Scanner to read the file, but then you would manually add the spacing or formatting you want after you read the file. Here's an example:\n\n```java\nScanner scanner = new Scanner(new File(\"input.txt\"));\nwhile (scanner.hasNextLine()) {\n    String line = scanner.nextLine();\n    System.out.println(\"  \" + line);  // Double space the line\n}\nscanner.close();\n```\n\nThis code does the same thing as the previous example, but it also adds two spaces before each line, so each line in the output is indented by two spaces.\n\nI hope this helps clarify things for you. Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
