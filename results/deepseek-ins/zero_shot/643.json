DocsCollection.put(2,\"foo.txt,hello.txt\"); Thanks, in advance\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Map.get\n<<<code>>>: DocsCollection.get(1)\n<<<explanation>>>: This will return the value associated with the key 1 in the HashMap DocsCollection. If the key does not exist, it will return null.\n\nQuestion: How can I increment the counter in the key every time I find a specific word in a file?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Map.put\n<<<code>>>: DocsCollection.put(DocsCollection.get(1) + 1, \"foo.txt\");\n<<<explanation>>>: This will increment the value associated with the key 1 in the HashMap DocsCollection by 1. If the key does not exist, it will create a new entry with the key 1 and value 1.\n\nQuestion: How can I add the new file in the value every time I find a specific word in a file?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Map.put\n<<<code>>>: DocsCollection.put(DocsCollection.get(1), DocsCollection.get(DocsCollection.get(1)) + \",foo.txt\");\n<<<explanation>>>: This will append the string \"foo.txt\" to the value associated with the key 1 in the HashMap DocsCollection. If the key does not exist, it will create a new entry with the key 1 and value \"foo.txt\".\n\nPlease note that the key in the HashMap is an Integer and the value is a String. The key represents the count of the specific word found in the files and the value represents the names of the files where the word was found.\n\nI hope this helps. Let me know if you have any further questions.\n\n\nA: You can use the compute() method of the HashMap. This method allows you to update the value associated with a key in a single atomic operation.\nHere is an example:\nDocsCollection.compute(1, (key, value) -> value == null ? \"foo.txt\" : value + \",foo.txt\");\n\nThis code will increment the count associated with the key 1 and append \"foo.txt\" to the list of files. If the key does not exist, it will create a new entry with the key 1 and value \"foo.txt\".\nIf you want to increment the count associated with the key 1, you can use:\nDocsCollection.compute(1, (key, value) -> value == null ? 1 : Integer.parseInt(value) + 1);\n\nThis code will increment the count associated with the key 1. If the key does not exist, it will create a new entry with the key 1 and value 1.\n\nA: You can use computeIfAbsent() method of HashMap. This method will compute the value for a key if it is not already present in the map.\nHere is an example:\nDocsCollection.computeIfAbsent(1, k -> \"foo.txt\");\n\nThis will add a new entry in the HashMap with key 1 and value \"foo.txt\". If the key 1 already exists, it will not change the value.\n\nIf you want to increment the count associated with the key 1, you can use:\nDocsCollection.compute(1, (k,v) -> v == null ? \"1\" : String.valueOf(Integer.parseInt(v) + 1));\n\nThis will increment the count associated with the key 1. If the key does not exist, it will create a new entry with the key 1 and value \"1\".\n\nIf you want to append the new file \"foo.txt\" to the value associated with the key 1, you can use:\nDocsCollection.compute(1, (k,v) -> v == null ? \"foo.txt\" : v + \",foo.txt\");\n\nThis will append \"foo.txt\" to the value associated with the key 1. If the key does not exist, it will create a new entry with the key 1 and value \"foo.txt\".\n\nA: You can use computeIfPresent() method of HashMap. This method will compute the value for a key if it is already present in the map.\nHere is an example:\nDocsCollection.computeIfPresent(1, (key, value) -> value + \",foo.txt\");\n\nThis will append \"foo.txt\" to the value associated with the key 1. If the key 1 is not present, it will not change the map"}
