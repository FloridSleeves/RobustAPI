In this case, we are using it to retrieve the value associated with the key \"orange\". The value is then parsed into an integer using Integer.parseInt.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the file \"fruit.txt\" is formatted such that each line contains a fruit name followed by a space and then the quantity of that fruit. The status is not considered in this code. If the status is also included in the file, it would need to be separated and parsed separately.\n\nAlso, this code does not handle cases where the fruit is not found in the file or where the quantity is not a valid integer. You would need to add error checking code to handle these cases.\n\nLastly, this code uses a while loop to read all lines from the file. If the file is large, this could cause memory issues. Consider using a try-with-resources statement or a BufferedReader to read the file.\n\nPlease note that this code uses the Java 8 Stream API to read the file and create the map. If you are using an older version of Java, you would need to use a different approach to read the file and create the map.\n\nPlease note that this code uses the Java 8 Stream API to read the file and create the map.
