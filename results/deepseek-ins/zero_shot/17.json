It should be called before findViewById() to avoid a NullPointerException.\n\nQuestion: will it overlap ? Timer-task VS handler VS alarm-manager:\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Handler\n<<<code>>>: handler = new Handler();\nhandler.postDelayed(runnable, 1000*60*10);\n<<<explanation>>>: Handlers are more reliable than timers or scheduling. They are used to schedule tasks to be performed at some point in the future. In your case, you are using a Handler to run your task every 10 minutes. This is a good approach as it ensures that your task is not only scheduled but also executed at the right time.\n\nQuestion: How to stop the handler from running ?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: handler.removeCallbacks(runnable);\n<<<code>>>: handler.removeCallbacks(runnable);\n<<<explanation>>>: This method removes all instances of the specified Runnable from the message queue. In your case, you are using the same Runnable object for scheduling and removing the task. If you want to stop the task, you should call this method.\n\nQuestion: How to ensure that only one instance of the handler runs at a time ?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Handler\n<<<code>>>: handler = new Handler();\n<<<explanation>>>: Handlers are designed to run tasks on the main thread of your application. If you create a new Handler in onCreate(), it will not interfere with other Handlers. The Handler will run tasks on the main thread and will not overlap with other tasks.\n\nQuestion: What is the best way to keep only a single Handler runs in background at a time ?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Handler\n<<<code>>>: handler = new Handler();\n<<<explanation>>>: You can create a single Handler object in your activity and use it to schedule your tasks. The Handler will ensure that your tasks are executed on the main thread and will not overlap with other tasks. You can use the postDelayed() method to schedule your tasks and the removeCallbacks() method to cancel them.\n\nQuestion: How to ensure that only one instance of the handler runs at a time ?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Handler\n<<<code>>>: handler = new Handler();\n<<<explanation>>>: Handlers are designed to run tasks on the main thread of your application.
