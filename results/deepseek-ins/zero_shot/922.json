The bytes are UTF-8 by default.\n\nQuestion: Is multithreading possible in a simple java server using tcp connection-oriented protocol?:\nAnswer: Yes, multithreading is possible in a simple java server using TCP connection-oriented protocol.\n\nAPI: ServerSocket, Socket, DataInputStream, DataOutputStream\nCODE: \n```java\nServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(1234);\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nDataInputStream dataInputStream = new DataInputStream(socket.getInputStream());\nDataOutputStream dataOutputStream = new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());\n\nThread thread = new Thread(new Runnable() {\n    public void run() {\n        String clientMessage = \"\";\n        while(!clientMessage.equals(\"exit\")){\n            try{\n                clientMessage = dataInputStream.readUTF();\n                System.out.println(\"Client says: \" + clientMessage);\n                dataOutputStream.writeUTF(\"Message received\");\n                dataOutputStream.flush();\n            }catch(IOException e){\n                e.printStackTrace();\n            }\n        }\n        try{\n            dataInputStream.close();\n            socket.close();\n        }catch(IOException e){\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n});\nthread.start();\n```\nEXPLANATION: In this example, a server is created using TCP connection-oriented protocol. A new thread is created for each client connection. The server listens for client messages and sends a response back to the client. The server can handle multiple clients at the same time thanks to multithreading.\n\nQuestion: What is the difference between TCP and UDP?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION\n\nAPI: None\nCODE: \n- TCP is connection-oriented, providing reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of bytes between applications running on hosts communicating via an IP network.\n- UDP is connectionless, providing unreliable datagrams of a stream of bytes to applications running on hosts communicating via an IP network.\nEXPLANATION: The main difference between TCP and UDP lies in their delivery mechanisms. TCP provides a reliable connection-oriented service, ensuring that data is delivered in the correct order and without errors. UDP, on the other hand, provides a connectionless service, which means it does not guarantee the delivery of data packets. This makes UDP faster and more suitable for real-time applications.\n\nQuestion: What is the difference between blocking and non-blocking I/O?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION\n\nAPI: None\nCODE: \n- Blocking I/O: The process waits until the data is available before it proceeds.\n- Non-blocking I/O: The process does not wait for the data to be available before it proceeds.\nEXPLANATION: The main difference between blocking and non-blocking I/O lies in how they handle waiting for data. In blocking I/O, the process waits until the data is available before it proceeds. In non-blocking I/O, the process does not wait for the data to be available before it proceeds. This allows the process to continue executing other tasks while waiting for the data. This can lead to better performance and scalability.\n\nQuestion: What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous I/O?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION\n\nAPI: None\nCODE: \n- Synchronous I/O: The process waits for the I/O operation to complete before proceeding.\n- Asynchronous I/O: The process does not wait for the I/O operation to complete before proceeding.\nEXPLANATION: The main difference between synchronous and asynchronous I/O lies in how they handle the I/O operations. In synchronous I/O, the process waits for the I/O operation to"}
