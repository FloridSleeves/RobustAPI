In this case, we are writing the total, percentage, highest, lowest and grade to a text file named \"output.txt\". The \"UTF-8\" parameter is used to specify the character encoding.\n\nA: You are not actually reading the grades from the keyboard. You are just calling keyboard.nextDouble() once, which does not read the grades. You need to call it five times to read the five grades.\nHere is the corrected code:\nimport java.util.Scanner;\nimport java.io.PrintWriter;\nimport java.io.FileOutputStream;\nimport java.io.IOException;\n\npublic class BenefieldProgram4 {\n    public static void main(String[ ] args) {\n        Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);\n        System.out.println(\"Enter 5 Grades:\");\n        double a = keyboard.nextDouble();\n        double b = keyboard.nextDouble();\n        double c = keyboard.nextDouble();\n        double d = keyboard.nextDouble();\n        double e = keyboard.nextDouble();\n        keyboard.close();\n\n        double sum = a + b + c + d + e;\n        double avg = sum / 5;\n        double min = Math.min(Math.min(Math.min(Math.min(a, b), c), d), e);\n        double max = Math.max(Math.max(Math.max(Math.max(a, b), c), d), e);\n\n        String grade;\n        if (avg >= 90) {\n            grade = \"A\";\n        } else if (avg >= 80) {\n            grade = \"B\";\n        } else if (avg >= 70) {\n            grade = \"C\";\n        } else if (avg >= 60) {\n            grade = \"D\";\n        } else {\n            grade = \"F\";\n        }\n\n        try {\n            PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"output.txt\", \"UTF-8\");\n            writer.println(\"Total Score=: \" + sum);\n            writer.println(\"Percentage =: \" + avg);\n            writer.println(\"Highest Score= \" + max);\n            writer.println(\"Lowest Score= \" + min);\n            writer.println(\"Grade= \" + grade);\n            writer.close();\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            System.out.println(\"Error writing to file\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThis code reads the grades from the keyboard, calculates the total, average, minimum, and maximum grades, and determines the grade based on the average. It then writes these values and the grade to a text file named \"output.txt\". If there is an error writing to the file, it prints an error message to the console.\n\nA: You are not reading the grades from the keyboard.
