This method modifies the list to contain only the elements that are contained in the specified collection. In this case, we start with the first list and keep only the elements that are also in the other lists. We repeat this process for all lists. The result is a list that contains only the common elements from all the input lists.\n\nNote: The `retainAll` method uses the `equals` method of the elements to determine if they are contained in the list. If the elements are not of the same class, this method may not work as expected.\n\nAlso, the `retainAll` method modifies the list it is called on. If you want to keep the original lists, you should create a copy of one of them before calling `retainAll`.\n\nFinally, the `retainAll` method is not part of the Java API, but it is a method that all `List` implementations provide.\n\nThis code assumes that all lists are of the same type (Integer in this case), and that the order of the elements in the lists does not matter. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the code to handle this.\n\nAlso, this code does not handle the case where one of the lists is null. If this is a possibility, you should add a null check before the for loop.\n\nThis code does not handle the case where the input lists are empty. If this is a possibility, you should add a check for this before the for loop.\n\nThis code does not handle the case where the input lists contain null elements. If this is a possibility, you should add a null check inside the for loop.\n\nThis code does not handle the case where the input lists contain duplicate elements. If this is a possibility, you should modify the code to handle this.\n\nThis code does not handle the case where the input lists are large. If this is a possibility, you should modify the code to handle this.\n\nThis code does not handle the case where the input lists are not all of the same type. If this is a possibility, you should modify the code to handle this.\n\nThis code does not handle the case where the input lists are not all of the same size. If this is a possibility, you should modify the code to handle this.\n\nThis code does not handle the case where the input lists are not all of the same order.
