The selection argument is the SQL WHERE clause, and the selectionArgs is an array of values to replace the placeholders in the WHERE clause. The query method returns a Cursor object which can be used to iterate over the results.\n\nI hope this helps you to understand how to write a SQLite query to find all rows with a given group_id.\n\nA: Here is the SQLite query you need to use:\n\nString selection = \"word_group_id = ?\";\nString[] selectionArgs = new String[] { String.valueOf(id) };\n\nCursor cursor = db.query(\"Words\", null, selection, selectionArgs, null, null, null);\n\nExplanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*The \"Words\" is the name of the table you want to query.\n\n*The null in the second argument is used to select all columns from the table.\n\n*The \"word_group_id = ?\" is the selection criteria. The \"?\" is a placeholder for the actual value you want to match.\n\n*The selectionArgs array contains the actual value you want to match.\n\n*The other arguments are used for grouping, having, and ordering, which are not needed in this case.\n\n\nThis will return a Cursor that you can use to iterate over the results. Each row in the Cursor corresponds to a row in the \"Words\" table where the word_group_id matches the given id.\n\nA: You can use the following code to get the word and definition from the database:\n\nString selection = \"word_group_id = ?\";\nString[] selectionArgs = new String[] { String.valueOf(id) };\n\nCursor cursor = db.query(\"Words\", null, selection, selectionArgs, null, null, null);\n\nList<WordContainer> wordContainers = new ArrayList<>();\n\nif (cursor != null) {\n    cursor.moveToFirst();\n    while (!cursor.isAfterLast()) {\n        int wordId = cursor.getInt(cursor.getColumnIndex(\"ID\"));\n        String word = cursor.getString(cursor.getColumnIndex(\"Word\"));\n        String definition = cursor.getString(cursor.getColumnIndex(\"Definition\"));\n        WordContainer wordContainer = new WordContainer(wordId, word, definition);\n        wordContainers.add(wordContainer);\n        cursor.moveToNext();\n    }\n    cursor.close();\n}\n\nExplanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*The \"Words\" is the name of the table you want to query.\n\n*The null in the second argument is used to select all columns from the table.\n\n*The \"word_group_id = ?\" is the selection criteria. The \"?\" is a placeholder for the actual value you want to match.\n\n*The selectionArgs array contains the actual value you want to match.\n\n*The other arguments are used for grouping, having, and ordering, which are not needed in this case.\n\n*The cursor is then used to iterate over the results. For each row, the ID, word, and definition are extracted and a new WordContainer object is created and added to the list.\n\n*Finally, the cursor is closed.\n\n\nThis will return a List of WordContainer objects that you can use in your code. Each WordContainer object represents a row in the \"Words\" table where the word_group_id matches the given id.\n\nA: Here is the SQLite query you need to use:\n\nString selection = \"word_group_id = ?\";\nString[] selectionArgs = new String[] { String.valueOf(id) };\n\nCursor cursor = db.query(\"Words\", null, selection, selection"}
