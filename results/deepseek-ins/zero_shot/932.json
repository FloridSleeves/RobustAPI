This is not secure, but it's simple and can be used for educational purposes.\n\nAPI: XOR encryption and decryption\nCODE: \nString password = \"password\";\nbyte[] key = \"key\".getBytes();\nbyte[] passwordBytes = password.getBytes();\nbyte[] encryptedBytes = new byte[passwordBytes.length];\nfor (int i = 0; i < passwordBytes.length; i++) {\n    encryptedBytes[i] = (byte) (passwordBytes[i] ^ key[i % key.length]);\n}\nString encryptedPassword = new String(encryptedBytes);\n\n// To decrypt\nbyte[] decryptedBytes = new byte[passwordBytes.length];\nfor (int i = 0; i < passwordBytes.length; i++) {\n    decryptedBytes[i] = (byte) (encryptedBytes[i] ^ key[i % key.length]);\n}\nString decryptedPassword = new String(decryptedBytes);\n\nEXPLANATION: This code uses the XOR operation to encrypt and decrypt the password. The key is repeated until it matches the length of the password. The result is a simple form of encryption. Please note that this is not secure and should not be used for any real-world applications.\n\nNote: The XOR operation is vulnerable to frequency analysis attacks. It's also vulnerable to a key-recovery attack if the key is shorter than the password.\n\nFor a real-world application, you should use a secure encryption algorithm like AES.\n\nAPI: AES encryption and decryption\nCODE: \nString password = \"password\";\nbyte[] keyBytes = \"keykeykeykey\".getBytes(); // Must be 16 bytes\nbyte[] passwordBytes = password.getBytes();\n\nCipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES\");\nSecretKeySpec secretKey = new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, \"AES\");\ncipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secretKey);\nbyte[] encryptedBytes = cipher.doFinal(passwordBytes);\nString encryptedPassword = new String(encryptedBytes);\n\n// To decrypt\ncipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, secretKey);\nbyte[] decryptedBytes = cipher.doFinal(encryptedBytes);\nString decryptedPassword = new String(decryptedBytes);\n\nEXPLANATION: This code uses the AES encryption algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the password. The key must be 16 bytes long. The result is a secure form of encryption.\n\nNote: The AES algorithm is more secure than the XOR operation, but it's also more complex and computationally intensive.\n\nFor a real-world application, you should use a secure encryption algorithm like AES.\n\nAPI: BASE64 encoding and decoding\nCODE: \nString password = \"password\";\nbyte[] passwordBytes = password.getBytes();\nString encodedPassword = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(passwordBytes);\nbyte[] decodedBytes = Base64.getDecoder().decode(encodedPassword);\nString decodedPassword = new String(decodedBytes);\n\nEXPLANATION: This code uses Base64 encoding to convert the byte array into a string that can be stored in a database. The result is a secure form of encoding.\n\nNote: Base64 encoding is not secure by itself. It's often used as a wrapper for more secure encryption algorithms.\n\nFor a real-world application, you should use a secure encoding algorithm like Base64.\n\nAPI: MessageDigest for hashing\nCODE: \nString password = \"password\";\nMessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\");\nbyte[] hash = md.digest(password.getBytes());\nString has"}
