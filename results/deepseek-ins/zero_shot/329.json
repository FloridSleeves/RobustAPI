Improve this question                    From our application we fetch images (jpeg/png) from a third party service, after download we want to save these images as compressed.Can any one please guide how to compress images in Java ?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: $CODE\nIterator<Image> iterator = ImageIO.read(new File(\"image.jpg\"));\nBufferedImage image = iterator.next();\n\nByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();\nImageIO.write(image, \"jpg\", baos);\n\n//Compress the ByteArrayOutputStream\nbyte[] imageInByte = baos.toByteArray();\n\n//Now you can compress the imageInByte array\n\n<<<api>>>: ImageIO.read\n<<<code>>>: Iterator<Image> iterator = ImageIO.read(new File(\"image.jpg\"));\nBufferedImage image = iterator.next();\n\n<<<explanation>>>: This API is used to read the image from the file. It returns an iterator of images. In this case, we are assuming that the file contains multiple images. So, we are using the iterator.next() to get the first image from the iterator.\n\n<<<api>>>: ImageIO.write\n<<<code>>>: ImageIO.write(image, \"jpg\", baos);\n<<<explanation>>>: This API is used to write the image to an output stream. In this case, we are writing the image to a ByteArrayOutputStream.\n\nTo compress the image, you can use the following code:\n\n<<<api>>>: Compressing the image\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();\nDeflaterOutputStream dos = new DeflaterOutputStream(baos);\ndos.write(imageInByte);\ndos.close();\nbyte[] compressedImage = baos.toByteArray();\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: We are using the DeflaterOutputStream to compress the image. The compressed image is then returned as a byte array.\n\nPlease note that the compression ratio will depend on the quality of the image. You may need to experiment with different compression levels to get the best results.\n\nAlso, remember to handle exceptions properly in your code. The code snippet above does not include exception handling.\n\nThis is a basic example of how to compress an image in Java. There are many other libraries and methods you can use for more advanced image compression.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
