Thank in advance\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:\nYou can use StringTokenizer to separate the hours and minutes. Then, you can use a HashMap to group the hours with corresponding minutes. Here is a sample code:\n\n```java\nArrayList<String> train_schedule_time = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(\"8.2\", \"13.55\", \"0.45\"));\nHashMap<Integer, ArrayList<Float>> scheduleMap = new HashMap<>();\n\nfor (String time : train_schedule_time) {\n    StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(time, \".\");\n    int hour = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\n    float minute = Float.parseFloat(st.nextToken());\n\n    if (scheduleMap.containsKey(hour)) {\n        scheduleMap.get(hour).add(minute);\n    } else {\n        ArrayList<Float> minutesList = new ArrayList<>();\n        minutesList.add(minute);\n        scheduleMap.put(hour, minutesList);\n    }\n}\n\n// Now you can use scheduleMap to display in your ListView\n```\n\nIn this code, we first create a HashMap where the key is the hour and the value is an ArrayList of minutes. We then iterate over the train_schedule_time array and use StringTokenizer to separate the hour and minute. We then check if the hour already exists in the HashMap. If it does, we add the minute to the ArrayList for that hour. If it doesn't, we create a new ArrayList, add the minute to it, and put it in the HashMap with the hour as the key. Finally, we can use the scheduleMap to display the train schedule in your ListView.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the minutes are always two digits. If they can be more than two digits, you will need to adjust the code accordingly.\n```\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the minutes are always two digits.
