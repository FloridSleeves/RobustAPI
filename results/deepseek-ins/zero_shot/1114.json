This is because we are going to check if the first name of the user's input is in these strings.\n- I have added a `StringTokenizer` to split the user's input into the first name and the rest of the name.\n- I have changed the `if(name.hasNext())` to `if(name.isEmpty())`. This is because we want the program to stop when the user just hits \"enter\" without typing a name.\n- I have changed the `else` to `else if(male.contains(firstName))` and `else if(females.contains(firstName))`. This is because we want to check if the first name of the user's input is in the `male` or `females` string.\n- I have changed `System.out.println(scan.nextLine())` to `System.out.println(name)`. This is because we want to print the user's input without any changes.\n\nThis code will work as expected.\n\nNote: The `StringTokenizer` class is deprecated in Java 9 and removed in Java 11. You should use `String.split()` instead.\n\n```java\nString[] names = name.split(\" \");\nString firstName = names[0];\n```\n\nThis code will split the user's input into an array of strings and get the first element of the array.\n\n```java\nif(females.contains(firstName)) {\n    System.out.println(\"Ms. \" + name);\n}\nelse if(male.contains(firstName)) {\n    System.out.println(\"Mr. \" + name);\n}\nelse {\n    System.out.println(name);\n}\n```\n\nThis code will check if the first name is in the `females` or `male` string. If it is, it will print \"Ms.\" or \"Mr.\" before the user's input. If it is not, it will just print the user's input.\n\n```java\nif(name.isEmpty()) {\n    break;\n}\n```\n\nThis code will break the loop if the user just hits \"enter\" without typing a name.\n\n```java\nwhile(true) {\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nThis code will make the loop run indefinitely until the user hits \"enter\" without typing a name.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n"}
