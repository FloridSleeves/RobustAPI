I need to sort the values and retrieve the key of the first value after sorting.I did something like this Set<Integer> set = new TreeSet<>(map.values());.Now the values are sorted, How do I get the key of the first element in the sorted values.I will also welcome a better way of achieving this.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: $CODE:\nIterator<Integer> it = set.iterator();\nit.next();\nInteger firstValue = it.next();\nString key = Collections.max(map.entrySet(), Map.Entry.comparingByValue(firstValue)).getKey();\n$EXPLANATION:\nIn the above code, we first create an iterator for the set of values. We then call next() twice to skip the first value (which is the smallest in the set). The first value after sorting is stored in the variable firstValue. We then use the Collections.max() method to find the entry with the maximum value (which is the first value after sorting). We use Map.Entry.comparingByValue() to compare the values of the entries. The getKey() method is then called to get the key of the entry with the maximum value.\nThis code assumes that there is only one entry with the maximum value in the map. If there are multiple entries with the same maximum value, this code will only return the key of the first one it encounters.\n\nA: You can use the following code to get the key of the first value after sorting:\nInteger firstValue = new TreeSet<>(map.values()).first();\nString key = map.entrySet().stream()\n                .filter(e -> e.getValue().equals(firstValue))\n                .map(Map.Entry::getKey)\n                .findFirst()\n                .orElse(null);\n\nIn this code, we first create a TreeSet from the values of the map. The first() method of TreeSet returns the first (smallest) element in the set. This is the first value after sorting.\nThen we use a stream to filter the entries of the map that have this first value. The map method is used to get the key of these entries. The findFirst() method returns an Optional that contains the first element of the stream, or an empty Optional if the stream is empty. The orElse(null) method returns the value of this Optional if it is present, otherwise it returns null.\nNote: This code assumes that there is at least one entry with the first value in the map. If there are no such entries, the orElse(null) method will return null.\n\nA: Here is a more concise way to do it using Java 8 streams:\nInteger firstValue = new TreeSet<>(map.values()).first();\nString key = map.entrySet().stream()\n                .filter(e -> e.getValue().equals(firstValue))\n                .map(Map.Entry::getKey)\n                .findFirst()\n                .orElse(null);\n\nThis code does the same thing as the previous one, but it's more concise. It uses the Java 8 streams API to filter the entries of the map that have the first value and then get the key of these entries. If there are no such entries, the orElse(null) method will return null.\n\nA: Here is a more concise way to do it using Java 8 streams:\nInteger firstValue = new TreeSet<>(map.values()).first();\nString key = map.entrySet().stream()\n                .filter(e -> e.getValue().equals(firstValue))\n                .map(Map.Entry::getKey)\n                .findFirst()\n                .orElse(null);\n\nThis code does the same thing as the previous one, but it's more concise.
