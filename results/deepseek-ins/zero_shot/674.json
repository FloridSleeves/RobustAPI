The class file is a binary format that contains the bytecode instructions that the JVM can execute. The JVM does not store the source code, it only stores the bytecode instructions.\n\nThe class file format is a file format used by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to store compiled code. It is a binary format that contains the bytecode instructions that the JVM can execute. The class file format is designed to be platform-independent, meaning that the same class file can be used on different hardware and operating systems.\n\nIf you want to store the compiled code, you would typically use a file format that is more human-readable, such as a text file. For example, you could use PrintWriter.write to write the bytecode instructions to a text file. However, this is generally not recommended for production code, as it would make the code much harder to debug and maintain.\n\nIn summary, the JVM does not store compiled code in a class file.
