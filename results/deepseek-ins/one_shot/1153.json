Write your code in a text editor.\n2. Save the file with a .java extension.\n3. Compile your code using the command: javac YourFileName.java\n4. If there are no errors in your code, this will create a .class file.\n5. Run your code using the command: java YourClassName\n6. If you want to submit your code to a programming competition, you can submit it through the competition's website.\n\nPlease note that the steps may vary depending on the competition and the website you are using.\n\nAlso, remember to follow the competition's rules and regulations.\n\nThis is a basic guide and the actual process may vary.\n\nPlease let me know if you need further assistance.\n\nAnswer: Yes, you can submit your solution in Java by following these steps:\n\n1.
