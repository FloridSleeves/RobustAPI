But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Java create a class to print ArrayList to file: :Here is the code I have.This is my PrintToFile classimport java.util.*;import java.io.*;public class PrintToFile{        File f;        FileWriter fw;        PrintWriter pw;    public void PrintToFile()throws Exception{//remove void from constructor      File f = new File (\"Output.txt\");//dont reinitialize       FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(f, true);//dont reinitialize      PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(fw);//dont reinitialize    }    public void printExp(ArrayList<Expense> expList){        for(int i = 0; i < expList.size(); i++){         pw.println(\"---------------------------------------\");//exception here         pw.println(expList.get(i));      }        pw.close();    }}in my main class here is my call to print my ArrayList    PrintToFile printer = new PrintToFile();    printer.printExp(expList);   I have defined expList as an ArrayList of objects The exception I get is a Exception in thread \"main\" java.lang.NullPointerExceptionoccuring where marked.

Thanks\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.println\n<<<code>>>: try { pw.println(\"---------------------------------------\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are trying to print a string to a PrintWriter which is not initialized. You need to initialize the PrintWriter before using it. Also, you should catch the exception that may be thrown by the println method.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem.

It returns null if the stream has reached the end. In your case, you are only reading one line, so it prints \"1\" and then returns null. If you want to read all lines, you should call readLine() in a loop until it returns null.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem.

The BufferedReader.readLine() method reads until it encounters a newline character, so it reads \"123\" as one line.\nYou should use printWriter.println() instead of printWriter.write() to send each line separately:\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\nThen in your BufferedReader, you should call readLine() in a loop until it returns null:\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n\nThis will print each line separately.\n\nA: The problem is that you are not sending newline characters (\"\\n\") between your lines.
