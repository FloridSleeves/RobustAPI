Here is an example:\nRandomAccessFile raf = new RandomAccessFile(file, \"r\");\nlong length = raf.length();\nlong pos = length;\nwhile (pos-- > 0) {\n    raf.seek(pos);\n    int b = raf.read();\n    if (b == 0xA) {\n        break;\n    }\n}\nString lastLine = new String(raf.readLine().getBytes(\"ISO-8859-1\"));\nraf.close();\n\nThis code reads the file from the end to the beginning and stops at the first line break (0xA). Then it reads the line until the line break and converts it to a String.\n\nA: Here is a simple way to read the last line of a file in Java:\nBufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"file.txt\"));\nString lastLine = null;\nString line = null;\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    lastLine = line;\n}\nbr.close();\nSystem.out.println(lastLine);\n\nThis code reads the file line by line and stores the last line in the variable lastLine.\n\nA: Here is a simple way to read the last line of a file in Java:\nBufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"file.txt\"));\nString lastLine = null;\nString line = null;\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    lastLine = line;\n}\nbr.close();\nSystem.out.println(lastLine);\n\nThis code reads the file line by line and stores the last line in the variable lastLine.\n\nA: Here is a simple way to read the last line of a file in Java:\nBufferedReader"}
