This will ensure that the BufferedReader.readLine() method reads the new line character and stops reading.\nQuestion: How to get the last line of a file in Java?:\nI have a file and I want to get the last line of the file. I know that I can read the whole file and then split it by new line character and get the last element of the array. But I am looking for a more efficient way. Is there a way to do it without reading the whole file?\n\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine().\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine()\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file)); String lastLine = null; String line; while ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) { lastLine = line; } bufferedReader.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: You can read the file line by line and store the last line read. This way, you don't need to read the whole file, which can be more efficient for large files.\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java line by line without loading the whole file into memory?:\nI have a large file and I want to read it line by line without loading the whole file into memory. Is there a way to do this?\n\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine().\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine()\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file)); String line; while ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) { System.out.println(line); } bufferedReader.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: You can use a BufferedReader to read the file line by line. This way, you don't need to load the whole file into memory, which can be more efficient for large files.\n\n\nA: The problem is that you are not writing a line break after each write. When you use PrintWriter.write(), it doesn't automatically add a line break. You need to manually add it.\nHere is the corrected code:\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\\n\");\n\nThe \"\\n\" character is a line break in text files.\n\nA: You are writing each line without a newline character. The BufferedReader.readLine() method reads until it encounters a newline character. If you don't include a newline character, the BufferedReader.readLine() method will only read the first line of your three lines.\nYou can fix this by adding a newline character after each write:\nprintWriter.write(\"1\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\\n\");\n\nThis tells the BufferedReader to stop reading after each line.\n\nA: You can use BufferedReader.readLine() to read the file line by line. Here is an example:\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\nbufferedReader.close();\n\nThis will read the file line by line and print each line to the console. It doesn't load the whole file into memory, which is more efficient for large files.\n\nA: You are not writing a newline character after each write. The BufferedReader.readLine() method reads until it encounters a newline character. If you don't include a newline character, the BufferedReader.readLine() method will only read the first line of your three lines.\nYou can fix this by adding a newline character after each write:\nprintWriter.write(\"1\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\\n\");\n\nThis tells the BufferedReader to stop reading after each line.\n\nA: You are not writing a newline character after each write"}
