The compiler complains about the super token in <B super A> because you can't have lower-bounded type variables!

Try to just use the value of the foreach inside the loop.\n\nA: The issue is that you're calling dataSnapshot.getChildren().iterator().next() in your loop. This will always return the first child of the DataSnapshot because you're creating a new iterator in each loop iteration.\nInstead, you should use the iterator you've created in the outer loop and call next() on it in each loop iteration.
