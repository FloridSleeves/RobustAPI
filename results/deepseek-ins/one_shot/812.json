So, by writing \"Line3: \\n\" to the PrintWriter, you are telling it to write \"Line3:\" and then start a new line. This effectively ignores the blank line.\n\nA: The problem is that you are writing strings without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters (like '\\n', '\\r', or \"\\r\\n\") which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nYou can solve this by adding a line break after each string you write to the PrintWriter. Here is an example:\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\\n\");\n\nThis will ensure that each string is written on a new line, which should solve your problem.\n\nA: You are writing the strings without a line break. BufferedReader.readLine() reads a line from the stream, which it does by reading characters until it encounters a line separator.\nYou can solve this by adding a line break after each string you write to the PrintWriter.
