The error message you're seeing is indicating that the JSON string you're sending is not properly formatted, likely because it's too large.\n\nUnterminated array at line 1 column 106498\n\nThis suggests that the JSON string is not properly formatted, possibly due to its size.\n\nTo solve this issue, you should consider breaking down the large JSON string into smaller chunks and sending them separately. This way, you can avoid the issue of the JSON string being too large and getting cut off.\n\nHere's a simple example of how you can break down a large JSON string into smaller chunks:\n\n```java\npublic void sendLargeJson(String largeJson) {\n    int chunkSize = 1000; // Adjust this value based on your needs\n    for (int i = 0; i < largeJson.length(); i += chunkSize) {\n        String chunk = largeJson.substring(i, Math.min(i + chunkSize, largeJson.length()));\n        sendResponse(chunk);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `sendLargeJson` method breaks down the large JSON string into smaller chunks of size 1000 and sends each chunk separately. You can adjust the `chunkSize` value based on your needs.\n\nRemember to handle the chunks received on the client side in a way that concatenates them back into a single JSON string.\n\nI hope this helps you solve your issue.
