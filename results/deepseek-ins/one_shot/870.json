The second argument is an array of the columns you want to retrieve. The third argument is the selection criteria, which is a WHERE clause in the SQL statement. The fourth argument is an array of the values to replace the \"?\" in the selection criteria. The fifth, sixth and seventh arguments are for sorting, grouping and having clauses, which are not used in this case.\n\nPlease help me thanks in advance.\n\n\nA: You are using the selectionArgs correctly. The problem is with the selection string.\nYou should use \"col2 IS NOT NULL\" directly in the selection string, not \"col2 = ?\".\nHere is the corrected code:\nCursor cursor = db.query(\"MyTable\", null,\n         \"col1 = ? AND col2 IS NOT NULL\",\n         new String[] { \"something\" },\n         null, null, null);\n\nThis will return all rows where col1 equals \"something\" and col2 is not null.\n\nA: You are using the selectionArgs correctly.
