But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Results printing to console but not to the file: :I'm trying to print to a .csv like so:(A and B are ArrayLists of type String)for(int i = 0; i < A.size(); i++) {    PrintWriter output = new PrintWriter(csvFile);    System.out.println(A.get(i)+\", \"+ B.get(i));    output.println(A.get(i)+\", \"+ B.get(i));}I'm getting the desired results to the console, however when I try to overwrite the file I am reading from, it is completely blank.  Any ideas?  I do need to overwrite the file as I don't want the original data preserved.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem.

You should open it before the loop and close it after the loop. Also, you need to call flush() method to make sure all the data is written to the file.\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java:\n\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"file.txt\")); String line; while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) { System.out.println(line); }\n<<<explanation>>>: This code reads a file line by line using BufferedReader.readLine method. It continues to read until it reaches the end of the file.\nQuestion: How to write to a file in Java:\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.println.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.println\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(\"file.txt\", \"UTF-8\"); pw.println(\"Hello, World!\"); pw.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: This code writes a string to a file using PrintWriter.println method. The file is encoded in UTF-8. After writing, you should always close the PrintWriter to free up system resources.\n\n\nA: The problem is that you're writing to the PrintWriter without a newline character. The BufferedReader is waiting for a newline character to determine the end of a line. You can fix this by adding a newline character to each write:\nprintWriter.write(\"1\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\\n\");\n\nAlternatively, you can use println instead of write:\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\nBoth of these will ensure that each line is properly terminated, and the BufferedReader will read each line correctly.\n\nA: You are writing to the PrintWriter without a newline character.
