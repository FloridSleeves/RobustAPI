Please advise how can I perform this .\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: DataOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>: dos.write(buff, 10, buff.length-10);\n<<<explanation>>>: You can use the DataOutputStream.write method to write the byte array to the file. The first parameter is the byte array, the second parameter is the starting position in the array, and the third parameter is the number of bytes to write. In your case, you want to start writing from the 11th byte (0-indexed), so you should use 10 as the second parameter. The third parameter is the length of the byte array minus the number of bytes you want to skip (10), which is buff.length-10.\n\nA: The issue is likely due to the encoding of the text. The emojis are not being displayed correctly because they are not being encoded in UTF-8.\nYou can try to encode the text in UTF-8 before sending it. Here is an example of how to do it:\n```kotlin\nval emojiText = \"Your text with emojis\"\nval encodedText = emojiText.toByteArray(Charset.forName(\"UTF-8\"))\n```\nThen, you can use `DataOutputStream.write(byte[] b, int off, int len)` to write the encoded text to the DataOutputStream:\n```kotlin\ndataOutputStream.write(encodedText, 0, encodedText.size)\n```\nThis should ensure that the emojis are correctly encoded and displayed on the server side.\n\nFor the second question, you can use the `indexOf` method to find the position of the \"\u00d0\u00cf\" sequence in the byte array:\n```kotlin\nval index = buff.indexOf(byteArrayOf(0xD0.toByte(), 0xCF.toByte()))\n```\nIf the \"\u00d0\u00cf\" sequence is found, you can write the remaining bytes to the output file:\n```kotlin\nif (index != -1) {\n    dos.write(buff, index + 2, buff.size - index - 2)\n}\n```\nThis will write all bytes after the \"\u00d0\u00cf\" sequence to the output file.\n\nPlease note that the byte values for \"\u00d0\u00cf\" are 0xD0 and 0xCF respectively.\n\nAlso, remember to close the DataOutputStream and InputStream when you're done with them to free up system resources.\n\n```kotlin\ndos.close()\ndis.close()\n```\n\nI hope this helps. Let me know if you have any further questions.\n\nA: The problem is not with the emojis, but with the encoding of the text.
