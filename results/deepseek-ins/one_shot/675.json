But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: How to use PrintWriter and File classes in Java?: :I am trying to understand PrintWriter for a small program I'm making, and I cant seem to get java to make the file and then write on it. When I execute the program below it gives me a Filenotfoundexeption error on line 9. It also fails to make the file in the directory that I specified. I am new to this so please try and keep the answers simple.

This will try to create a new file with that path and it will fail if the file already exists. Instead, you should pass the File object to the PrintWriter constructor.\nQuestion: How to use PrintWriter and File classes in Java?:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(file);\n<<<explanation>>>: You need to pass the File object to the PrintWriter constructor.\nQuestion: How to use PrintWriter and File classes in Java?:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(file);\n<<<explanation>>>: You need to pass the File object to the PrintWriter constructor.\nQuestion: How to use PrintWriter and File classes in Java?:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(file);\n<<<explanation>>>: You need to pass the File object to the PrintWriter constructor.\nQuestion: How to use PrintWriter and File classes in Java?:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(file);\n<<<explanation>>>: You need to pass the File object to the PrintWriter constructor.\nQuestion: How to use PrintWriter and File classes in Java?:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(file);\n<<<explanation>>>: You need to pass the File object to the PrintWriter constructor.\nQuestion: How to use PrintWriter and File classes in Java?:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(file);\n<<<explanation>>>: You need to pass the File object to the PrintWriter constructor.\nQuestion: How to use PrintWriter and File classes in Java?:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(file);\n<<<explanation>>>: You need to pass the File object to the PrintWriter constructor.\nQuestion: How to use PrintWriter and File classes in Java?:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(file);\n<<<explanation>>>: You need to pass the File object to the PrintWriter constructor.\nQuestion: How to use PrintWriter and File classes in Java?:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(file);\n<<<explanation>>>: You need to pass the File object to the PrintWriter constructor.\nQuestion: How to use PrintWriter and File classes in Java?:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(file);\n<<<explanation>>>: You need to pass the File object to the PrintWriter constructor.\nQuestion: How to use PrintWriter and File classes in Java?:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(file);\n<<<explanation>>>: You need to pass the File object to the PrintWriter constructor.\nQuestion: How to use PrintWriter and File classes in Java?:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(file);\n<<<explanation>>>: You need to pass the File object to the PrintWriter constructor.\nQuestion: How to use PrintWriter and File classes in Java?:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(file);\n<<<explanation>>>: You need to pass the File object to the PrintWriter constructor.\nQuestion: How to use PrintWriter and File classes in Java?:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(file);\n<<<explanation>>>: You need to pass the File object to the PrintWriter constructor.\nQuestion: How to use PrintWriter and File classes in Java?:\nAnswer"}
