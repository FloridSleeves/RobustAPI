But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: JAVA Error in Input I/O homework (beginner): :I have to write a program that estimates the number of bottles of a drink someone would have to drink to win a prize, if there is a 1 in 5 chance that a bottle cap will have a prize. The user inputs the number of trials of opening bottles, and the program outputs the average number of bottles taken to win a prize, and stores how many drinks each individual trial took to win, in a separate text file. import java.io.IOException;import java.io.PrintWriter;import java.util.Scanner;import java.io.File;public class BottleCapPrize2{public static void main (String[] args) throws IOException{   Scanner in = new Scanner (System.in);   System.out.print(\"Number of Trials: \");   int trials = in.nextInt();   int trialNumber = 0;   int total = 0;   int average = 0;   for (int x = 0; x < trials; x++){      int counter = 0;      double randNum = Math.random();      trialNumber++;       while (randNum < 0.8){       counter ++;       randNum = Math.random();       }     total += counter;     average = (int) total/trials;     PrintWriter outFile = new PrintWriter (new File (\"bottleCap.txt\"));     outFile.println(\"Trial \" + trialNumber + \" took \" + counter + \" drinks.\");     outFile.close();     if (trialNumber == trials){     System.out.println(\"The average was \" + average);    }   }     }The part of the program that outputs to the compiler works fine, but the part that outputs to the text file (bottleCap.txt) does not work correctly. When I open bottleCap.txt, something along the lines of \"Trial 1 took 3 drinks.\", \"Trial 2 took 5 drinks.\", .... \"Trial 10 took 9 drinks.\" should be written.Instead, I only see the output for the last Trial of the program. (If the user entered 10 trials, then the text file only has written \"Trial 10 took 3 drinks\", and nothing for Trials 1-9). Can someone help me figure out the problem?

This was very helpful! **\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: outFile.println(\"Trial \" + trialNumber + \" took \" + counter + \" drinks.\");\n<<<explanation>>>: You are closing the PrintWriter after each write. This means that after each trial, you are closing the file, and therefore, you are not writing to the file anymore. You should close the PrintWriter after all the trials are done.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem.

It returns null if the end of the stream has been reached. In your case, you are calling readLine() three times, so it reads the first line and then the stream is closed. The next readLine() call returns null, so it prints null. If you want to print the first line, you should call readLine() only once.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem.
