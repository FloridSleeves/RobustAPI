In case we have to use 2 XMLs in an Activity, one as activity.setcontentview(layout1) and another as a PopupWindow.setContentView(layout2). What will happen in such case?\n\nAnswer: The Android system does not allow duplicate IDs in the same layout. If you define the same ID in two different layouts, the system will only recognize one of them. The IDs are used to reference specific views in the layout, and having duplicate IDs would cause confusion and unexpected behavior.\n\nQuestion: NullPointerExcetption with AppCompat and ActionBar: :The Activity I have crashes everytime with this error.

In this case, it seems like the getSupportActionBar() method is returning null, which means the ActionBar is not available in your current context.\n\nQuestion: I have a custom view that extends RelativeLayout. Inside this custom view, I have a button. I want to set an OnClickListener for this button. How can I do this?\n\nAnswer: You can set an OnClickListener for a button inside your custom view by following these steps:\n\n1. First, you need to define the button in your custom view's XML layout file.\n2. Then, in your custom view class, override the onFinishInflate() method. This method is called when the view hierarchy is fully inflated.\n3. Inside onFinishInflate(), find the button using findViewById() and set the OnClickListener.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```java\npublic class CustomView extends"}
