Please see my answer\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"[INFO] - My custom log message\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: You can use PrintWriter.write to write custom logging messages to a .log file. You can specify the level of your log message by adding a prefix to your log message. For example, \"[INFO] - My custom log message\". This way, you can easily identify the level of your log message and filter out the ones you don't need.\n\n\nA: The problem is that you're writing to the PrintWriter without a newline character. The BufferedReader is reading until it sees a newline character, which it doesn't see because you're writing without one.\nYou can fix this by adding a newline character after each write:\nprintWriter.write(\"1\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\\n\");\n\nAlternatively, you can use println instead of write:\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\nBoth of these will ensure that each write is followed by a newline character, which the BufferedReader will recognize as the end of a line.\n\nA: You are writing to the PrintWriter without a newline character.
