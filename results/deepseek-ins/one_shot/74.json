The emojis are not being displayed correctly because they are not being encoded correctly.\n\nIn your VolleyFileUploadRequest, you are setting the content type as \"text/plain; charset=UTF-8\". This tells the server that the text is in UTF-8 encoding. But the server might not be correctly interpreting the UTF-8 encoding.\n\nTo solve this, you need to ensure that the server is correctly interpreting the UTF-8 encoding. You can do this by setting the content type as \"text/plain; charset=UTF-8\" in the request headers.\n\nHere is how you can do it:\n\n```java\nrequest.setHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"text/plain; charset=UTF-8\");\n```\n\nThis will tell the server that the text is in UTF-8 encoding. The server should then be able to correctly interpret the emojis.\n\nAlso, ensure that the server is configured to handle UTF-8 encoding. If the server is not configured to handle UTF-8 encoding, you may need to change the server's configuration to handle UTF-8 encoding.\n\nI hope this helps.
