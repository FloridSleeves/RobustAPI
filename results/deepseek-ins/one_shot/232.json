It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time.

This is a common pattern for reading from an InputStream and writing to an OutputStream. The read method returns the number of bytes read, which you can use to know how much of the buffer you actually wrote. This way you can ensure that you are writing all the bytes that were read.\nQuestion: Android InputStream.read() horribly slow:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\nint bytesRead;\nwhile ((bytesRead = is.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n    // process buffer\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You are reading from the InputStream into a buffer and then processing that buffer. This is a common pattern for reading from an InputStream. The read method returns the number of bytes read, which you can use to know how much of the buffer you actually processed. This way you can ensure that you are processing all the bytes that were read.\n\nA: The problem might be with the way you're reading from the InputStream. You're reading one byte at a time, which is inefficient. You should read into a larger buffer and then process that buffer. Here's an example of how you could do that:\n\n```java\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\nint bytesRead;\nwhile ((bytesRead = is.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n    // process buffer\n}\n```\n\nThis code reads up to 1024 bytes into the buffer at a time, and then processes that buffer. The `read` method returns the number of bytes read, which you can use to know how much of the buffer you actually processed. This way you can ensure that you are processing all the bytes that were read.\n\nAlso, make sure that you're not calling `is.read()` in a tight loop. This can cause your app to become unresponsive. Instead, read into a buffer and process that buffer.\n\nLastly, make sure that you're not calling `is.read()` in a tight loop. This can cause your app to become unresponsive.

If you're using an older version of Java, you might need to use a different method to read from the InputStream.\n\nAlso, make sure that you're not calling `is.read()` in a tight loop.
