It returns null if the stream ends. In your case, you are reading the first line of the stream which is \"123\". If you want to read the first line only, you should call readLine() only once.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem.

It automatically appends a newline character to the end of the string. This is why you are seeing \"123\" when you read the line with BufferedReader.\n\n\nA: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\n\nYou should use printWriter.println(\"1\"); instead of printWriter.write(\"1\");. printWriter.println(\"1\"); will write \"1\" followed by a line separator (which is a newline character '\\n') to the stream.\n\nHere is the corrected code:\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\nAnd then you can read the lines with BufferedReader:\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine()); // This will print \"1\"\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine()); // This will print \"2\"\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine()); // This will print \"3\"\n\nThis way, each printWriter.println(\"...\"); will write a new line to the stream, and each bufferedReader.readLine(); will read a line from"}
