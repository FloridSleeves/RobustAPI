In Android, findViewById() is used to get a reference to the Views defined in your layout file. It is called after the setContentView() method because the layout file is not yet fully inflated and parsed when findViewById() is called.\n\nhow does environment decide to which component it needs to invoke?\n\nThe environment decides which component to invoke based on the id you provide. The id is a unique identifier for a View in the layout file. When you call findViewById(), you're asking the system to return the View that has the id you provided.\n\nWhat will happen in such case?\n\nIf you have two layouts with the same ids, say \"image1\" in two XMLs, say \"layout1\" & \"layout2\". When you call setContentView(layout1) and then setContentView(layout2), the system will replace the previous layout with the new one. So, the Views with the same ids in the new layout will be the ones that are returned by findViewById().\n\nI would like to set my variables at the top of my class instead of in the method\n\nYou can set your variables at the top of your class. However, you need to initialize them in the onCreate() method or another method where you can call findViewById() after the layout is set. Here's an example:\n\n```java\npublic class MyClass extends Activity implements View.OnClickListener {\n    CheckBox cb1;\n    CheckBox cb2;\n\n    @Override\n    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n        cb1 = (CheckBox) findViewById(R.id.cb1);\n        cb2 = (CheckBox) findViewById(R.id.cb2);\n    }\n\n    public void checkboth(View view) {\n        cb1.setChecked(true);\n        cb2.setChecked(true);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onClick(View v) {\n        // TODO Auto-generated method stub\n\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, cb1 and cb2 are initialized in the onCreate() method and can be used in other methods of the class.\n\nA: \nwhy doesn't it give error just like we get in java code?\n\nBecause in Java, you have to call findViewById() after setting the content view.
