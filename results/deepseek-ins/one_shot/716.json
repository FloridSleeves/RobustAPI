But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Appending .txt file is erasing everything: :import java.io.FileWriter;import java.io.PrintWriter;public class DemoPrint {    public static void main (String args []) {        try{            PrintWriter coolFile = new PrintWriter(\"c:\\\\JavaIO\\\\cool.txt\");            FileWriter file = new FileWriter(\"c:\\\\JavaIO\\\\cool.txt\", true);            coolFile.println(\"Why isn't this adding another line?\");            coolFile.close();        }        catch (Exception e) {            System.out.println(\"Error\");        }}    }So I'm new to programming/java and I'm trying to open this file and append the data and add another line but for some reason the data is just being erased and overwritten with whatever I have in the coolFile.println(\"\").Can anyone help me out on this? I know its probably a easy fix... I'm learning..

Thank you!\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"Why isn't this adding another line?\" + System.lineSeparator()); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: You need to add a line separator (System.lineSeparator()) to indicate the end of a line. This tells the BufferedReader to start a new line.\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nBufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"path_to_your_file\"));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\nreader.close();\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: BufferedReader is a class in java.io package that is used to read the data from a character-input stream. It's more efficient than using the FileReader class alone because it reads data into a buffer.\nQuestion: How to write a file in Java:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nPrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"path_to_your_file\", \"UTF-8\");\nwriter.println(\"Hello, World!\");\nwriter.close();\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: PrintWriter is a class in java.io package that is used to write formatted representations of objects to a text-output stream. It's more efficient than using the FileWriter class alone because it writes data into a buffer. The second argument to the PrintWriter constructor is the character encoding to use, in this case \"UTF-8\".\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.println.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.println\n<<<code>>>: printWriter.println(\"Hello, World!\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The println method of PrintWriter class is used to write a line of text followed by a line separator. The line separator string is defined by the system property line.separator, and is not necessarily a single newline ('\\n') character.\n\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: String line = bufferedReader.readLine();\n<<<explanation>>>: The readLine method of BufferedReader class is used to read a line of text. It returns null if the end of the stream has been reached.\n\nPlease using this api: FileWriter.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileWriter\n<<<code>>>: FileWriter fileWriter = new FileWriter(\"file.txt\");\n<<<explanation>>>: FileWriter is a class in java.io package that is used to write character-output to a file. It's a subclass of the OutputStreamWriter class.\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.close.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.close\n<<<code>>>: printWriter.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The close method of PrintWriter class is used to close the stream, flushing it first. Once the stream is closed, further write() or print() calls are not allowed.\n\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.close.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.close\n<<<code>>>: bufferedReader.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The close method of BufferedReader class is used to close the stream and release any system resources associated with it. Once the stream is closed, further read() or readLine() calls are not allowed.\n\nPlease using this api: FileReader.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileReader\n<<<code>>>: FileReader fileReader = new FileReader(\"file.txt\");\n<<<explanation>>>: FileReader is a class in java.io package that is used to read character-input from a file. It's a subclass of the InputStreamReader class.\n\nPlease using this api: FileWriter.close.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileWriter.close\n<<<code>>>: fileWriter.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The close method of FileWriter class is used to close the stream, flushing it first. Once the stream is closed, further write() calls are not allowed.\n\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine"}
