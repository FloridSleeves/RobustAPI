But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: How to use an UncaughtExceptionHandler in Servlets: :I implemented an UncaughtExceptionHandler on StartUp of tomcat: Thread.setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler(new UncaughtExceptionHandler() {        @Override        public void uncaughtException(Thread t, Throwable e) {            LOGGER.error(\"Uncaught Exception\");            }    });When I produce an Exception in a Servlet it is not caught by my Handler:    protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) {    int i = 1/0;The console says:Feb 13, 2014 8:23:58 AM org.apache.catalina.core.StandardWrapperValve invokeSchwerwiegend: Servlet.service() for servlet [ConnectGatewaysServlet] in context with path [/infraview] threw exceptionjava.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero    at net.test.gateway.ConnectGatewaysServlet.doPost(ConnectGatewaysServlet.java:73)    at javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:647)    at javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:728)How do I implement an UncaughtExceptionHandler for Servlets?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem.

This way, every new thread created after this listener is initialized will have this handler.\nQuestion: How to use a custom ThreadFactory in Java:\n\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: ThreadFactory\n<<<code>>>: ThreadFactory threadFactory = r -> {\n    Thread thread = new Thread(r);\n    thread.setUncaughtExceptionHandler((t, e) -> LOGGER.error(\"Uncaught Exception\", e));\n    return thread;\n};\nExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10, threadFactory);\n<<<explanation>>>: You can create a custom ThreadFactory that sets an uncaught exception handler for every new thread. This can be done by implementing the ThreadFactory interface and returning a new Thread for every new Runnable. The Thread can be configured with an uncaught exception handler.\n\n\nA: You are writing the strings \"1\", \"2\" and \"3\" without a line break. The BufferedReader.readLine() method reads a line from the stream, which it does by reading characters until it encounters a line terminator. In your case, the line terminator is the end of the stream, so it reads all the characters and returns them as a single string.\nTo fix this, you should write a line break character after each string. Here is how you can do it:\nprintWriter.write(\"1\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\\n\");\n\nThis will make sure that each string is followed by a line break, and each readLine() call will return a single line.\n\nA: The BufferedReader.readLine() method reads a line from the stream. It stops reading when it encounters a line terminator, which is a newline ('\\n') or a carriage return ('\\r') or a carriage return followed immediately by a newline.\nIn your case, you are writing \"1\", \"2\" and \"3\" without any line terminator. So, when you call readLine(), it reads all these characters as a single line.\nTo solve this problem, you should write a line terminator after each string. You can use '\\n' for Unix-based systems and '\\r\\n' for Windows-based systems.\nprintWriter.write(\"1\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\\n\");\n\nThis way, each write will be followed by a line terminator, and each readLine() call will return a single line.\n\nA: You are writing the strings \"1\", \"2\" and \"3\" without a line break.
