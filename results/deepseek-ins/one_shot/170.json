It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Executing command in terminal from java programmatically: :I have a requirement to execute a command in terminal using java.

Instead, you should read the file in chunks"}
