It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block.

You then read the actual text data into a byte array and convert it to a String using UTF_16LE encoding.\n\nA: You are reading one byte at a time, which is very inefficient. Instead, you should read a larger chunk of data at once and then process it.\nHere's an example of how you can do this:\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576]; // 1MB buffer\nint bytesRead;\nwhile ((bytesRead = is.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n    // Process the data in the buffer\n    // You can use Arrays.copyOfRange to get a subarray if needed\n}\n\nThis will read a large chunk of data into the buffer, and then you can process it all at once. If the server sends less than the buffer size, it will return the actual number of bytes read. If the server sends more, it will keep reading until it reaches the end of the stream.\nAlso, make sure to handle the case where the server sends less than the buffer size, and the case where the server sends more than the buffer size.\n\nA: You can use the read(byte[] b) method of InputStream which reads some number of bytes from the input stream and stores them into the buffer array b.\nHere is an example:\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\nint bytesRead;\nwhile ((bytesRead = is.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n    // Process the data in the buffer\n}\n\nIn this code, the read(buffer) method will try to read up to buffer.length bytes from the input stream. The method returns the total number of bytes read into the buffer, or -1 if there is no more data because the end of the stream has been reached.\nThis way you read data in chunks, which is more efficient than reading one byte at a time.\n\nA: You can use a BufferedInputStream to improve the performance. It buffers the data from the underlying input stream, so that it can read the data more quickly.\nBufferedInputStream bis = new BufferedInputStream(client.getInputStream());\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint bytesRead;\nwhile ((bytesRead = bis.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n    // Process the data in the buffer\n}\n\nThe BufferedInputStream will read data into its internal buffer, and then you can process it from there. This can significantly improve the performance of your read operations.\n\nA: You can use a BufferedInputStream to improve the performance.
