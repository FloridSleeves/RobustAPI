It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Run a command over SSH with JSch: :I'm trying to run a command over SSH with JSch, but JSch has virtually no documentation and the examples I've found are terrible.

It uses a while loop to keep reading from the input stream until the channel is closed.\nQuestion: How to get the current location of the device in Android: :I'm trying to get the current location of the device in Android. I've tried using the LocationManager but it's not giving me the correct location. I've also tried using the GPS and Network providers but they don't seem to be working.\nPlease using this api: LocationManager.getLastKnownLocation.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: LocationManager.getLastKnownLocation\n<<<code>>>: LocationManager locationManager = (LocationManager) getSystemService(Context.LOCATION_SERVICE);\nLocation location = locationManager.getLastKnownLocation(LocationManager.GPS_PROVIDER);\nif (location == null) {\n    location = locationManager.getLastKnownLocation(LocationManager.NETWORK_PROVIDER);\n}\nif (location != null) {\n    double currentLatitude = location.getLatitude();\n    double currentLongitude = location.getLongitude();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: This code gets the last known location from the GPS and Network providers. If the GPS provider has a location, it will be used. If not, it will try with the Network provider. The latitude and longitude can then be retrieved from the location object.\nQuestion: How to get the current date and time in Android: :I'm trying to get the current date and time in Android. I've tried using the Calendar class but it's not giving me the correct date and time. I've also tried using the Date class but it's not working either.\nPlease using this api: Calendar.getInstance.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Calendar.getInstance\n<<<code>>>: Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();\nint year = calendar.get(Calendar.YEAR);\nint month = calendar.get(Calendar.MONTH); // Note: This will give you month number, not the name\nint day = calendar.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH);\nint hour = calendar.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY);\nint minute = calendar.get(Calendar.MINUTE);\nint second = calendar.get(Calendar.SECOND);\n<<<explanation>>>: This code gets the current date and time from the Calendar instance. The year, month, day, hour, minute, and second can then be retrieved from the Calendar object. Note that the month is 0-based, so January is 0, February is 1, etc.\n\n\nA: The problem with your code is that you are reading one byte at a time, which is very inefficient. Instead, you should read the entire buffer at once. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```java\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576"}
