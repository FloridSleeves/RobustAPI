But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Extract text from html file using java: :I am working on a text crawler and I need to extract a certain text from several sites.

In this case, you are selecting all 'p' elements where the 'dir' attribute is 'rtl'.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines:\n\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: String line; while ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) { System.out.println(line); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The BufferedReader.readLine method reads a line of text. It returns null if the end of the stream has been reached. You can use a while loop to read all lines until the end of the stream.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines:\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: printWriter.write(\"1\\n\"); printWriter.write(\"2\\n\"); printWriter.write(\"3\\n\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The PrintWriter.write method writes a string. You can use it to send multiple lines. To separate the lines, you can use a newline character ('\\n').\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines:\n\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: String line; while ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) { System.out.println(line); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The BufferedReader.readLine method reads a line of text.
