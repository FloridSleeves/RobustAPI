You cannot have same id for the view's in the same view tree. (must be unique).\n\nA: \nwhy doesn't it give error just like we get in java code?\n\nThe Android system does not enforce unique IDs in the same view tree. It's designed this way to allow multiple views with the same ID in different view trees. This is because the ID is used to find a view in the view hierarchy, and it's possible for a view to be part of multiple view trees.\n\nhow does environment decide to which component it needs to invoke?\n\nThe environment doesn't decide which component to invoke. It's the developer who uses the findViewById() method to get a reference to a view in the current view hierarchy.\n\nWhat will happen in such case?\n\nIf you have two XML layouts with the same ID in different activities, the findViewById() method will return the view from the last setContentView() call. This is because the view hierarchy is reset every time setContentView() is called, so the views from the previous layout are not available.\n\nhow do I get the Dialog to correctly resize itself to display all of the content in the custom View?\n\nYou can set the width and height of the dialog using the setLayout() method of the dialog's window. Here's an example:\n\n```java\n@Override\npublic Dialog onCreateDialog(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n    // Create the dialog\n    AlertDialog.Builder db = new AlertDialog.Builder(getActivity());\n    db.setTitle(\"Test Alert Dialog:\");\n    db.setView(new myView(getActivity()));\n    AlertDialog dialog = db.create();\n\n    // Set the layout of the dialog\n    dialog.getWindow().setLayout(ViewGroup.LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT, ViewGroup.LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT);\n\n    return dialog;\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the width and height of the dialog are set to wrap the content of the custom view. The width is set to WRAP_CONTENT, which means the dialog will be wide enough to fit the content of the custom view. The height is also set to WRAP_CONTENT, which means the dialog will be tall enough to fit the content of the custom view.\n\nPlease note that the setLayout() method should be called before the dialog is displayed. If you call it after the dialog is displayed, it won't have any effect.\n\nI hope this helps.
