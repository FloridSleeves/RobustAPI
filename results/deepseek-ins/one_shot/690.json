But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: ObjectOutputStream: appending question marks at the beginning of the String: :Server(Java) sends a Json String to a client(TypeScript). On the client I get the following:  Therefore JSON.parse() fails due to question marks being appended.

If the client is using a BufferedReader, it will not be able to correctly parse the JSON because it expects a line-based protocol.\n\nA: The problem is that you're writing each line as a separate write operation, but the BufferedReader.readLine() method reads until it encounters a line terminator, which is not what you're providing.\nYou should write each line with a line terminator (like \"\\n\" or \"\\r\\n\"), and then read each line separately.\nHere is an example:\nServer:\nPrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true);\nprintWriter.write(\"1\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\\n\");\nprintWriter.close();\n\nClient:\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine()); // prints \"1\"\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine()); // prints \"2\"\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine()); // prints \"3\"\nbufferedReader.close();\n\nThis way, each line is sent and received separately.\n\nA: The problem is that you're writing each line as a separate write operation, but the BufferedReader.readLine() method reads until it encounters a line terminator, which is not what you're providing.\nYou should write each line with a line terminator (like \"\\n\" or \"\\r\\n\"), and then read each line separately.\nHere is an example:\nServer:\nPrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true);\nprintWriter.write(\"1\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\\n\");\nprintWriter.close();\n\nClient:\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine()); // prints \"1\"\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine()); // prints \"2\"\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine()); // prints \"3\"\nbufferedReader.close();\n\nThis way, each line is sent and received separately.\n\nA: You are writing each line as a separate write operation, but the BufferedReader.readLine() method reads until it encounters a line terminator, which is not what you're providing.\nYou should write each line with a line terminator (like \"\\n\" or \"\\r\\n\"), and then read each line separately.\nHere is an example:\nServer:\nPrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true);\nprintWriter.write(\"1\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\\n\");\nprintWriter.close();\n\nClient:\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine()); // prints \"1\"\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine()); // prints \"2\"\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine()); // prints \"3\"\nbufferedReader.close();\n\nThis way, each line is sent and received separately.\n\nA: You are writing each line as a separate write operation, but the BufferedReader.readLine() method reads until it encounters a line terminator, which is not what you're providing.\nYou should write each line with a line terminator (like \"\\n\" or \"\\r\\n\"), and then read each line separately.\nHere is an example:\nServer:\nPrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true);\nprintWriter.write(\"1\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\\n\");\nprintWriter.close();\n\nClient:\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine()); // prints \"1\"\nSystem.out.println("}
