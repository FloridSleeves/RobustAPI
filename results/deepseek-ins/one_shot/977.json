Here is an example:\n\n```java\nString str = \"Hello, World!\";\nbyte[] bytes = str.getBytes();\n```\n\nIn this example, the string \"Hello, World!\" is converted into a byte array. The getBytes() method uses the platform's default charset to convert the String into a sequence of bytes.\n\nIf you"}
