Unfortunately, cryptography is not my strong side. Now I can write to file several messages and then close file. Then i can open it, append some messages, close again and after decryption I see padding bytes in the middle of file. Is there any way to work with encrypted file without having to decrypt it every time I want to append some messages?EDIT: little more details. Current implementation utlizes CipherOutputStream.

As i understand there's no way to seek using it.Can i use 'NoPadding' option if i will control that output data size is divisible by block size?\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.write.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: CipherOutputStream\n<<<code>>>: \n```\nFileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(\"encrypted.dat\", true);\nCipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES\");\ncipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);\nCipherOutputStream cos = new CipherOutputStream(fos, cipher);\ncos.write(someData);\ncos.close();\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: You can use CipherOutputStream to append to an AES encrypted file. It will automatically encrypt the data you write to it. However, you cannot seek within the encrypted file. If you need to append to the file, you have to open the file in append mode and write to it. Be aware that the CipherOutputStream will encrypt the data as it is written, so you cannot write unencrypted data to the file after the CipherOutputStream. If you need to write unencrypted data to the file, you will have to use a separate OutputStream to do so.\n\nPlease note that the 'NoPadding' option is not applicable in this case. AES requires padding to work correctly, as it is a block cipher and requires the input data to be in blocks of a specific size. If you control the size of the output data, you could theoretically use 'NoPadding' if the size is a multiple of the block size, but this would be a risky assumption.\n\nAlso, remember that the CipherOutputStream does not close the underlying OutputStream. You should close the CipherOutputStream to ensure that all data is flushed and encrypted.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is possible to append to an AES encrypted file using CipherOutputStream, you will need to manage the encryption and decryption of the file yourself.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n\nPlease answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\n\nQuestion: Why is RandomAccessFile writeLong implemented with multiple write calls?: While profiling an application I noticed that RandomAccessFile.writeLong was taking a lot of time.\n\nI checked the code for this method, and it involves eight calls of the native method write.

By using a byte array to construct the long value in a byte-wise manner, we can bypass this issue and write the long value more efficiently.\n<|EOT|>\n\nPlease answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>:"}
