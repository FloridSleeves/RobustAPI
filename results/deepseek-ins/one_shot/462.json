It supports the following formats: Excel, PowerPoint, and Word. You can download it from here: https://poi.apache.org/. This code reads an Excel file and prints the values of each cell. You can replace the print statement with your own code to insert the values into your database.\n\n\nA: The problem is that you're calling dataSnapshot.getChildren().iterator().next() in each iteration of your loop. This will always give you the first child of the DataSnapshot, because you're creating a new iterator in each loop iteration.\nInstead, you should use the iterator you've created in the outer loop and call next() on it in each iteration of the inner loop.\nHere's how you can do it:\nIterator<DataSnapshot> it = dataSnapshot.getChildren().iterator();\nwhile(it.hasNext()) {\n    DataSnapshot ds = it.next();\n    names.add(ds.getValue(String.class));\n}\n\nThis way, you're using the same iterator throughout the loop, and you're getting the next child in each iteration.\n\nA: You are using the same iterator in each loop iteration. You should create a new iterator for each loop.\nHere is the corrected code:\nfor (DataSnapshot dataSnapshot1:dataSnapshot.getChildren()) {\n    i = i + 1;\n    Iterator<DataSnapshot> it = dataSnapshot1.getChildren().iterator();\n    while(it.hasNext()) {\n        names.add(it.next().getValue(String.class));\n    }\n}\n\nThis way, you create a new iterator for each DataSnapshot in the outer loop, and use it in the inner loop to get the values.\n\nA: You are using the same iterator in each loop iteration. You should create a new iterator for each loop. Here is the corrected code:\nfor (DataSnapshot dataSnapshot1:dataSnapshot.getChildren()) {\n    i = i + 1;\n    Iterator<DataSnapshot> it = dataSnapshot1.getChildren().iterator();\n    while(it.hasNext()) {\n        names.add(it.next().getValue(String.class));\n    }\n}\n\nThis way, you create a new iterator for each DataSnapshot in the outer loop, and use it in the inner loop to get the values.\n\nA: You are using the same iterator in each loop iteration. You should create a new iterator for each loop. Here is the corrected code:\nfor (DataSnapshot dataSnapshot1:dataSnapshot.getChildren()) {\n    i = i + 1;\n    Iterator<Data"}
