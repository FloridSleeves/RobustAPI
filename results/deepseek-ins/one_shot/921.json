The encoding used is the platform's default charset.\n\nIf you want to specify a charset, you can do so like this:\n\n```java\nbyte[] bytes = str.getBytes(Charset.forName(\"UTF-8\"));\n```\n\nThis will use the UTF-8 charset to encode the string.\n\nPlease note that the `getBytes()` method is available from Java 1.6 onwards. If you're using an older version of Java, you'll need to use a third-party library such as Apache Commons Lang's `StringUtils.getBytes()` method.\n\nAs for your question about OAuth HMAC-SHA1 signature, it seems you've already got the gist of it. You need to create a base string and use your OAuth Consumer Secret as the key to create a HMAC-SHA1 signature. The HMAC-SHA1 signature is then used as part of the OAuth request.\n\nAs for the expiration date, OAuth signatures do not have an expiration date. However, you can invalidate them by revoking the corresponding OAuth tokens.\n\nI hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\n\nA: Here is how you can convert a Java String to a byte array:\n\n```java\nString str = \"Hello, World!\";\nbyte[] bytes = str.getBytes();\n```\n\nIn this code, `str.getBytes()` returns a byte array that represents the string `str`.
