You should use print instead of println to avoid adding the newline character.\nQuestion: How to get the current date and time in Java?\n\nPlease using this api: java.util.Calendar.getInstance()\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: java.util.Calendar.getInstance()\n<<<code>>>: Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();\nDate currentDate = calendar.getTime();\nSimpleDateFormat formatter = new SimpleDateFormat(\"dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm:ss\");\nString currentDateAndTime = formatter.format(currentDate);\nSystem.out.println(currentDateAndTime);\n<<<explanation>>>: The java.util.Calendar.getInstance() method returns a Calendar instance representing the current date and time. You can then use the getTime() method to get the Date object. Finally, you can format this Date object to a string using SimpleDateFormat.\n\nA: You are writing each line without a newline character.
