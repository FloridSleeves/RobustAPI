It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time.

Then you can replace all & characters with &amp;. After that, you can convert the formatted String back to an InputStream. This way, you avoid the overhead of creating a new InputStream for each chunk of data.\nQuestion: How to read large files in chunks in Android: :I'm trying to read a large file (~1GB) in chunks in Android. I'm using the following code:\nInputStream is = new FileInputStream(file);\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\nint bytesRead;\nwhile ((bytesRead = is.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n    // process buffer\n}\nis.close();\n\nThe problem is that this code is very slow. It takes a long time to read the file, especially on devices with low memory. I've tried increasing the buffer size, but it doesn't make a noticeable difference. Is there a way to improve the performance of this code?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: byte[] buffer = new byte[8192];\nint bytesRead;\nwhile ((bytesRead = is.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n    // process buffer\n}\nis.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: Increasing the buffer size to 8192 bytes (8KB) can help improve performance. This is because the read() method reads up to 8KB of data at a time, which can be more efficient than reading 1KB at a time. However, please note that the actual performance improvement may vary depending on the specific characteristics of your device and the file you are reading.\nQuestion: How to read large files in chunks in Android: :I'm trying to read a large file (~1GB) in chunks in Android.
