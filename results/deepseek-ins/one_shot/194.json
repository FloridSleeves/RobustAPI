It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: execute a program with options, like ls -l: :In Java, how do I execute a linux program with options, like this:ls -a (the option is -a), and another: ./myscript name=john age=24I know how to execute a command, but cannot do the option. \nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Android InputStream.read() horribly slow:I'm working on an Android app that needs to communicate with a server (running on my PC) which is also written by me.

The first argument is the program to execute, and the second argument is an array of options. In your case, you would pass in an array with two elements: the name of the shell (\"/bin/sh\") and the command to execute (\"ls -l\").\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileInputStream\n<<<code>>>: File file = new File(\"path/to/file\");\ntry (FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(file)) {\n    byte[] data = new byte[(int) file.length()];\n    fis.read(data);\n    String text = new String(data, \"UTF-8\");\n    System.out.println(text);\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You can use the FileInputStream class to read a file in Java. The file is specified by a File object. The read method is used to read the contents of the file into a byte array. The contents of the byte array are then converted to a String using the UTF-8 encoding.\nQuestion: How to write to a file in Java:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileOutputStream\n<<<code>>>: File file = new File(\"path/to/file\");\ntry (FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(file)) {\n    String text = \"Hello, World!\";\n    byte[] data = text.getBytes(\"UTF-8\");\n    fos.write(data);\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You can use the FileOutputStream class to write to a file in Java. The file is specified by a File object. The write method is used to write the contents of a byte array to the file. In this case, the text \"Hello, World!\" is converted to a byte array using the UTF-8 encoding before being written to the file.\nQuestion: How to read a file line by line in Java:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine()\n<<<code>>>: File file = new File(\"path/to/file\");\ntry (FileReader reader = new FileReader(file)) {\n    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(reader);\n    String line;\n    while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n        System.out.println(line);\n    }\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You can use the BufferedReader.readLine() method to read a file line by line in Java. The file is specified by a File object. The readLine method is used to read the next line of the file. This method returns null when there are no more lines to read.\nQuestion: How to write to a file line by line in Java:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.println()\n<<<code>>>: File file = new File(\"path/to/file\");\ntry (PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(file)) {\n    pw.println(\"Hello, World!\");\n    pw.println(\"Another line\");\n} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You can use the PrintWriter.println() method to write to a file line by line in Java. The file is specified by a File object. The println method is used to write a line to the file. This method automatically adds a newline character at the end of the line.\nQuestion: How to read a file as a CSV in Java:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine()\n<<<code>>>: File file = new File(\"path/to/file.csv"}
