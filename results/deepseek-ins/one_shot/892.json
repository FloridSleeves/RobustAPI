This is why you are getting the same key repeated in your output.\nYou can solve this by storing the key in a variable before removing it from the map, like this:\nInteger k = sortedMap.firstKey();\noutString += String.valueOf(k);\nsortedMap.remove(k);\n\nThis way, you are always removing the first key from the map and getting its value, without having to call firstKey() again in the next iteration.\nAlso, you should check if the map is empty before calling firstKey() and remove() to avoid a NoSuchElementException.\nHere is your corrected code:\nTreeMap<Integer, Integer> sortedMap = sortMap(m);\nString outString = \"\";\nint count = 10;\nwhile (count > 0 && !sortedMap.isEmpty()) {\n    count--;\n    Integer k = sortedMap.firstKey();\n    outString += String.valueOf(k);\n    sortedMap.remove(k);\n    if (count != 0) {\n        outString += \",\";\n    }\n}\n\nSystem.out.println(\"outVal is \" + outString);\n\nThis should give you the top 10 elements of the map in the order they appear in the map.\n\nA: The problem is that you are removing the first key from the map in each iteration of the loop, but not updating the key in the next iteration.
