Try to just use the value of the foreach inside the loop.\n\nA: The problem is that you're calling dataSnapshot.getChildren().iterator().next() in your loop. This will always return the first child of the DataSnapshot because you're creating a new iterator in each loop iteration.\nInstead, you should use the iterator of the loop variable itself. Here's how you can do it:\nfor (DataSnapshot dataSnapshot1:dataSnapshot.getChildren()) {\n    i = i + 1;\n    names.add(dataSnapshot1.getValue(String.class));\n}\n\nThis way, you're using the iterator of the current DataSnapshot in each loop iteration, so you're getting the value of the current child.\n\nA: The problem is that you are using the same iterator for all children. You should use the iterator of the current child in each loop iteration. Here is the corrected code:\nfor (DataSnapshot dataSnapshot1:dataSnapshot.getChildren()) {\n    i = i + 1;\n    names.add(dataSnapshot1.getValue(String.class));\n}\n\nThis way, you are using the iterator of the current child in each loop iteration, so you are getting the value of the current child.\n\nA: The problem is that you're creating a new iterator in each loop iteration.
