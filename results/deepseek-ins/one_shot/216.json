It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: How to change servlet request body in java filter?: :How can I change request body in java filter to protect from XSS attack?I build HttpServletRequestWrapper and use getparameter for change body butget stream close exception.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Android InputStream.read() horribly slow:I'm working on an Android app that needs to communicate with a server (running on my PC) which is also written by me.

Then it overrides the getInputStream method to return a ServletInputStream that reads from this byte array. This way, the request body can be read multiple times and the original request body can be protected from XSS attacks.\n```\nQuestion: How to get the current time in milliseconds in Android?:\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: System.currentTimeMillis()\n<<<code>>>: long currentTimeMillis = System.currentTimeMillis();\n<<<explanation>>>: The System.currentTimeMillis() function in Java returns the current time in milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00.000 GMT.
