You need to manually add it.\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java using BufferedReader?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: try { BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"D:/log.txt\")); String line; while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) { System.out.println(line); } } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The BufferedReader.readLine method reads a line of text. It returns null if the end of the stream has been reached.\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java using Scanner?\nPlease using this api: Scanner.nextLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Scanner.nextLine\n<<<code>>>: try { Scanner scanner = new Scanner(new File(\"D:/log.txt\")); while (scanner.hasNextLine()) { System.out.println(scanner.nextLine()); } } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The Scanner.nextLine method reads a line of text. It returns null if the end of the stream has been reached.\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java using FileInputStream?\nPlease using this api: FileInputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileInputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: try { FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(\"D:/log.txt\"); byte[] data = new byte[1024]; int byteRead; while ((byteRead = fis.read(data)) != -1) { System.out.write(data, 0, byteRead); } } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The FileInputStream.read method reads the next byte of data from the input stream. It returns -1 if the end of the stream has been reached.\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java using FileReader?\nPlease using this api: FileReader.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileReader.read\n<<<code>>>: try { FileReader reader = new FileReader(\"D:/log.txt\"); int character; while ((character = reader.read()) != -1) { System.out.print((char) character); } } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The FileReader.read method reads a single character. It returns -1 if the end of the stream has been reached.\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java using BufferedInputStream?\nPlease using this api: BufferedInputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedInputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: try { BufferedInputStream bis = new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(\"D:/log.txt\")); byte[] data = new byte[1024]; int byteRead; while ((byteRead = bis.read(data)) != -1) { System.out.write(data, 0, byteRead); } } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The BufferedInputStream.read method reads the next byte of data from the input stream. It returns -1 if the end of the stream has been reached.\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java using BufferedReader?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: try { BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"D:/log.txt\")); String line; while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) { System.out.println(line); } } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The BufferedReader.readLine method reads a line of text.
