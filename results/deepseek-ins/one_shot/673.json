But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Unexpected character when downloading file client side from a servlet: :I create a servlet to download a specific text which the client post with a form before (in a textarea)...

So you should use a loop to read all lines until the stream ends.\n\nA: The problem is that you are not sending newline characters (\"\\n\") between your lines. The BufferedReader.readLine() method reads until it encounters a newline character, so it's reading all the data as a single line.\nYou should use PrintWriter.println() instead of PrintWriter.write() to send each line separately:\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\nThen, in your server side, you should use BufferedReader."}
