I am trying to create a separate class without a new user interface. Supposed I have a main activity wherein if I click a button it will initiate a class and call the method in it and display the text on the main activity.Now I have create created a Main activity and a class which named as BluetoothOn: Please take a look at my code:This is the main activity where the enablemyBluetooth method is the button clickpublic class MainActivity{........public void enablemyBluetooth(View view){                 BluetoothOn ble = new BluetoothOn();    ble.initializeBlue();}}Now I create a class wherein I planned to do all the processes here without intervening on the Main activity of the program, like it is running on the background.. here in my code I just want to change the Textview but when I run it on my android it states that unfortunately the app stopped.public class BluetoothOn {private void initializeBlue(){    textView1 =(TextView)findViewById(R.id.textView1);    textView1.setText(BleisOn);}}Please take note that I have compiled this program with no error/ all variables are declared. I have tried to create the Bluetooth class as private on the Main and it works. I just want to create it as another class on the package for organizing my code.Is it really necessary that I have to create another activity if I want to create a separate class? Can anyone give me hints what should I do or declare? Please help thank you.Update: thank you for all your answers, unfortunately I can't make this simple process to work on another class...

The AsyncTask is supposed to perform a long running task and then update a TextView in the UI.\n-> I have a button click event that starts an AsyncTask:\nButton button = (Button) findViewById(R.id.button);\nbutton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {\n    public void onClick(View view) {\n        new MyAsyncTask().execute();\n    }\n});\n\n-> MyAsyncTask class:\nprivate class MyAsyncTask extends AsyncTask<Void, Void, String> {\n    @Override\n    protected String doInBackground(Void... params) {\n        // Perform long running task here\n        return \"Task Completed\";\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onPostExecute(String result) {\n        TextView textView = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.textView);\n        textView.setText(result);\n    }\n}\n\n-> The problem is that the TextView is not updated. What am I doing wrong?\nAnswer: The problem is that you are trying to update the TextView from a non-UI thread. In Android, you must not update the UI from a background thread. The AsyncTask.onPostExecute() method is run on the UI thread, so you can safely update the UI here.\n\nHere is the corrected code:\nButton button = (Button) findViewById(R.id.button);\nbutton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {\n    public void onClick(View view) {\n        new MyAsyncTask().execute();\n    }\n});\n\nprivate class MyAsyncTask extends AsyncTask<Void, Void, String> {\n    @Override\n    protected String doInBackground(Void... params) {\n        // Perform long running task here\n        return \"Task Completed\";\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onPostExecute(String result) {\n        TextView textView = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.textView);\n        textView.setText(result);\n    }\n}\n\nQuestion: How to use AsyncTask in Android to perform network operations?:\nI have a button click event that starts an AsyncTask.
