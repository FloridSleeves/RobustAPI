It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time.

Improve this question                    Does anyone have an example of an SSH library connection using Java.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: There are several SSH libraries available for Java, such as JSch, Bastillion, etc. Here's an example of how to use JSch:\n\n```java\nimport com.jcraft.jsch.*;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String user = \"username\";\n        String host = \"localhost\";\n        int port = 22;\n        String password = \"password\";\n\n        try {\n            JSch jsch = new JSch();\n            Session session = jsch.getSession(user, host, port);\n            session.setPassword(password);\n\n            java.util.Properties config = new java.util.Properties();\n            config.put(\"StrictHostKeyChecking\", \"no\");\n            session.setConfig(config);\n\n            session.connect();\n            Channel channel = session.openChannel(\"shell\");\n            channel.connect();\n\n            InputStream in = channel.getInputStream();\n            byte[] tmp = new byte[1024];\n            while (true) {\n                while (in.available() > 0) {\n                    int i = in.read(tmp, 0, 1024);\n                    if (i < 0) break;\n                    System.out.print(new String(tmp, 0, i));\n                }\n                if (channel.isClosed()) {\n                    System.out.println(\"exit-status: \" + channel.getExitStatus());\n                    break;\n                }\n                try {\n                    Thread.sleep(1000);\n                } catch (Exception ee) {\n                }\n            }\n            channel.disconnect();\n            session.disconnect();\n        } catch (JSchException e) {\n            System.out.print(\"Exception \" + e);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code connects to an SSH server, opens a shell channel, and reads from the input stream.\n\nPlease replace \"username\", \"localhost\", \"password\" with your actual username, host, and password.\n\nThis is a basic example and doesn't handle all possible exceptions, but it should give you a good starting point.\n\nFor more advanced usage, you may want to look at the JSch documentation and examples.\n\nNote: JSch is a popular SSH library for Java, but there are many others available as well.\n\nPlease using this api: JSch.\nQuestion: Android InputStream.read() horribly slow: :Closed.
