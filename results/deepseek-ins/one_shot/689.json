But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: calling system command from java program fails to execute: :Hi i tried to execute the following command from java code in linux,ls > out.txthere is my codetry             {                 Process p=Runtime.getRuntime().exec(\"ls > out.txt\");                 p.waitFor();                 BufferedReader reader=new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(p.getInputStream()));                 String line=reader.readLine();                 while(line!=null)                 {                 System.out.println(line);                 line=reader.readLine();                 }             }             catch(IOException e1) {}             catch(InterruptedException e2) {}             System.out.println(\"Done\"); I checked output file was not generated.

The \">\" operator is a shell redirection operator, not a command that can be executed from Java. You should use the ProcessBuilder class to execute the command and redirect the output to a file.\nQuestion: How to get the current date and time in java:\n\nPlease using this api: java.time.LocalDateTime.now.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: java.time.LocalDateTime.now\n<<<code>>>: java.time.LocalDateTime now = java.time.LocalDateTime.now();\n<<<explanation>>>: The java.time.LocalDateTime.now() method returns the current date and time. It is part of the java.time package introduced in Java 8.\nQuestion: How to get the current date in java:\n\nPlease using this api: java.time.LocalDate.now.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: java.time.LocalDate.now\n<<<code>>>: java.time.LocalDate now = java.time.LocalDate.now();\n<<<explanation>>>: The java.time.LocalDate.now() method returns the current date.
