But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Delete an entry from property file: :How to delete key and value from property file?

It buffers the input, making the performance fast. The FileReader is used to read character data from a file.\nQuestion: How to write to a file in Java:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nPrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(\"filename.txt\", \"UTF-8\");\npw.println(\"Hello, World!\");\npw.close();\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: PrintWriter is a class in java that is used to print formatted representations of objects to a text-output stream. The FileWriter is used to write character data to a file. The \"UTF-8\" is used to specify the character encoding.\nQuestion: How to read a file line by line in Java:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nBufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"filename.txt\"));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\nbr.close();\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: BufferedReader is a class in java that is used to read character data from a reader. It buffers the input, making the performance fast. The FileReader is used to read character data from a file. The while loop continues until there are no more lines to read.\nQuestion: How to write to a file line by line in Java:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nPrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(\"filename.txt\", \"UTF-8\");\npw.println(\"First line\");\npw.println(\"Second line\");\npw.println(\"Third line\");\npw.close();\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: PrintWriter is a class in java that is used to print formatted representations of objects to a text-output stream. The FileWriter is used to write character data to a file. The \"UTF-8\" is used to specify the character encoding. The println method is used to write a line to the file.\nQuestion: How to read a file character by character in Java:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileReader\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nFileReader fr = new FileReader(\"filename.txt\");\nint i;\nwhile ((i = fr.read()) != -1) {\n    System.out.print((char) i);\n}\nfr.close();\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: FileReader is a class in java that is used to read character data from a file. The read method returns an integer which represents the character read, or -1 if the end of the file is reached. The while loop continues until the end of the file is reached. The (char) i cast is used to convert the integer to a character before printing it.\nQuestion: How to write to a file character by character in Java:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileWriter\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nFileWriter fw = new FileWriter(\"filename.txt\");\nfw.write('H');\nfw.write('e');\nfw.write('l');\nfw.write('l');\nfw.write('o');\nfw.close();\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: FileWriter is a class in java that is used to write character data to a file. The write method is used to write a single character. The close method is used to close the file.\nQuestion: How to read a file byte by byte in Java:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileInputStream\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nFileInputStream fis = new"}
