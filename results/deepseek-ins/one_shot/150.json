It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block.

Then you split the hex string on the two right parenthesis and carriage return sequence. This will give you an array of hex strings.\n\nA: The problem is that you are reading one byte at a time, which is very slow. You should read the data into a buffer and then process it. Here is an example of how you can do it:\n\n```java\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\nint bytesRead;\nStringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder();\nwhile ((bytesRead = is.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n    String hexString = DatatypeConverter.printHexBinary(buffer, 0, bytesRead);\n    stringBuilder.append(hexString);\n}\nString hexData = stringBuilder.toString();\nString[] hexStrings = hexData.split(\"5d5d0d\");\n```\n\nThis code reads data into a buffer, converts it to a hex string, and then splits the hex string on the two right parenthesis and carriage return sequence. This will give you an array of hex strings.\n\nPlease note that the hex string \"5d5d0d\" corresponds to the characters \"))\" and \"\\r\" in ASCII. If you want to split the data based on these characters, you should use \"5d5d0d\" as the delimiter in the split method.\n\nAlso, make sure to handle exceptions properly in your code. The code above does not handle exceptions, but you should add appropriate try-catch blocks to handle potential exceptions.\n\nLastly, remember to close the InputStream when you are done with it to free up system resources. You can do this by calling the close() method on the InputStream object.\n\n```java\nis.close();\n```\n\nI hope this helps you solve your problem. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.\n\nPlease note that the code above assumes that the server sends the data in chunks of 1024 bytes. If the server sends data in a different size, you should adjust the buffer size accordingly.\n\nAlso, please note that the code above uses the DatatypeConverter class from the javax.xml.bind.DatatypeConverter package to convert the byte array to a hex string. If you are using an older version of Java that does not include this class, you will need to implement your own method for converting the byte array to a hex string.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n"}
