When you add a byte to an int, it is promoted to int and the result is the int value. So, if the byte is negative, it is sign-extended to int, and the result is 256 added to the byte value. To get the correct sum, you should use the bitwise AND operator with 0xFF to ensure that the byte value is in the range 0 to 255.\nQuestion: How to read a large file in chunks in Java: :I'm trying to read a large file in chunks.

However, for large files, you should read in larger chunks to avoid running out of memory. The size of the buffer should be chosen based on the available memory and the size of the file. 8192 bytes (8KB) is a good starting point, but you may need to adjust it depending on your specific situation.\nQuestion: How to read a large file in chunks in Java: :I'm trying to read a large file in chunks.

Instead, you should read a larger buffer and process the data in chunks. Here's an example:\n\n```java\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[8192];\nint bytesRead;\nwhile ((bytesRead = is.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n    // process the data in buffer\n}\n```\n\nThis will read up to 8192 bytes at a time, which is more efficient than reading one"}
