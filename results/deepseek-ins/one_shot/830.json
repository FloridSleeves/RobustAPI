The first time you use it to empty the file, you should set the append parameter to false. After that, you can use it to append data to the file by setting the append parameter to true.\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader\n<<<code>>>: try { FileReader fileReader = new FileReader(\"file.txt\"); BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(fileReader); String line; while ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) { System.out.println(line); } bufferedReader.close(); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The FileReader class is used to read data from a file. It is a character-oriented class, which is used for reading character files. The BufferedReader class is used for buffering characters. It makes the performance fast by storing characters in a buffer.\nQuestion: How to write to a file in Java:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileWriter\n<<<code>>>: try { FileWriter fileWriter = new FileWriter(\"file.txt\"); fileWriter.write(\"Hello, World!\"); fileWriter.close(); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The FileWriter class is used for writing character-oriented data to a file. It is a character-stream class, which is used for writing character-output streams to files. The constructor of this class takes a file name or a File object. If the second argument is true, then it will append data to the file. If it is false, then it will overwrite the existing data in the file.\n\n\nA: The problem is that you are not sending newline characters (\"\\n\") between your lines. The BufferedReader.readLine() method reads until it encounters a newline character, so it stops reading after the first newline it encounters.\nYou can fix this by adding newline characters (\"\\n\") after each line you write:\nprintWriter.write(\"1\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\\n\");\n\nThen, when you read the lines, you should use the BufferedReader.readLine() method in a loop:\nString line;\nwhile ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n\nThis will read each line separately until there are no more lines to read.\n\nA: You are writing each line as a separate string. When you read the lines, you are reading them as a single string. You need to separate the lines when you write them and read them separately.\nHere is how you can do it:\nServer side:\nPrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true);\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\nClient side:\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n\nIn the server side, the printWriter.println() method automatically adds a newline character at the end of each string, so each line is sent separately. In the client side, the bufferedReader.readLine() method reads the next line from the input stream, so you can read each line separately.\n\nA: You are writing each line as a separate string.
