The problem is that UTF-8 can't represent all Unicode characters, especially those outside the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP).\nThe characters you're seeing (\ud83d\ude02 and =) are not valid UTF-8 sequences, so they're being replaced with these replacement characters.\nTo fix this, you need to ensure that you're sending the text as UTF-8 encoded bytes, but also ensure that the receiving end is interpreting the data as UTF-8.\nIn your Volley request, you're already doing this with the line:\ndataOutputStream.write(parameterValue.getBytes(\"UTF-8\"));\n\nThis line is converting the string to UTF-8 bytes, which should solve your problem.\nIf you're still having issues, it might be due to how the data is being interpreted on the receiving end. You should check the documentation for the API you're using to make sure it's interpreting the data correctly.\n\nA: The problem is not with Volley or the way you're sending the request, but with how you're interpreting the data.\nWhen you're sending text that contains emojis, you're sending it as UTF-8 encoded bytes.
