It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Decrypting a CipherInputStream results in an empty stream: :I seem to be have an issue with JCE. I create an CipherInputStream using an encrypting JCE cipher which I then use to create another CipherInputStream using a different decrypting JCE cipher.When I try to read then second stream all I get is empty data. I found no documentation forbidding the above behavior.

You should read from it in a loop until it returns -1, which indicates that there is no more data. The read method will return the number of bytes read, which you can use to process the data in the buffer.\n\nA: The problem is that you are reading one byte at a time. This is very inefficient. Instead, you should read the data into a larger buffer and then process it. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```java\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint bytesRead;\nwhile ((bytesRead = is.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n    // process buffer\n}\n```\n\nThis way, you read the data into the buffer in larger chunks, which is much more efficient. The `read(byte[] b)` method of `InputStream` reads up to b.length bytes of data from the input stream into an array of bytes. The number of bytes read is returned. If the end of the stream is reached, -1 is returned.\n\nAlso, you should check the return value of `is.read(buffer)` to see if you have read all the data. If you only read the first byte, you will miss the rest.\n\nFinally, you should close the input stream when you are done with it. This can be done by calling `is.close()`.\n\nAlso, make sure that the server is sending data at a rate that matches the buffer size. If the server is sending data too slowly, the buffer will fill up and you will have to wait for more data to arrive. If the server is sending data too fast, you will have to read the data and discard it before you can read more.\n\nAlso, make sure that the server is sending the data correctly. If the server is sending incorrect data, the `read(byte[] b)` method will return before it has read all the data.\n\nFinally, make sure that the server is not sending more data than it should be sending. If the server is sending more data than it should be sending, the `read(byte[] b)` method will return after it has read all the data.\n\nI hope this helps.
