The first call advances the iterator, but the second call still points to the same element. You should call tr.next() only once per iteration.\n\nA: The issue is with this line:\nnames.add(dataSnapshot.getChildren().iterator().next().getValue(String.class));\n\nInside the loop, you're creating a new iterator for each child in dataSnapshot.getChildren(). This means that you're always getting the first child's value, because you're calling next() on the iterator of the first child.\nInstead, you should use the iterator of the current child in the loop:\nfor (DataSnapshot dataSnapshot1:dataSnapshot.getChildren()) {\n    i = i + 1;\n    names.add(dataSnapshot1.getValue(String.class));\n}\n\nThis way, you're getting the value of the current child in the loop.\n\nA: You are creating a new iterator for each child in dataSnapshot.getChildren().
