This is how the BufferedReader knows when one line ends and another begins.\n\nA: The problem is that you are not sending newline characters (\\n or \\r\\n) between your lines. The BufferedReader reads until it finds a newline character, so it stops reading after the first character.\nYou should change your code to:\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\\n\");\n\nThis will ensure that each line is followed by a newline character, and the BufferedReader will correctly read each line.\n\nA: You are writing each line without a newline character.
