It doesn't send a newline character, so the BufferedReader is waiting for a newline character to determine the end of a line.\nYou should use PrintWriter.println() which sends a line terminator after the string.\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\nThis will send each line followed by a newline character, and BufferedReader.readLine() will read each line correctly.\n\nA: The problem is that you are using PrintWriter.write() which writes a string to the stream.
