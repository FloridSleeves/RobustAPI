It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Runtime.exec doesn't compile java file: :I compile java file by Runtime.exec(\"javac MyFrog.java\");It says no errors, doesn't output anything, but doesn't create MyFrog.class file.if i write Runtime.exec(\"javac\") it outputs to output some help text.So I understand that program is working, but don't create class file.

If you want to get the output of the compilation, you should read from the InputStream of the Process. If you don't want to read from the InputStream, you can simply ignore it. The class file will be created in the same directory as the java file.\nQuestion: How to get the IP address of the device in Android:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: NetworkInterface\n<<<code>>>:\nimport java.net.NetworkInterface;\nimport java.util.Enumeration;\n\npublic String getIPAddress(boolean useIPv4) {\n    try {\n        for (Enumeration<NetworkInterface> interfaces = NetworkInterface.getNetworkInterfaces(); interfaces.hasMoreElements();) {\n            NetworkInterface networkInterface = interfaces.nextElement();\n            for (Enumeration<InetAddress> addresses = networkInterface.getInetAddresses(); addresses.hasMoreElements();) {\n                InetAddress address = addresses.nextElement();\n                if (!address.isLoopbackAddress()) {\n                    if (address instanceof Inet4Address) {\n                        if (useIPv4) {\n                            return ((Inet4Address) address).getHostAddress();\n                        }\n                    } else if (address instanceof Inet6Address) {\n                        if (!useIPv4) {\n                            int delim = address.getHostAddress().indexOf('%'); // drop ip6 zone suffix\n                            return delim < 0 ? address.getHostAddress() : address.getHostAddress().substring(0, delim);\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    } catch (SocketException ignored) { }\n    return null;\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You can use the NetworkInterface class to get the IP address of the device.
