If the key is not already in the map, it will add it with the specified value. If the key is already in the map, it will replace the old value with the new one.\nHere is an example:\nMap<String, Integer> freq = new HashMap<String, Integer>();\nString word = \"example\";\n\nif (freq.containsKey(word)) {\n    freq.put(word, freq.get(word) + 1);\n} else {\n    freq.put(word, 1);\n}\n\nThis code will increment the value associated with the key \"example\" in the map freq. If the key \"example\" does not exist in the map, it will add it with a value of 1.\n\nA: You can use the Map.compute() method which is available since Java 8. It takes a key and a BiFunction which is applied to the value of the key if it exists or the default value if it doesn't.\nHere is an example:\nMap<String, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();\nString word = \"example\";\n\nfreq.compute(word, (k, v) -> v == null ? 1 : v + 1);\n\nThis code will increment the value associated with the key \"example\" in the map"}
