But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: How to save the text file in a path given by JFileChooser?: :I need to save a text File which is already created in a particular path given by JFileChooser.

You can get the selected file from the JFileChooser using chooser.getSelectedFile(). Make sure to close the writer after you're done with it to free up resources.\n\n\nA: You are writing to the PrintWriter, which is a character-oriented stream. When you write \"1\", \"2\", and \"3\" without a newline character, they are all written to the stream as a single string. When you read from the BufferedReader, it reads until it encounters a newline character, which it finds after reading \"1\", so it returns \"1\".\nYou need to write each line with a newline character at the end. You can do this by calling println() instead of write():\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\nThis will write each string followed by a newline character, so when you read from the BufferedReader, it will return each line separately.\n\nA: You are writing to the PrintWriter, which is a character-oriented stream.
