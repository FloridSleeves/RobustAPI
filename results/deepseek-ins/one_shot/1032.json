It simply returns the next token from the string. If there are multiple consecutive delimiters, it will return an empty string.\nIf you want to include empty fields, you should use String.split() instead. It will return an array of strings, including empty fields.\nHere is an example:\nString strLine = \"one->two->->three\";\nString[] fields = strLine.split(\"->\");\nfor (String field : fields) {\n    System.out.println(field);\n}\n\nThis will output:\none\ntwo\n\n(empty string)\n\nthree\n\nNote that the (empty string) is the third field, not the second. This is because the split method treats consecutive delimiters as a single delimiter.\n\nA: The StringTokenizer class in Java does not skip over empty fields.
