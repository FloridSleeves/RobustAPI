First, you need to seek to the end of the file using seek(length()). Then, you can read the last character using read().\nQuestion: How to read a file in reverse order in Java: I have a file that I want to read in reverse order. I've tried using RandomAccessFile, but it doesn't seem to support seeking backwards. Is there a way to do this without using RandomAccessFile?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file));String line;Stack<String> stack = new Stack<String>();while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {    stack.push(line);}while (!stack.isEmpty()) {    System.out.println(stack.pop());}\n<<<explanation>>>: You can use a BufferedReader to read the file line by line and push each line into a Stack. Then you can pop the lines from the stack to print them in reverse order. This way, you don't need to seek backwards in the file.\n\nA: Here is a simple way to read the last n bytes of a file in Java:\nRandomAccessFile raf = new RandomAccessFile(file, \"r\");\nraf.seek(raf.length() - n);\nbyte[] bytes = new byte[n];\nraf.read(bytes);\n\nThis code opens the file in read mode, seeks to the end of the file and then reads the last n bytes.
