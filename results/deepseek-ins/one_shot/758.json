JSONArray constructor expects a List or an array, not a Map. If you want to convert a List of Maps to a JSONArray, you need to iterate over the list and add each map to a new JSONObject, then add that JSONObject to the JSONArray.\n\n\nA: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\n\nYou can solve this by adding a line break character (\"\\n\") after each write.\n\nprintWriter.write(\"1\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\\n\");\n\nThen, when reading from the BufferedReader, you should call readLine() multiple times to read all the lines.\n\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine()); // prints \"1\"\nSystem.out."}
