It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Using JMeter TCP Sampler is it possible to determine message length using first bytes of the response: :I need some help on identifying the length of the response using the the first byte(s) of the message.

The communication protocol is Google Protobufs (protocol buffers) and does not have an indicator to determine the end of message. Below is what Jmeter has.

And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\n\nA: The problem is that you are reading one byte at a time, which is very inefficient. You should read the entire buffer at once.\nHere is a modified version of your code:\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read(buffer, i, buffer.length - i);\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    i += b;\n\n    if (i == 3)\n    {\n        length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n        break;\n    }\n}\n\nThis code reads the entire buffer at once, and then processes the bytes as needed. It also updates the index i as it reads, so you don't have to allocate a new array for each read.\nAlso, you should check if the read operation returns -1 to indicate that the end of the stream has been reached. If it does, you should break out of the loop.\nFinally, if the length is determined by the first 4 bytes, you should break out of the loop after determining the length.\n\nA: The problem is that you are reading one byte at a time, which is very inefficient.

Instead, you read it in chunks and store it in a ByteArrayOutputStream, which can handle arbitrarily large amounts of data.\n\nA: You can use"}
