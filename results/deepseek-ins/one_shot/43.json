From the ApplicationInfo, you can get the label (name of the application) and icon using loadLabel() and loadIcon() methods.\nHere is an example:\nPackageManager packageManager = getPackageManager();\ntry {\n    ApplicationInfo applicationInfo = packageManager.getApplicationInfo(\"com.google.android.apps.maps\", 0);\n    String appName = applicationInfo.loadLabel(packageManager).toString();\n    Drawable appIcon = applicationInfo.loadIcon(packageManager);\n} catch (PackageManager.NameNotFoundException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n\nIn this code, replace \"com.google.android.apps.maps\" with the package name of the application you want to get the info about.\nNote: If the package name is changed by the application's developer in future, you will have to update your code to reflect the new package name.\n\nA: You can use PackageManager to get the ApplicationInfo of an installed package.
