It's a bit more efficient than parsing each document individually because it can coalesce multiple documents into one, reducing the number of parsing operations. You can split the file into separate documents by using the \"<DOC>\" delimiter. Then you can parse each document and get the values of the <TEXT> nodes.\n\nA: The problem is not with InputStream.read() but with the way you are reading the data. You are reading one byte at a time which is very inefficient. You should read the entire buffer at once and then process it. Here is an example of how you can do it:\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint bytesRead;\nwhile ((bytesRead = is.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n    // process the data in buffer\n}\n\nThis will read the data into the buffer and then you can process it. If you are processing the data byte by byte, you should also process the data in the buffer byte by byte.\nAlso, you should consider using a BufferedInputStream to improve the performance of your InputStream.read() calls.\nBufferedInputStream bis = new BufferedInputStream(client.getInputStream());\n\nThis will use a buffer internally to improve the performance of your read calls.\n\nA: I'm not sure if you're asking about the speed of InputStream.read() or the speed of parsing XML documents.\n\n*\n\n*If you're asking about the speed of InputStream.read(), you're already using a buffer to read data into, which is a good approach. The buffer size you're using (1MB) is quite large, but if you're still experiencing slow performance, you might want to consider using a smaller buffer size.\n\n*If you're asking about the speed of parsing XML documents, you're using the DocumentBuilderFactory which is a good approach. However, you're also reading the entire XML document into a string, which is inefficient if you only need to parse a small part of the document. Instead, you should read and parse the document in chunks.\n\nHere's an example of how you can do this:\n\n```java\nDocumentBuilderFactory factory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();\nDocumentBuilder builder = factory.newDocumentBuilder();\n\nInputStream is = new FileInputStream(\"yourfile.xml\");\n\n// Read the whole file into a string\nStringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\nint bytesNumRead = 0;\nwhile ((bytesNumRead = is.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n    sb.append(new String(buffer, 0, bytesNumRead));\n}\n\nString xml = sb.toString();\n\n// Split the string into separate XML documents\nString[] xmlDocuments = xml.split(\"<DOC>\");\nfor (String doc : xmlDocuments) {\n    if (doc.trim"}
