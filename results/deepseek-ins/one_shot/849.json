The last 6 bytes in my files contain crucial information when writing the files back. I need to write my original files, and then append the last 6 bytes elsewhere. Any guidance? Thanks\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: RandomAccessFile.read\n<<<code>>>: RandomAccessFile randomAccessFile = new RandomAccessFile(your_file, \"r\");randomAccessFile.seek(your_file.length() - n);try{randomAccessFile.read(byteArray, 0, n);} catch(IOException e) {e.printStackTrace();} \n<<<explanation>>>: You have to do it by using RandomAccessFile. Instances of this class support both reading and writing to a random access file. A random access file behaves like a large array of bytes stored in the file system. \nQuestion: Gets the uncompressed size of this GZIPInputStream?: :I have a GZIPInputStream that I constructed from another ByteArrayInputStream. I want to know the original (uncompressed) length for the gzip data. Although I can read to the end of the GZIPInputStream, then count the number, it will cost much time and waste CPU. I would like to know the size before read it.Is there a similiar method like ZipEntry.getSize() for GZIPInputStream:public long getSize ()Since: API Level 1  Gets the uncompressed size of this ZipEntry.\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How do I read the last \"n\" bytes of a file in Java: How do I read the last n number of bytes from a file, without using RandomAccessFile.

The header field \"original-size\" contains the size of the original uncompressed data.\n\nA: You can use RandomAccessFile to read the last n bytes of a file. Here is an example:\n\nRandomAccessFile randomAccessFile = new RandomAccessFile(your_file, \"r\");\nrandomAccessFile.seek(your_file.length() - n);\nbyte[] byteArray = new byte[n];\nrandomAccessFile.read(byteArray, 0, n);\n\nIn this code, you first create a RandomAccessFile object with the file you want to read and the mode \"r\" for read. Then you use the seek method to move the file pointer to the end of the file and then move it n bytes back. Finally, you create a byte array of size n and read the last n bytes into this array.\n\nA: You can use RandomAccessFile to read the last n bytes of a file.

Then you use the seek method to move the file pointer to the end of the file and then move it n bytes back. Finally, you create a byte array of size n and read the last n bytes into this array.\n\nFor your second question, GZIPInputStream does not have a method to get the original size of the uncompressed data. However, you can get the size of the compressed data by using the getSize() method of the ZipEntry class. Here is an example:\n\nGZIPInputStream gis = new GZIPInputStream(new ByteArrayInputStream(your_byte_array));\nZipInputStream zis = new ZipInputStream(gis);\nZipEntry entry = zis.getNextEntry();\nlong size = entry.getSize();\n\nIn this code, you first create a GZIPInputStream from the byte array. Then you create a ZipInputStream from the GZIPInputStream. You then call getNextEntry() to get the ZipEntry from the ZipInputStream. Finally, you call getSize() on the ZipEntry to get the size of the compressed data.\n\nPlease note that the getSize() method returns the size of the compressed data, not the size of the uncompressed data.\n\nI hope this helps. Let me know if you have any further questions.\n\nA: To read the last n bytes of a file in Java, you can use the RandomAccessFile class.
