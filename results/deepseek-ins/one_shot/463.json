Then, we count the frequency of each character using a HashMap. We then sort the list of characters based on the frequency and original index. The sort function uses a custom comparator that first compares the frequency of the characters, and then compares the original index of the characters if the frequencies are equal.\n\n\nA: The issue is that you are using the same iterator for all children in your loop.
