But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Exporting variables with multiple values?: :import java.util.*;import java.text.*;import java.io.*;public class AvgTime {static double hrs1;static double min1;public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException, FileNotFoundException {Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);System.out.print(\"How many times? \");int numOfTimes = in.nextInt();double hrTotal = 0;double minTotal = 0;for (int i = 1; i <= numOfTimes; i++){  System.out.println(\"\\nEnter time in military time notation: \");  System.out.print(\"Hour  \");  double hrs1 = in.nextDouble();  System.out.print(\"Minute  \");  double min1 = in.nextDouble();  hrTotal += hrs1;  minTotal += min1;}//calculate averagedouble avgHr1 = hrTotal/numOfTimes;double timeMin1 = Math.round(minTotal/numOfTimes);DecimalFormat df = new DecimalFormat(\"###\");String hours = df.format(avgHr1);String minutes = df.format(timeMin1);String time = hours+\":\"+minutes+\":\"+00;String mt = hours+minutes;    SimpleDateFormat fmtMil = new SimpleDateFormat(\"HH:mm:ss\");    Date inDate = fmtMil.parse(time, new ParsePosition(0));    SimpleDateFormat fmtAMPM = new SimpleDateFormat(\"hh:mm:ss aa\");    StringBuffer outDate = fmtAMPM.format(inDate, new StringBuffer(), new FieldPosition(0));System.out.println(\"\\nThe average time is \" + outDate+\"\\n\"+mt+\" in military time.\\n\\n\");    String copy = \"Copying...\";    Thread.sleep( 550 );    for( int i = 0; i < copy.length(); i++ ) {        System.out.print(copy.charAt( i ) );         try{ Thread.sleep( 105 ); }catch( Exception e ){}        }        PrintWriter p = new PrintWriter(\"Times.txt\");           p.println(hrs1+min1);            p.close();        System.out.println(\"\\nDone\\n\\n\\n\");            Thread.sleep( 550 );  }}I want it to export to a file the times entered by the user.

I want to read the file and store each line in a list.\n\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"path/to/file.txt\"))) { List<String> lines = new ArrayList<>(); String line; while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) { lines.add(line); } } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: You can use a BufferedReader to read a file line by line. You create a new BufferedReader with a FileReader that takes the path to your file as a parameter. Then you create an empty list to store the lines. You read the first line with br.readLine() and store it in the variable line. If the line is not null (which means the end of the file has not been reached), you add the line to the list and read the next line. This process repeats until the end of the file is reached.\nQuestion: How to use a BufferedWriter to write multiple lines to a file in Java?:\nI have a list of strings and I want to write each string to a file.\n\nPlease using this api: BufferedWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try (BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(\"path/to/file.txt\"))) { List<String> lines = Arrays.asList(\"line1\", \"line2\", \"line3\"); for (String line : lines) { bw.write(line); bw.newLine(); } } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: You can use a BufferedWriter to write to a file. You create a new BufferedWriter with a FileWriter that takes the path to your file as a parameter. Then you create a list of strings. You iterate over the list and for each string, you write it to the file and add a newline character with bw.newLine(). This process repeats until all lines have been written.\nQuestion: How to use a BufferedReader to read a specific line from a file in Java?:\nI have a file with multiple lines and I want to read a specific line.\n\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"path/to/file.txt\"))) { String line; for (int i = 0; (line = br.readLine()) != null; i++) { if (i == 5) { System.out.println(line); break; } } } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: You can use a BufferedReader to read a file line by line. You create a new BufferedReader with a FileReader that takes the path to your file as a parameter. Then you read the first line with br.readLine() and store it in the variable line. If the line is not null (which means the end of the file has not been reached), you check if the line number is the one you want (in this case, line number 5). If it is, you print the line and break the loop. If it isn't, you read the next line and repeat the process. This process repeats until the end of the file is reached or you find the line you want.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
