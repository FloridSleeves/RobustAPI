But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\n\nYou should use printWriter.println() instead of printWriter.write() to write a line to the stream. printWriter.println() automatically appends a line separator at the end of the line.\n\nHere is the corrected code:\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\nprintWriter.flush();\n\nAnd then you can read the lines like this:\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\n\nThis should print \"1\" as expected.\n\nA: The problem is that you are not sending a line break after each write. The BufferedReader is waiting for a line break to determine the end of a line.\nYou can solve this by using printWriter.println() instead of printWriter.write(). printWriter.println() automatically appends a line separator at the end of the line.\nHere is the corrected code:\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\nprintWriter.flush();\n\nAnd then you can read the lines like this:\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\n\nThis should print \"1\" as expected.\n\nA: The problem is that you are not sending a line break after each write.
