It should be:\nFile dir = new File(path + \"/\" + nameFolder);\n\nAlso, you should use mkdirs() instead of mkdir() because mkdir() only creates the directory if it does not exist, but mkdirs() creates the directory and any necessary parent directories.\nSo, your corrected code would be:\npublic void makeDirectory(String path, String nameFolder) {\n    File dir = new File(path + \"/\" + nameFolder);\n    dir.mkdirs();\n}\n\nThis code will create the directory at the specified path if it does not exist. If the parent directories do not exist, they will also be created.\n\nA: You are using the wrong slash in your File path. Use forward slash (/) instead of backslash (\\).\npublic void makeDirectory(String path, String nameFolder) {\n    File dir = new File(path + \"/\" + nameFolder);\n    dir.mkdirs();\n}\n\n\nA: The problem is with the slash you are using in your File path. You should use forward"}
