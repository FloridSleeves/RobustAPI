The cost increases dramatically by using \"rwd\" instead of \"rw\" which should be enough to indicate its not the calls themselves which cost the time. (its the fact the OS is try to commit every write to disk and the disk only spins so fast)\nQuestion: How to append to AES encrypted file: :I'm writing some kind of logger that produces encrypted log-file. Unfortunately, cryptography is not my strong side. Now I can write to file several messages and then close file. Then i can open it, append some messages, close again and after decryption I see padding bytes in the middle of file. Is there any way to work with encrypted file without having to decrypt it every time I want to append some messages?EDIT: little more details. Current implementation utlizes CipherOutputStream. As i understand there's no way to seek using it.Can i use 'NoPadding' option if i will control that output data size is divisible by block size?\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Why is RandomAccessFile writeLong implemented with multiple write calls?: While profiling an application I noticed that RandomAccessFile.writeLong was taking a lot of time.\n\nI checked the code for this method, and it involves eight calls of the native method write.

It's a good choice for encrypting data. You can write to it as if it were a regular OutputStream. However, it doesn't support seeking. If you need to append to the file, you'll have to read the entire file into memory, append your data, then write the entire file back out. This can be inefficient for large files.\n\nIf you want to append to the file without decrypting it, you'll have to encrypt your data separately, then append the encrypted data to the file.
