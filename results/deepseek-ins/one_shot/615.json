Then we add the value to the list. If the key already exists, we get the list and add the value to it.\n\nA: You can use the Map.get() method to get the current count of a word, and then use Map.put() to update the count. If the word is not in the map, you can use Map.put() to add it with a count of 1. Here is the code:\nMap<String, Integer> freq = new HashMap<String, Integer>();\nString word = \"yourWord\";\nInteger count = freq.get(word);\nif (count == null) {\n    freq.put(word, 1);\n} else {\n    freq.put(word, count + 1);\n}\n\nThis code will increment the count of the word in the map. If the word is not in the map, it will add it with a count of 1.\n\nFor your second question, you can use the same approach as the first one. You can get the ArrayList from the map, and then add the new value to the ArrayList. If the key does not exist in the map, you can create a new ArrayList, add the value to it, and then put it in the map. Here is the code:\nMap<String, ArrayList<Object>> map = new HashMap<String, ArrayList<Object>>();\nString key = \"yourKey\";\nArrayList<Object> list = map.get(key);\nif (list == null) {\n    list = new ArrayList<Object>();\n    map.put(key, list);\n}\nlist.add(value);\n\nThis code will append the new value to the ArrayList in the map. If the key does not exist in the map, it will create a new ArrayList, add the value to it, and then put it in the map.\n\nA: You can use the Map.computeIfAbsent() method to create a new ArrayList if the key does not exist, and then add the value to the ArrayList. Here is the code:\nMap<String, ArrayList<Object>> map = new HashMap<String, ArrayList<Object>>();\nString key = \"yourKey\";\nArrayList<Object> list = map.computeIfAbsent(key, k -> new ArrayList<Object>());\nlist.add(value);\n\nThis code will append the new value to the ArrayList in the map.
