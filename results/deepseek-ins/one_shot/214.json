It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Reading all string from a server socket which has not been closed: :I have a problem with socket programming in Java.

It uses the underlying Reader to read characters into a buffer. It stops when it encounters a line separator, which is any of a line separator characters or a carriage return followed immediately by a newline. It then returns the string that has been read. If the end of the stream is reached, the value null is returned. This is a more efficient way to read lines of text from an InputStream than using read() and then parsing the result.\nQuestion: How to handle socket programming in Android: :I'm trying to implement a socket programming in Android. I have a server running on my PC and I want to connect to it from my Android device. I have written a client-side code in Java which connects to the server and sends a message.

It is used by a server to accept incoming connections from clients. The server creates a ServerSocket object and binds it to a specific port number. The server then listens for incoming connections on that port. When a client connects to the server, the server accepts the connection and creates a Socket object to handle the communication with the client. The ServerSocket.accept() method is used to accept the connection.\nQuestion: How to handle socket programming in Android: :I'm trying to implement a socket programming in Android.

This means that it will keep running until it gets a -1 from the read() method, which it never will because you are only reading one byte at a time.\nInstead, you should use a loop that continues until you have read the desired amount of bytes.\nHere is a modified version of your code:\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\n"}
