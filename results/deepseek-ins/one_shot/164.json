It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Child Process will neither complete nor abort in Windows?: :How to make my java parent process wait till child process gets completed. I have tried with runtime.exec and with processBuilder.pb: String cmd = \"ffmpeg -i input.vob output.mp4\" Runtime rt = Runtime.getRuntime();Process proc = rt.exec(cmd); proc.waitFor();This works fine with small input file (say less than 10 Mb). If I give larger input file then program will be hanged. Output file will be partially created and file creation will be hanged and control will not return. Even proc.join(10000); did not give any useful result. Here parent process is terminating before child process (ffmpeg) gets completed.How to overcome this problem?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Android InputStream.read() horribly slow:I'm working on an Android app that needs to communicate with a server (running on my PC) which is also written by me.

Here is my code:\n\nLocationManager locationManager = (LocationManager) getSystemService(Context.LOCATION_SERVICE);\nCriteria criteria = new Criteria();\nString provider = locationManager.getBestProvider(criteria, true);\nLocation location = locationManager.getLastKnownLocation(provider);\n\nif (location != null) {\n    double latitude = location.getLatitude();\n    double longitude = location.getLongitude();\n}\n\nI am getting null pointer exception at location.getLatitude() and location.getLongitude(). What could be the issue?\n\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: LocationManager.getLastKnownLocation\n<<<code>>>: LocationManager locationManager = (LocationManager) getSystemService(Context.LOCATION_SERVICE);\nCriteria criteria = new Criteria();\nString provider = locationManager.getBestProvider(criteria, true);\nLocation location = locationManager.getLastKnownLocation(provider);\n\nif (location != null) {\n    double latitude = location.getLatitude();\n    double longitude = location.getLongitude();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The null pointer exception is likely due to the provider being null. This means that there is no provider that can provide location data. You can use the getBestProvider() method to get the best provider that can provide location data. If the provider is null, you may need to request location permissions from the user.\nQuestion: Android: How to get the current location of the device? : I am trying to get the current location of the device using the LocationManager.
