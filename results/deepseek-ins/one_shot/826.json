First, write the header and footer. Then, write the CSV string. The newline characters are automatically added by the println method.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: How to send a file over a socket:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileInputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: \ntry {\n    File file = new File(\"filename.txt\");\n    FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(file);\n    byte[] buffer = new byte[4096];\n    int bytesRead;\n    while ((bytesRead = fis.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n        outputStream.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);\n    }\n    fis.close();\n} catch (Exception e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You can use a FileInputStream to read the file in chunks. Then, you can write these chunks to the output stream of the socket.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: How to receive a file over a socket:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>: \ntry {\n    FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(\"filename.txt\");\n    byte[] buffer = new byte[4096];\n    int bytesRead;\n    while ((bytesRead = inputStream.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n        fos.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);\n    }\n    fos.close();\n} catch (Exception e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You can use a FileOutputStream to write the received chunks to a file. The input stream of the socket can be used to read the chunks.\n\n\nA: The problem is that you are writing the string without a line break. BufferedReader expects a line break (either \\n, \\r, or \\r\\n) to indicate the end of a line. You can fix this by adding a line break after each write:\nprintWriter.write(\"1\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\\n\");\n\nAlternatively, you can use println, which automatically adds a line break:\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\nBoth of these will ensure that each line is read separately by the BufferedReader.\n\nA: You can use println() method of PrintWriter which automatically appends a newline character at the end of the string.\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\nThis will ensure that each line is read separately by the BufferedReader.\n\nA: You can use println() method of PrintWriter which automatically appends a newline character at the end of the string.\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\nThis will ensure that each line is read separately by the BufferedReader.\n\nA: You can use println() method of PrintWriter which automatically appends a newline character at the end of the string.\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\nThis will ensure that each line is read separately by the BufferedReader.\n\nA: You can use println() method of PrintWriter which automatically appends a newline character at the end of the string.\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\nThis will ensure that each line is read separately by the BufferedReader.\n\nA: You can use println() method of PrintWriter which automatically appends a newline character at the end of the string.\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\nThis will ensure that each line is read separately by the"}
