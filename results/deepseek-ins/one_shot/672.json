The BufferedReader reads until it encounters a line separator, which is not provided in your case.\nYou should write the strings with a line break at the end.\nTry this:\nprintWriter.write(\"1\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\\n\");\n\nThis will ensure that each string is followed by a line break, which the BufferedReader will recognize.\n\nA: You should use printWriter.println() instead of printWriter.write(). println() automatically adds a line separator at the end of the string.\nSo, your code should look like this:\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\n\nA: You should use printWriter.println() instead of printWriter.write(). println() automatically adds a line separator at the end of the string.\nSo, your code should look like this:\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\nThis will ensure that each string is followed by a line break, which the BufferedReader will recognize.\n\nA: You can use printWriter.println() instead of printWriter.write(). println() automatically adds a line separator at the end of the string.\nSo, your code should look like this:\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\nThis will ensure that each string is followed by a line break, which the BufferedReader will recognize.\n\nA: You can use printWriter.println() instead of printWriter.write(). println() automatically adds a line separator at the end of the string.\nSo, your code should look like this:\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\nThis will ensure that each string is followed by a line break, which the BufferedReader will recognize.\n\nA: You can use printWriter.println() instead of printWriter.write(). println() automatically adds a line separator at the end of the string.\nSo, your code should look like this:\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\nThis will ensure that each string is followed by a line break, which the BufferedReader will recognize.\n\nA: You can use printWriter.println() instead of printWriter.write(). println() automatically adds a line separator at the end of the string.\nSo, your code should look like this:\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\nThis will ensure that each string is followed by a line break, which the BufferedReader will recognize.\n\nA: You can use printWriter.println() instead of printWriter.write(). println() automatically adds a line separator at the end of the string.\nSo, your code should look like this:\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\nThis will ensure that each string is followed by a line break, which the BufferedReader will recognize.\n\nA: You can use printWriter.println() instead of printWriter.write(). println() automatically adds a line separator at the end of the string.\nSo, your code should look like this:\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\nThis will ensure that each string is followed by a line"}
