But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Response encoding of Google App Engine (can not change response encoding): :public class FeedUpdaterServlet extends HttpServlet {public void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp)        throws IOException {    PrintWriter out = resp.getWriter();    req.setCharacterEncoding(\"utf-8\");    resp.setLocale(Locale.TAIWAN);    resp.setContentType(\"text/html; charset=utf-8\");    resp.setCharacterEncoding(\"utf-8\");    resp.getWriter().println(\"Hello, world!!@!\");            out.println(\"\u6211\u662f\u4eba\");  //some chinese character    out.println(resp.getCharacterEncoding());    out.flush();    out.close();  }}web xml<locale-encoding-mapping-list>        <locale-encoding-mapping>            <locale>zh_TW</locale>            <encoding>utf-8</encoding>        </locale-encoding-mapping>    </locale-encoding-mapping-list>Output:Hello, world!!@! ???

But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: How to get the current date and time in Java?\n\nPlease using this api: java.util.Calendar.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: java.util.Calendar\n<<<code>>>: Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();\nDate date = calendar.getTime();\nSimpleDateFormat sdf = new SimpleDateFormat(\"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss\");\nString currentDateAndTime = sdf.format(date);\n<<<explanation>>>: The Calendar class in Java provides access to the current date and time. You can get an instance of the Calendar class using the getInstance() method. Then you can use the getTime() method to get the Date object. Finally, you can format the Date object to get the current date and time in the desired format using the SimpleDateFormat class.\n\nPlease using this api: java.util.Date.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: java.util.Date\n<<<code>>>: Date date = new Date();\nSimpleDateFormat sdf = new SimpleDateFormat(\"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss\");\nString currentDateAndTime = sdf.format(date);\n<<<explanation>>>: The Date class in Java provides access to the current date and time. You can get the current date and time by creating a new Date object. Then you can format the Date object to get the current date and time in the desired format using the SimpleDateFormat class.\n\nPlease using this api: java.util.SimpleDateFormat.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: java.util.SimpleDateFormat\n<<<code>>>: SimpleDateFormat sdf = new SimpleDateFormat(\"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss\");\nString currentDateAndTime = sdf.format(date);\n<<<explanation>>>: The SimpleDateFormat class in Java provides methods for formatting and parsing dates. You can specify the desired format when creating a SimpleDateFormat object. Then you can use the format() method to format a Date object into a string in the specified format.\n\nPlease using this api: java.util.TimeZone.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: java.util.TimeZone\n<<<code>>>: TimeZone.setDefault(TimeZone.getTimeZone(\"GMT\"));\n<<<explanation>>>: The TimeZone class in Java provides methods for getting and setting the default time zone. You can use the getTimeZone() method to get a TimeZone object for a specific time zone, and the setDefault() method to set the default time zone. In this case, we are setting the default time zone to GMT.\n\nPlease using this api: java.util.Locale.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: java.util.Locale\n<<<code>>>: Locale locale = new Locale(\"fr\", \"FR\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The Locale class in Java provides methods for getting and setting the default locale. You can use the getDefault() method to get the default locale, and the setDefault() method to set the default locale. In this case, we are setting the default locale to French (fr) in France (FR).\n\nPlease using this api: java.util.ResourceBundle.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: java.util.ResourceBundle\n<<<code>>>: ResourceBundle bundle = ResourceBundle.getBundle(\"MessagesBundle\", locale);\nString message = bundle.getString(\"hello\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The ResourceBundle class in Java provides methods for loading properties files. You can use the getBundle() method to get a ResourceBundle object for a specific properties file and locale. Then you can use the getString() method to get a string from the properties file for a specific key. In this case, we are loading a properties file named \"MessagesBundle\" for a specific locale and getting a string for the key \"hello\".\n\nPlease using this api: java.util.Properties.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: java.util.Properties\n<<<code>>>: Properties properties = new Properties();\nproperties.load(new FileInputStream(\"config.properties\"));\nString value = properties.getProperty(\"key\");\n<<<ex"}
