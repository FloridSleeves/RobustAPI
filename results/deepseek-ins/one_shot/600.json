Here's how you can do it:\n\nArrayList<E> list = ... // your ArrayList\nE lastElement = list.get(list.size() - 1); // get the last element\n\nThis will return the last element in the ArrayList.\n\nAs for returning a result from one class to another, it depends on how you're using these classes. If you're using an Intent to pass data between activities, you can use the startActivityForResult method to get a result back from the second activity.\n\nIf you're using a Fragment, you can override the onActivityResult method in your Fragment to get the result back. Here's an example:\n\n@Override\npublic void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\n    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);\n    // handle the result here\n}\n\nIf you're using a ViewPager, you can get the result by overriding the onActivityResult method in your Fragment that's currently visible to the user.\n\nRemember that the onActivityResult method is called on the Fragment that's currently visible to the user, so you need to make sure that your Fragment is handling the result correctly.\n\nI hope this helps you understand how to get the last value of an ArrayList and how to return a result from one class to another.\n\nA: To get the last value of an ArrayList, you can use the get method with the size of the ArrayList minus 1 as the index.
