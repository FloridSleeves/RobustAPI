The key string \"jgd8f3m8ybjhwlGhr4hihbp0\" is 20 characters long, so you need to pad it with 4 bytes of zeroes. You can use the String.format(\"%-24s\", \"jgd8f3m8ybjhwlGhr4hihbp0\") to get a 24-character string, or manually add the zeroes.\nQuestion: Java 256-bit AES Password-Based Encryption: I need to implement 256 bit AES encryption, but all the examples I have found online use a \"KeyGenerator\" to generate a 256 bit key, but I would like to use my own passkey. How can I create my own key?\nPlease using this api: SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(\"PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256\").\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(\"PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256\")\n<<<code>>>: /* Derive the key, given password and salt. */\nchar[] password = \"myPassword\".toCharArray();\nbyte[] salt = new byte[]{0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05, 0x06, 0x07, 0x08};\nint iterations = 10000;\nint keyLength = 256;\nSecretKeyFactory secretKeyFactory = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(\"PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256\");\nKeySpec keySpec = new PBEKeySpec(password, salt, iterations, keyLength);\nSecretKey secretKey = secretKeyFactory.generateSecret(keySpec);\n<<<explanation>>>: The PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256 algorithm is a password-based key derivation function that produces a derived key of the specified length. The salt and iterations parameters are used to make the key derivation operation slow and computationally expensive, which makes it harder for attackers to guess the key. The keyLength parameter should be set to 256 for a 256-bit key.\n\n\nA: The error you're seeing is not related to AES or TripleDES, but rather to the way you're handling the data.\nWhen you're using PKCS5Padding, the data must be padded to a multiple of the block size. In the case of AES, the block size is 16 bytes. So, if your plaintext is not a multiple of 16 bytes, you'll get an IllegalBlockSizeException.\nYou can use PKCS5Padding with AES, but you need to ensure that your plaintext is a multiple of 16 bytes. If it's not, you can pad it with spaces or other characters until it is.\nHere's an example of how you can pad your plaintext:\nString plaintext = \"Hello, World!\";\nint blockSize = 16;\nint paddingSize = blockSize - (plaintext.length() % blockSize);\nString paddedPlaintext = plaintext + new String(new char[paddingSize]).replace(\"\\0\", \" \");\n\nThis will pad your plaintext with spaces until it's a multiple of 16 bytes.\nThen, you can encrypt the padded plaintext with AES and PKCS5Padding:\nSecretKeySpec secretKeySpec = new"}
