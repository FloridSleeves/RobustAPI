But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nYou should use printWriter.println() instead of printWriter.write(). println() automatically appends a line separator at the end of the string.\nTry this:\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\n\nA: You are using PrintWriter.write() which writes the string as is.
