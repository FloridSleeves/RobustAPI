The length of the message is sent first, followed by a null byte (0), and then the message itself. The null byte is used to indicate the end of the length field and the beginning of the message.\nPlease note that this code assumes that the socket is already connected to the server. If it is not, you will need to establish the connection before calling this method.\n\nA: The problem is likely due to the encoding of the text. The emojis are not being sent as expected because they are not being encoded in a way that the server can understand.\nYou can try to encode the text in UTF-8 before sending it. This will ensure that the emojis are sent correctly. Here is an example of how you can do this:\n```kotlin\nval text = \"Your text with emojis\"\nval encodedText = text.toByteArray(Charset.forName(\"UTF-8\"))\n\n// Then send the encodedText to the server\n```\n\nIn this example, the `toByteArray` method is used to convert the string to a byte array using UTF-8 encoding. This should ensure that the emojis are sent correctly.\n\nAlso, make sure that the server is configured to receive and decode the text in UTF-8. If the server is not configured to do this, it may not be able to correctly interpret the emojis.\n\nIf the problem persists, you may need to check the server-side code to ensure it is correctly handling the received data.\n\nPlease note that the `DataOutputStream.write` method you mentioned is not related to this problem. It's used for writing primitive data types to an output stream.\n\nI hope this helps.
