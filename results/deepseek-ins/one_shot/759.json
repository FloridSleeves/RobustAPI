The PrintWriter buffers the output and only flushes it when it is full or when you explicitly call flush().\nYou can add printWriter.flush(); after printWriter.write(\"1\");, printWriter.write(\"2\");, and printWriter.write(\"3\"); to ensure that the output is immediately written to the socket.\n\nA: You need to flush the PrintWriter after each write. This will ensure that the data is written immediately to the socket.\nHere is the corrected code:\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.flush();\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.flush();\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nprintWriter.flush();\n\nThis will ensure that each character is written immediately to the socket.\n\nA: You should call flush() method after each write. This method forces any buffered output bytes to be written out.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.flush();\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.flush();\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nprintWriter.flush();\n\n\nA: You need to flush the PrintWriter after each write.
