But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Output text to a file with a class method java: :I have a valet class method that should write an hourly wage to a file:public void hourlyOverall() throws FileNotFoundException{    PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(\"wage info\");    new FileOutputStream(\"wage info\", true);    hourlyOverall = tips / hours + hourlyWage;    out.println(hourlyOverall);}However, when I run valet.hourlyOverall() in my main method, the file \"wage info\" is created but nothing is written to it.

You should use the PrintWriter's constructor that takes a FileOutputStream as a parameter.\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java:\n\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"filename.txt\"));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You can use a BufferedReader to read a file line by line. The readLine method returns null when there are no more lines to read.\nQuestion: How to write to a file in Java:\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.println.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.println\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(\"filename.txt\");\npw.println(\"Hello, World!\");\npw.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: You can use a PrintWriter to write to a file. The println method writes a line to the file and automatically adds a newline character.\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java:\n\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"filename.txt\"));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You can use a BufferedReader to read a file line by line.

The PrintWriter buffers the output and doesn't actually write it to the file until you call flush().\nSo, you should change your code to:\nPrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(\"filename.txt\"));\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nprintWriter.flush(); // This will write the buffer to the file\nprintWriter.close(); // This will also flush the buffer and close the PrintWriter\n\nAnd for reading the file:\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"filename.txt\"));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nbufferedReader.close();\n\nThis should solve your problem.\n\nA: You need to flush the PrintWriter after writing to it.
