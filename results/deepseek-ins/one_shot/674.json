But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Where compiled code will be stored if not in class file: :Recently I came across a query while reading THE STRUCTURE OF THE JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINEOn page no-5 ch. 2,Compiled code to be executed by the Java Virtual Machine is  represented using a hardware- and operating system-independent binary  format, typically (but not necessarily) stored in a file, known as the  class file format.That bracket But not necessarily is the reason.Question is, In which case compiled code will not be stored in class file ? and if it will not be stored in class file, then where and how ?Edit : Please note that question is not about ClassLoader.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem.

This tells the BufferedReader to consider the line as complete.\nQuestion: How to get the current time in milliseconds in Java:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: System.currentTimeMillis()\n<<<code>>>: long currentTimeMillis = System.currentTimeMillis();\n<<<explanation>>>: System.currentTimeMillis() returns the current time in milliseconds from the Epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00.000 GMT).\nQuestion: How to create a new thread in Java:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Thread\n<<<code>>>: new Thread(new Runnable() {\n    public void run() {\n        // Your code here\n    }\n}).start();\n<<<explanation>>>: In Java, you can create a new thread by creating a new instance of the Thread class and passing a Runnable to its constructor. The Runnable's run method contains the code that will be executed in the new thread. The start method is then called to start the thread.\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.readAllLines\n<<<code>>>: List<String> lines = Files.readAllLines(Paths.get(\"path/to/file\"));\n<<<explanation>>>: The Files.readAllLines method reads all lines from a file and returns them as a List of Strings. The Paths.get method is used to get a Path object representing the file.\nQuestion: How to write to a file in Java:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.write\n<<<code>>>: Files.write(Paths.get(\"path/to/file\"), Collections.singleton(\"Hello, World!\"), StandardOpenOption.CREATE, StandardOpenOption.TRUNCATE_EXISTING);\n<<<explanation>>>: The Files.write method writes data to a file. The Paths.get method is used to get a Path object representing the file. The Collections.singleton method is used to create a List containing a single line of text. The StandardOpenOption.CREATE and StandardOpenOption.TRUNCATE_EXISTING options are used to ensure that the file is created (if it doesn't exist) and that it is truncated (if it does exist).\n\n\nA: You are writing the lines without a line separator.
