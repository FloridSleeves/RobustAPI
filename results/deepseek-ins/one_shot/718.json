But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Does a PrintWriter / PrintStream need to be flushed?: :I'd like to use a PrintWriter or PrintStream to write formatted strings out to an outputstream (for which I have no control over the creation).  However flushing the underlying OutputStream has a big performance hit.Does a PrintWriter / PrintStream need to be flushed.If I need to flush the PrintStream / PrintWriter; can I do so without flushing the underlying OutputStream, or will I need to create a \"flush protecter\" OutputStream to wrap the underlying stream?To try to be a little clearer on this I want to implement public void writeSomeString(OutputStream foo);But this method may be called many times for the same OutputStream (foo).  Each call will have to construct its own PrintWriter.  I know it's ugly to do so but I have no control over the interface or the creation of foo.I'm trying to avoid each method having to flush foo just to flush its own PrintWriter / PrintStream.So I want to:public void writeSomeString(OutputStream foo) {    PrintStream s = new PrintStream(foo);    s.println(\"bar\");    // other code}I want to completely avoid this method flushing foo \nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem.

If you don't flush, the data may not be written to the stream until the stream is closed.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem.

It returns null if the stream ends. In your case, you are only reading one line, so the remaining data in the stream is not read.

The BufferedReader.readLine() method reads until it encounters a newline character, so it's reading the entire stream as one line.\nYou should add newline characters after each write:\nprintWriter.write(\"1\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\\n\");\n\nOr, if you want to send multiple lines without newlines, you can use println() instead of write():\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\nThen, when you read the lines, you should use readLine() in a loop until it returns null:\nString line;\nwhile ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n\nThis will read each line separately.\n\nA: The problem is that you are not sending newline characters (\\n or \\r\\n) between your lines.
