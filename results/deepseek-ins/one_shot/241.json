It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Println the return values of an executable: :I have deploy an matlab .m file into an windows console application.

How can I do this in Android? I've tried using a BufferedInputStream but it doesn't seem to work. Here is my current code:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedInputStream\n<<<code>>>: BufferedInputStream bis = new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(file), 1024 * 1024);\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1024 * 1024];\nint bytesRead;\nwhile ((bytesRead = bis.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n    // process buffer\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You can use a BufferedInputStream to read a file in chunks. The second argument to the BufferedInputStream constructor is the buffer size, which you can set to 1mb (1024 * 1024 bytes). The read method will return the number of bytes read, which you can use to process the buffer.\n\nA: The problem with your code is that you are reading one byte at a time, which is very inefficient. You should use the read(byte[] b) method of InputStream, which reads bytes into an array and returns the number of bytes read.\n\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: \nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\nint bytesRead;\nwhile ((bytesRead = is.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n    // process buffer\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The read(byte[] b) method reads bytes into the specified byte array and returns the number of bytes read. This is more efficient than reading one byte at a time.\n\nFor your second question, you can use a BufferedInputStream to read the file in chunks. Here is how you can do it:\n\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedInputStream\n<<<code>>>: \nBufferedInputStream bis = new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(file), 1024 * 1024);\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1024 * 1024];\nint bytesRead;\nwhile ((bytesRead = bis.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n    // process buffer\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The BufferedInputStream buffers the input data, so you can read it in chunks.

Here is how you can do it:\n\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader\n<<<code>>>: \nBufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(process.getInputStream()));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The BufferedReader buffers the input data, so you can read it line by line.

Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\nA: You can use the BufferedInputStream to read the file in chunks. Here is an example:\n\n```java\nBufferedInputStream bis = new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(file), 1024 * 1024);\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1024 * 1024];\nint bytesRead;\nwhile ((bytesRead = bis.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n    // process buffer\n}\n```\n\nThis code creates a BufferedInputStream that"}
