But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Write String to a text file: :I have this code that gets GPS data from input stream make the test file but there is nothing inside.

This will overwrite the previous data in the file. You should create the PrintWriter only once and reuse it.\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.readAllLines\n<<<code>>>: List<String> lines = Files.readAllLines(Paths.get(\"file.txt\"));\n<<<explanation>>>: The Files.readAllLines method reads all lines from a file and returns them as a List of Strings. This is a more efficient way to read a file in Java 8 and later.\nQuestion: How to write a file in Java:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.write\n<<<code>>>: Files.write(Paths.get(\"file.txt\"), Collections.singleton(\"Hello, World!\"), StandardOpenOption.CREATE, StandardOpenOption.TRUNCATE_EXISTING);\n<<<explanation>>>: The Files.write method writes data to a file. The StandardOpenOption.CREATE option will create the file if it does not exist, and the StandardOpenOption.TRUNCATE_EXISTING option will truncate the file to zero length if it exists.\nQuestion: How to read a file line by line in Java:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.lines\n<<<code>>>: Files.lines(Paths.get(\"file.txt\")).forEach(System.out::println);\n<<<explanation>>>: The Files.lines method reads all lines from a file and returns them as a Stream of Strings. This allows you to process each line individually.\nQuestion: How to write a file line by line in Java:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.write\n<<<code>>>: List<String> lines = Arrays.asList(\"line1\", \"line2\", \"line3\");\nFiles.write(Paths.get(\"file.txt\"), lines, StandardOpenOption.CREATE, StandardOpenOption.TRUNCATE_EXISTING);\n<<<explanation>>>: The Files.write method can also be used to write a list of strings to a file. Each string will be written as a separate line. The StandardOpenOption.CREATE option will create the file if it does not exist, and the StandardOpenOption.TRUNCATE_EXISTING option will truncate the file to zero length if it exists.\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"file.txt\"));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\nreader.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The BufferedReader.readLine method reads a line of text from the file. It returns null when there are no more lines to read. This is a common way to read a file line by line in Java.\nQuestion: How to write a file in Java:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.println\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"file.txt\", \"UTF-8\");\nwriter.println(\"Hello, World!\");\nwriter.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The PrintWriter.println method writes a line of text to the file. This is a common way to write a file in Java. The second argument to the PrintWriter constructor is the character set to use, which in this case is \"UTF-8\".\nQuestion: How to read a file line by line in Java:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"file.txt\"));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\nreader.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The BufferedReader.readLine method reads a line of text from the file. It returns null when there are no more lines to read. This is a common way to read a file line by line in Java.\nQuestion: How to write a file line by"}
