But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: How to write console output to a txt file: :I have tried to write the console output to a txt file using this code suggestion (http://www.daniweb.com/forums/thread23883.html#) however I was not successful.

You need to call flush() method to ensure that the data is written to the file.\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\ntry {\n    FileReader fileReader = new FileReader(\"file.txt\");\n    BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(fileReader);\n\n    String line;\n    while((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) {\n        System.out.println(line);\n    }\n    bufferedReader.close();\n} catch(IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: The BufferedReader reads text from a character-input stream, buffering characters so as to provide for the efficient reading of characters, arrays, and lines. It makes the performance fast. It can be used to read character files and also to read from InputStreams.\nQuestion: How to write to a file in Java:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\ntry {\n    PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(\"file.txt\"));\n    printWriter.println(\"Hello, World!\");\n    printWriter.close();\n} catch(IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: The PrintWriter class is used to print formatted representations of objects to a text-output stream. It is designed to provide more efficient output for text-based applications than the standard OutputStream write methods. It can be used to write character files and also to write to OutputStreams.\nQuestion: How to read a file line by line in Java:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\ntry {\n    FileReader fileReader = new FileReader(\"file.txt\");\n    BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(fileReader);\n\n    String line;\n    while((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) {\n        System.out.println(line);\n    }\n    bufferedReader.close();\n} catch(IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: The BufferedReader reads text from a character-input stream, buffering characters so as to provide for the efficient reading of characters, arrays, and lines.

It is designed to provide more efficient output for text-based applications than the standard OutputStream write methods. It can be used to write character files and also to write to OutputStreams. The second parameter of FileWriter is a boolean that determines whether to append to the file or not.\n\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: try { System.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine()); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The readLine() method reads a line of text. A line is considered to be terminated by any one of a line feed ('\\n'), a carriage return ('\\r'), or a carriage return followed immediately by a line feed.\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\ntry {\n    FileReader fileReader = new FileReader(\"file.txt\");\n    BufferedReader bufferedReader ="}
