It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block.

What can I do?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: InputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n<<<explanation>>>: You are already calling getInputStream() before the while loop. So it should not return null. If it does, you might want to check if the socket is closed or if there was an error during the connection.\n\n\nA: You are reading one byte at a time, which is very inefficient. You should read the whole buffer at once.\nYou can use the read(byte[] b) method of InputStream, which reads some number of bytes from the input stream and stores them into the buffer array b.\nHere is an example:\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint bytesRead = is.read(buffer);\n\nIn this case, bytesRead will contain the number of bytes read. If you want to read exactly 3 bytes, you can do:\nbyte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\nint bytesRead = is.read(lengthBuffer);\nif (bytesRead != 3) {\n    // handle error\n}\nint length = lengthBuffer[0] | lengthBuffer[1] << 8 | lengthBuffer[2] << 16;\n\nbyte[] dataBuffer = new byte[length];\nbytesRead = is.read(dataBuffer);\nif (bytesRead != length) {\n    // handle error\n}\n\nThis way, you read the whole buffer at once, which is much more efficient.\nAlso, you should check if the read method returns -1 when there is no more data to read. This indicates that the end of the stream has been reached.\nint b = is.read();\nif (b == -1) {\n    // handle end of stream\n}\n\n\nA: You can use the read(byte[] b) method of InputStream which reads up to b.length bytes of data from the input stream and stores them into the buffer array b.\nHere is an example:\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint bytesRead = is.read(buffer);\n\nIn this case, bytesRead will contain the number of bytes read. If you want to read exactly 3 bytes, you can do:\nbyte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\nint bytesRead = is.read(lengthBuffer);\nif (bytesRead != 3) {\n    // handle error\n}\nint length = lengthBuffer[0] | lengthBuffer[1] << 8 | lengthBuffer[2] << 16;\n\nbyte[] dataBuffer = new byte[length];\nbytesRead = is.read(dataBuffer);\nif (bytesRead != length) {\n    // handle error\n}\n\nThis way, you read the whole buffer at once, which is much more efficient.\nAlso, you should check if the read method returns -1 when there is no more data to read.
