I wrote objects at various locations in the file. The objects were of variable sizes but all of the same class.Now I want to read from such a file. I dont want to have to specify the number of bytes to read. I want to be able to read the object directly using Object Input Stream. How to achieve this ? I have to use Random Access Files because I need to write to different positions in file. I am also recording in a separate data structure, the locations where objects have been written.\nPlease using this api: FileChannel.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileChannel.write\n<<<code>>>: while(rbb.hasRemaining()) {\n        try{\n            fileChannel.writeLong(recordBytes.length);\n            fileChannel.write(rbb);\n        } catch {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");}\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The simplest solution that comes to mind is to write out the length of the array before writing out the array itself. When reading the object, you first read the length. This'll tell you how many further bytes to read to get your object. Similarly to what you are already doing on the writing side, you could read the data into a byte[] and then use ByteArrayInputputStream and ObjectInputStream.\nQuestion: Read/Write using FileChannel and FileInput/OutputStream-Java: :I am new to file handling.

This is not efficient and will result in a new file being created for each write operation. Instead, you should create the FileChannel once and then use it for all write operations. Also, you need to flip the buffer before writing it and clear it after writing it.\n\nPlease note that the above code assumes that you want to copy the content of the file \"sss.jpg\" to \"sss1.jpg\". If you want to append the content of \"sss.jpg\" to \"sss1.jpg\", you should use `FileOutputStream(new File(\"sss1.jpg\"), true)` instead of `FileOutputStream(\"sss1.jpg\")`.\n\nAlso, remember to close your FileChannels after you're done with them to free up system resources. You can do this by calling `inChannel.close()` and `outChannel.close()`.\n\nLastly, always handle exceptions properly in your code. The current code does not handle any exceptions that might occur during file operations.\n\nHere is the corrected code:\n\n```java\npublic class FileTest {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        try {\n            File file = new File(\"sss.jpg\");\n            FileChannel inChannel = new FileInputStream(file).getChannel();\n            FileChannel outChannel = new FileOutputStream(\"sss1.jpg\").getChannel();\n            ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024);\n            while (inChannel.read(buffer) > 0) {\n                buffer.flip();\n                outChannel.write(buffer);\n                buffer.clear();\n            }\n            inChannel.close();\n            outChannel.close();\n        } catch (IOException ex) {\n            ex.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code will copy the content of \"sss.jpg\" to \"sss1.jpg\". If you want to append the content of \"sss.jpg\" to \"sss1.jpg\", you should use `FileOutputStream(new File(\"sss1.jpg\"), true)` instead of `FileOutputStream(\"sss1.jpg\")`.\n\nAlso, remember to close your FileChannels after you're done with them to free up system resources. You can do this by calling `inChannel.close()` and `outChannel.close()`.\n\nLastly, always handle exceptions properly in your code.
