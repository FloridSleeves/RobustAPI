The cost increases dramatically by using \"rwd\" instead of \"rw\" which should be enough to indicate its not the calls themselves which cost the time. (its the fact the OS is try to commit every write to disk and the disk only spins so fast)\nQuestion: How to append to AES encrypted file: :I'm writing some kind of logger that produces encrypted log-file. Unfortunately, cryptography is not my strong side. Now I can write to file several messages and then close file. Then i can open it, append some messages, close again and after decryption I see padding bytes in the middle of file. Is there any way to work with encrypted file without having to decrypt it every time I want to append some messages?EDIT: little more details. Current implementation utlizes CipherOutputStream. As i understand there's no way to seek using it.Can i use 'NoPadding' option if i will control that output data size is divisible by block size?\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Why is RandomAccessFile writeLong implemented with multiple write calls?: While profiling an application I noticed that RandomAccessFile.writeLong was taking a lot of time.\n\nI checked the code for this method, and it involves eight calls of the native method write.

As i understand there's no way to seek using it.Can i use 'NoPadding' option if i will control that output data size is divisible by block size?\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.write.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: CipherOutputStream\n<<<code>>>: \n```\nKeyGenerator keyGenerator = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");\nkeyGenerator.init(128);\nSecretKey secretKey = keyGenerator.generateKey();\n\nCipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES\");\ncipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secretKey);\n\nFileOutputStream fileOut = new FileOutputStream(\"encrypted.dat\");\nCipherOutputStream cipherOut = new CipherOutputStream(fileOut, cipher);\n\nRandomAccessFile raf = new RandomAccessFile(\"encrypted.dat\", \"rw\");\nraf.seek(raf.length());\n\ncipherOut.write(\"Hello, World!\".getBytes());\ncipherOut.close();\nraf.close();\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: You can use CipherOutputStream to write encrypted data to a file. The data is encrypted as it is written, so you don't need to decrypt the entire file to append to it. However, you can't seek within the CipherOutputStream. If you need to append data, you'll have to write it at the end of the file. If you need to write at a specific position, you'll have to read the existing data, write the new data, and then write the existing data back. This can be inefficient if the file is large.\n\nIf you want to avoid decrypting the entire file, you can use a different approach. Instead of writing the encrypted data to a file, write it to a temporary file. When you're done writing, rename the temporary file to the original file name. This will atomically replace the original file with the new data.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```java\nKeyGenerator keyGenerator = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");\nkeyGenerator.init(128);\nSecretKey secretKey = keyGenerator.generateKey();\n\nCipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES\");\ncipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secretKey);\n\nFileOutputStream fileOut = new FileOutputStream(\"encrypted.dat\");\nCipherOutputStream cipherOut = new CipherOutputStream(fileOut, cipher);\n\ncipherOut.write(\"Hello, World!\".getBytes());\ncipherOut.close();\n\nFile tempFile = File.createTempFile(\"encrypted\", \".dat\");\nFiles.copy(new FileInputStream(\"encrypted.dat\"), new FileOutputStream(tempFile));\ntempFile.renameTo(new File(\"encrypted.dat\"));\n```\n\nThis approach will not leave padding bytes in the middle of the file.\n\nPlease note that this approach will not work if you need to read the encrypted data. You'll need to decrypt it again when you read it. If you need to read the data, you'll need to decrypt it.\n\nAlso, this approach will not work if you need to write to the file while it's being read. You'll need to wait until you've finished reading before you can write to the file.\n\nIf you need to write to the file while it's being read, you'll need to use a different approach. For example, you could write the data to a temporary file and then rename it to the original file name. This will atomically replace the original file with the new data.\n\nPlease note that this approach will not leave padding bytes in the middle of the file. If you need to control the output data size is divisible by block size, you can use \"NoPadding\" option.\n\nPlease note that this approach will not work if you need to read the encrypted data.
