But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: print value on netbeans log file: :I tried with different ways to print value on Log File of Netbenas6.9.1 . I am using Tomcat6.0 .

If you want to print the values on the log file of NetBeans, you need to redirect the System.out.println to the log file.\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine().\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine()\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"your_file.txt\"));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The BufferedReader.readLine() method reads a line of text.
