It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: reading c# binary files in java: :I have a program in C# .net which writes 1 integer and 3 strings to a file, using BinaryWriter.Write().

You need to interpret those bytes as the original data types (int, String). The DataInputStream.readInt() and DataInputStream.readUTF() methods do exactly that. They read the length of the string first, then the string itself.\nQuestion: How to convert byte array to hexadecimal string in java: :I have a byte array, I want to convert it to a hexadecimal string. How can I do this?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Integer.toHexString\n<<<code>>>: byte[] bytes = ...; // your byte array\nStringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(bytes.length * 2);\nfor(byte b : bytes) {\n    sb.append(String.format(\"%02x\", b & 0xff));\n}\nString hexString = sb.toString();\n<<<explanation>>>: You can use the Integer.toHexString method to convert each byte to a hexadecimal string. But since it returns a string with a leading \"0x\", you need to use String.format to format the string to have two digits, and to mask the byte with 0xff to ensure it's a positive number.\n\n\nA: You can use the following code to convert a byte array to a hexadecimal string:\nbyte[] bytes = ...; // your byte array\nStringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(bytes.length * 2);\nfor(byte b : bytes) {\n    sb.append(String.format(\"%02x\", b & 0xff));\n}\nString hexString = sb.toString();\n\nThis code creates a StringBuilder, then iterates over each byte in the byte array, formats it as a hexadecimal string, and appends it to the StringBuilder. The resulting hexadecimal string is then obtained by calling toString() on the StringBuilder.\n\nA: You can use the following code to convert a byte array to a hexadecimal string:\nbyte[] bytes = ...; // your byte array\nStringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(bytes.length * 2);\nfor(byte b : bytes) {\n    sb.append(String.format(\"%02x\", b & 0xff));\n}\nString hexString = sb.toString();\n\nThis code creates a StringBuilder, then iterates over each byte in the byte array, formats it as a hexadecimal string, and appends it to the StringBuilder.
