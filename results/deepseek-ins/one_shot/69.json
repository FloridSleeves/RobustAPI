The problem is that Cipher.update() doesn't return the encrypted block until it has a full 16-byte block because CTR is basically based on a block cipher though simulating a stream cipher. I should read data from a tcp socket and process messages as soon as they arrive, but I can't retrieve the most recent block because it's still building up and its size is less than 16 bytes. And I can't just wait because we don't know when the next message would be sent. Of course I could call Cipher.doFinal() to get the leftover but that would mean the end of the stream (connection) and the Cipher object would be reinitialized.I thought it would be nice if there's a way to peek the carryover. CTR simply XORs the plain text with the keystream so I should be able to get the encrypted data regardless of the rest of the bytes in the block. Would there be a nice workaround to this problem? I'm thinking about writing a wrapper that encrypts fake plain text with zeroes to get the keystream in advance and XORs manually, but I wonder how other people solved this problem.UpdateI'm developing an Android application and it turned out that this is the problem of the Dalvik VM. As Robert and monnand pointed out below, Java SE doesn't have this problem at least with the default provider. I think I'll have to write a wrapper class or change the mode to CFB8 to get around this problem.

However, it does not provide padding, so you need to ensure that the data you're encrypting is a multiple of 16 bytes long. You can use NoPadding to avoid this problem.\nQuestion: Java 256-bit AES Password-Based Encryption: I need to implement 256 bit AES encryption, but all the examples I have found online use a \"KeyGenerator\" to generate a 256 bit key, but I would like to use my own passkey. How can I create my own key?\nPlease using this api: SecretKeyFactory.getInstance.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(\"PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256\")\n<<<code>>>: /* Derive the key, given password and salt. */\nSecretKeyFactory factory = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(\"PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256\");\nKeySpec spec = new PBEKeySpec(password, salt, 65536, 256);\nSecretKey tmp = factory.generateSecret(spec);\nSecretKey secret = new SecretKeySpec(tmp.getEncoded(), \"AES\");\n<<<explanation>>>: PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) with HMAC-SHA256 is a standard for generating a 256-bit key from a password and a salt. The number 65536 is the iteration count, which determines how long the key derivation takes. The higher the iteration count, the longer the key derivation takes, but it also makes the key derivation more secure.\n\n\nA: \nI need to implement 256 bit AES encryption, but all the examples I have found online use a \"KeyGenerator\" to generate a 256 bit key, but I would like to use my own passkey. How can I create my own key?\n\nYou can use the PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) with HMAC-SHA256 algorithm to generate a 256-bit key from a password and a salt. Here is an example:\n\n```java\nimport javax.crypto.SecretKeyFactory;\nimport javax.crypto.spec.PBEKeySpec;\nimport java.security.spec.KeySpec;\nimport java.security.spec.SecretKeySpec;\nimport java.security.SecureRandom;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\n        // Password\n        char[] password = \"myPassword\".toCharArray();\n\n        // Salt\n        byte[] salt = new byte[16];\n        new SecureRandom().nextBytes(salt);\n\n        // Derive the key\n        SecretKeyFactory factory = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(\"PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256\");\n        KeySpec spec = new PBEKeySpec(password, salt, 65536, 256);\n        SecretKeySpec secretKey = new SecretKeySpec(factory.generateSecret(spec).getEncoded(), \"AES\");\n\n        // Print the key\n        System.out.println(new String(secretKey.getEncoded()));\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `PBEKeySpec` constructor takes the password, salt, iteration count, and key length. The iteration count is a measure of how long the key derivation takes, and the higher the iteration count"}
