It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block.

You should read the entire buffer at once, and then process the data.\nHere's a modified version of your code that should improve performance:\nclient = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(10485"}
