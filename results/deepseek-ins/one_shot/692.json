For reading a file I know you can use Scanner and read it and then print it. However reading a file and then printing it in a new format, like double space, indents, basically any spacing issues, is that also considered reading it or is it writing it? From my understanding of what my teacher has taught me, is that writing overwrites the original document and replaces it. Also how does one use the PrintWriter command? I have never seen this before in my class nor have read about it in my textbook but its on my test according to my teacher. Could someone give an explanation and an example about it? I read this site http://www.caveofprogramming.com/frontpage/articles/java/java-file-reading-and-writing-files-in-java/ on writing files, but it uses FileWriter, which I'm assuming takes the place of scanner?

But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\n\nA: The problem is that you are writing strings without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters (like \"\\n\", \"\\r\", \"\\r\\n\") which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\n\nTo fix this, you should write a line break character (\"\\n\") after each string:\nprintWriter.write(\"1\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\\n\");\n\nThen, when you read the lines, you should use bufferedReader.readLine() in a loop until it returns null, which indicates the end of the stream:\nString line;\nwhile ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n\n\nAs for your second question, reading a file and then printing it in a new format is indeed reading the file. When you read a file, you are getting its content. Then, you can manipulate that content (like adding spaces, indents, etc.) and print it out.\n\nAs for PrintWriter, it is used for writing to a character-output stream. It provides methods to write characters, strings, and formatted data. Here is an example of how to use it:\n\n```java\nPrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(\"output.txt\");\nprintWriter.println(\"Hello, world!\");\nprintWriter.println(\"This is a new line.\");\nprintWriter.println(\"Another line.\");\nprintWriter.close();\n```\n\nIn this example, the strings \"Hello, world!\" and \"This is a new line.\" are written to the file \"output.txt\". The close() method is used to ensure that all data is written to the file and the stream is closed.\n\nAs you mentioned, you can use FileWriter instead of PrintWriter if you want to write to a file. The FileWriter class is a convenience class for writing character files, and it extends the Writer class. Here is an example:\n\n```java\ntry (FileWriter fileWriter = new FileWriter(\"output.txt\")) {\n    fileWriter.write(\"Hello, world!\");\n    fileWriter.write(\"\\nThis is a new line.\");\n    fileWriter.write(\"\\nAnother line.\");\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the FileWriter object is used to write to the file \"output.txt\". The write() method is used to write strings to the file. The try-with-resources statement is used to automatically close the FileWriter when it is no longer needed.\n\nIn both examples, the strings are written to the file, but the way they are written is controlled by the PrintWriter and FileWriter classes, respectively.\n\nI hope this helps clarify these concepts for you. Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\n\nA: The issue is that you are writing strings without a line break.
