It ignores lines that start with '#' (comments) and empty lines. It splits each line into a key and a value using '=' as the delimiter. The key and value are then added to a HashMap. The HashMap is returned at the end.\n\n\nA: You can use Scanner class in Java which can read inputs from the console until the user enters \"exit\". Here is the code:\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n        String line;\n        while (true) {\n            line = scanner.nextLine();\n            if (\"exit\".equals(line)) {\n                break;\n            }\n            System.out.println(\"You entered: \" + line);\n        }\n        scanner.close();\n    }\n}\n\nIn this code, the program will keep reading lines from the console until the user enters \"exit\". After that, the program will break the loop and exit.\n\nA: You can use the Scanner class in Java to read lines from the console. The Scanner class has a nextLine() method that reads a line of text. You can use a while loop to keep reading lines until the user enters \"exit\". Here is a simple example:\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n        String line;\n        while (true) {\n            line = scanner.nextLine();\n            if (\"exit\".equals(line)) {\n                break;\n            }\n            System.out.println(\"You entered: \" + line);\n        }\n        scanner.close();\n    }\n}\n\nIn this code, the program will keep reading lines from the console until the user enters \"exit\".
