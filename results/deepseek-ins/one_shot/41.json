I am confused how does it work? why doesn't it give error just like we get in java code? and most importantly, how does environment decide to which component it needs to invoke? I understand the process of id generation is automated, which gets added to R.java For instance, if we have same IDs, say \"image1\" in two XMLs, say \"layout1\" & \"layout2\". but in R.java it won't have 2 IDs. that means at a time it will reference only 1 component. In case we have to use 2 XMLs in an Activity, one as activity.setcontentview(layout1) and another as a PopupWindow.setContentView(layout2). What will happen in such case?\n\nAnswer: The Android system automatically generates unique IDs for each view in your layout files. When you set a layout using setContentView(), the system parses the XML file and generates the corresponding View objects, each with a unique ID. This ID is used to reference the view in your code.\n\nIf you have the same IDs in different layout files, the system will use the ID from the last layout file set with setContentView(). This is because the IDs are not unique across different layout files.\n\nIn your case, if you have the same IDs in two different layout files, say \"image1\" in \"layout1\" and \"layout2\", the system will use the ID from \"layout2\" when you set the content view to \"layout2\". The IDs in \"layout1\" will not be accessible.\n\nIf you want to use the same IDs in different layouts, you should assign unique IDs to each view in your layout files. For example, you could assign different IDs to the same view in \"layout1\" and \"layout2\".\n\nQuestion: App is crashing before it starts: :I'm creating a simple app with two NumberPickers used to select a certain number of minutes and seconds. There isn't too much code so I will post it here:\n\nAnswer: The crash is likely due to the fact that you're trying to access the NumberPickers before they've been initialized. In your onCreate() method, you're trying to access numberPicker1 and numberPicker2 before they've been set to the views in your layout.\n\nYou should move the initialization of numberPicker1 and numberPicker2 to the onCreate() method, after you've called setContentView() and before you're trying to access them. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```java\n@Override\nprotected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n\n    numberPicker1 = (NumberPicker) findViewById(R.id.numberPicker"}
