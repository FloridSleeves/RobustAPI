But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: How do i Dump contents of Vector into a new file?: :Here is my program to calculate prime numbers that are before 92.

First, create a new FileReader with the name of the file you want to read. Then, create a new BufferedReader with the FileReader as the parameter. You can read lines from the file with the readLine method. This method returns null when there are no more lines to read. You should check for this condition in your while loop. Finally, don't forget to close the BufferedReader when you're done.\n\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"filename.txt\"));\n<<<explanation>>>: You can use a BufferedReader to read from a file.

The constructors of this class assume that the default character encoding and the default byte-buffer size are acceptable.\n\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.close.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.close\n<<<code>>>: bufferedReader.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The close method closes the stream and releases any system resources associated with it. Once the stream has been closed, further read() or readLine() calls will throw an IOException.\n\nPlease using this api: IOException.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: IOException\n<<<code>>>: catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: IOException is a checked exception that can occur while working with files. It is thrown when an input or output operation fails or is interrupted. The printStackTrace method is used to print the stack trace of this exception to the standard error stream.\n\nPlease using this api: FileNotFoundException.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileNotFoundException\n<<<code>>>: catch (FileNotFoundException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: FileNotFoundException is a subclass of IOException. It is thrown when an attempt is made to open a connection to a file on an file system that does not exist. The printStackTrace method is used to print the stack trace of this exception to the standard error stream.\n\nPlease using this api: File.separator.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: File.separator\n<<<code>>>: String filePath = \"folder\" + File.separator + \"file.txt\";\n<<<explanation>>>: The File.separator field is a string containing"}
