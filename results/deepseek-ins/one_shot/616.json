Here's an example:\nMap<String, int[][]> map = new HashMap<>();\nmap.put(\"array1\", new int[][] {{1,2,3}, {4,5,6}});\nmap.put(\"array2\", new int[][] {{7,8,9}, {10,11,12}});\n\nThen you can get the 2D array by its name:\nint[][] arrayToBeInvokedWith = map.get(\"array1\");\n\nNow you can pass arrayToBeInvokedWith to your method:\nmethod(arrayToBeInvokedWith);\n\nThis way, you can store any number of 2D arrays in the map and access them by their names.\n\nA: You can use a Map of Maps to store your 2D arrays.
