The println method is used to write a string and then terminate the line.\n\nA: The problem is that you are writing each line of text as a separate call to PrintWriter.write(). The PrintWriter.write() method does not automatically add a newline character at the end of the string you pass to it.\nInstead, you should use PrintWriter.println() which automatically adds a newline character.\nSo, instead of:\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\n\nYou should use:\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\nThis will ensure that each line of text is written to the file on a new line.\n\nA: The problem is that you are not writing a newline character after each write. The BufferedReader.readLine() method reads until it encounters a newline character. If you don't write a newline character after each write, the BufferedReader.readLine() method will not see it as the end of a line, and will continue to read from the socket.\nYou should use PrintWriter.println() instead of PrintWriter.write(). println() automatically appends a newline character to the end of the string it is given.\nSo, instead of:\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\n\nYou should use:\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\n\nA: You are not writing newline character after each write.
