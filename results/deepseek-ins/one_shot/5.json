This way, you can use the MenuActivity instance in the SearchView class.\n\nA: You can use Handler and postDelayed method to pause your thread.\nHere is an example:\nnew Handler().postDelayed(new Runnable() {\n    @Override\n    public void run() {\n        // your code here\n    }\n}, 1000);\n\nIn this example, the code inside the run method will be executed after 1 second (1000 milliseconds).\n\nA: You can use the postDelayed method of the Handler class to delay the execution of a Runnable.\nHere is an example:\nnew Handler().postDelayed(new Runnable() {\n    @Override\n    public void run() {\n        // your code here\n    }\n}, 1000);\n\nIn this example, the code inside the run method will be executed after 1 second (1000 milliseconds).\n\nA: You can use the postDelayed method of the Handler class to delay the execution of a Runnable.
