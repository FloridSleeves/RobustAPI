It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\n\nA: You are writing to the PrintWriter without a newline character. This is causing the BufferedReader to read the entire stream as a single line.\nYou should write a newline character after each line you want to send. Here is how you can do it:\nprintWriter.write(\"1\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\\n\");\n\nThis will send three separate lines to the server, which should allow you to read them separately with bufferedReader.readLine().\n\nA: You can use the println() method of PrintWriter to send each line separately. This method automatically appends a line separator at the end of the line.\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\nThen you can read each line separately using bufferedReader.readLine()\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\n\nThis should give you the output \"1\", \"2\", and \"3\" separately.\n\nA: You can use the println() method of PrintWriter to send each line separately.
