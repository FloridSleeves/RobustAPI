But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\n\nA: The problem is that you're using PrintWriter.write() which writes the string as is to the underlying output stream. It doesn't automatically add a newline character.\nYou should use PrintWriter.println() instead, which writes a line terminator after the string.\nSo, instead of:\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\n\nYou should use:\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\nThis will ensure that each of your printWriter.println() calls will write a newline character after the string, which should allow you to read each line separately with bufferedReader.readLine().\n\nA: The problem is that you're writing the strings without a newline character. The BufferedReader.readLine() method reads a line from the stream, stopping at a newline character. When you use write() without a newline, it doesn't stop reading until the stream ends.\nYou should use println() or print() instead of write() to write the strings with a newline character.\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\nOr\nprintWriter.print(\"1\");\nprintWriter.print(\"2\");\nprintWriter.print(\"3\");\nprintWriter.println(); // This will add a newline character.\n\n\nA: You are using PrintWriter.write() which writes the string as is to the underlying output stream.
