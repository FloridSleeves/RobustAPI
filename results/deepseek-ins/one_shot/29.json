You cannot have same id for the view's in the same view tree. (must be unique).\n\nA: \nwhy doesn't it give error just like we get in java code?\n\nThe reason is that the Android system is designed to handle multiple views with the same ID in a single layout file. When you call findViewById(), the system searches the current view hierarchy for a view with the given ID. If it finds one, it returns that view. If it doesn't find one, it returns null.\n\nhow does environment decide to which component it needs to invoke?\n\nThe environment doesn't decide which component to invoke. It's the developer who decides which view to find using findViewById(). The developer specifies the ID of the view they want to find.\n\nwhat will happen in such case?\n\nIf you call setContentView() with layout1 and then call setContentView() with layout2, the system will replace the current view hierarchy with the new layout. This means that findViewById() will only search the new view hierarchy, not the old one. Therefore, if you call findViewById() after calling setContentView() with layout2, it will not find the views that were in layout1.\n\nI THINK I've found my problem. In my background thread I am using a parse.com method \"query.findInBackground\" which I assume is starting a third thread? I'm trying to update this to \"query.find\" and I'm hoping that will fix.\n\nYes, you're correct. The findInBackground() method runs the query in a background thread, which means it won't block the UI thread. This is important because if you were to run the query on the UI thread, your app would freeze until the query is complete.\n\nI'm hoping that will fix.\n\nYes, it should fix your problem. The find() method runs the query on the UI thread, which means it will block the UI thread until the query is complete. This is why it's generally a good idea to use findInBackground() for network requests or other long-running operations.\n\nA: \nwhy doesn't it give error just like we get in java code?\n\nBecause Android's findViewById() method can find views with the same ID in different layouts. It's not an error, but rather a way to handle situations where you might have multiple views with the same ID in your layout.\n\nhow does environment decide to which component it needs to invoke?\n\nThe environment doesn't decide which component to invoke. It's the developer who decides which view to find using findViewById(). The developer specifies the ID of the view they want to find.\n\nwhat will happen in such case?\n\nIf you call setContentView() with layout1 and then call setContentView() with layout2, the system will replace the current view hierarchy with the new layout.
