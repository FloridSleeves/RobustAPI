But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: How to write text to a file in Java: :I'm new to java and currently trying to write some strings into a text file using this tut :http://www.homeandlearn.co.uk/java/write_to_textfile.htmlso here is my code :public void savefile() throws IOException {          JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null,\"Hi,i'm in Try Block :|\");    FileWriter write = new FileWriter(\"asd.txt\", true);    PrintWriter print = new PrintWriter(write);    JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, \"File Opened\");    write.write(\"Knock Knock\");    print.flush();    print.write(\"Hello ?\");    print.flush();    print.printf(\"Hi?\");    print.flush();    print.println(\"anybody there?\");    print.flush();    JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, \"Can you hear me ?\");    print.close();    JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, \"File Closed\");         }and this is how I call the method:try {    savefile();}catch (IOException e) {    JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, \"Error: \" + e.getMessage());}But nothing appears in the file!

I'm really sick of this; what did I do wrong?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: print.write(\"Knock Knock\");\n<<<explanation>>>: You are using PrintWriter.write which writes the string directly to the underlying output stream. If you want to write a line terminator you should use PrintWriter.println.\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java:\n\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"file.txt\"));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\nreader.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The BufferedReader.readLine() method reads a line of text. It returns null if the end of the stream has been reached.\nQuestion: How to write a file in Java:\n\nPlease using this api: FileOutputStream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileOutputStream\n<<<code>>>: FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(\"file.txt\");\nString data = \"This is some data\";\nfos.write(data.getBytes());\nfos.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The FileOutputStream class is used for writing data to a file. It is part of the Java I/O package and it is used for writing streams of raw bytes such as image data, audio, video etc.\n\n\nA: You are writing to the PrintWriter, which is a character-oriented stream, not a byte-oriented stream. When you write a string to it, it converts it to bytes using the platform's default character encoding, which may not result in the expected output.\nInstead, you should use a byte-oriented stream, such as FileOutputStream, to write the data to a file. Here's an example:\ntry (FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(\"file.txt\")) {\n    fos.write(\"1\\n\".getBytes());\n    fos.write(\"2\\n\".getBytes());\n    fos.write(\"3\\n\".getBytes());\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n\nIn this code, \"\\n\" is used to separate the lines. The getBytes() method is used to convert the strings to bytes. The try-with-resources statement is used to automatically close the FileOutputStream when it's no longer needed.\n\nA: The problem is that you are writing strings to a character-oriented stream (PrintWriter), not a byte-oriented stream (FileOutputStream). When you write a string to a PrintWriter, it converts the string to bytes using the platform's default character encoding. This may not give you the expected output if the platform's default character encoding is not UTF-8 or ASCII.\nTo write to a file in Java, you should use a byte-oriented stream. Here's how you can do it:\ntry (FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(\"file.txt\")) {\n    fos.write(\"1\\n\".getBytes());\n    fos.write(\"2\\n\".getBytes());\n    fos.write(\"3\\n\".getBytes());\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n\nIn this code, \"\\n\" is used to separate the lines.
