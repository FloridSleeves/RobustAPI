I wrote objects at various locations in the file. The objects were of variable sizes but all of the same class.Now I want to read from such a file. I dont want to have to specify the number of bytes to read. I want to be able to read the object directly using Object Input Stream. How to achieve this ? I have to use Random Access Files because I need to write to different positions in file.\n\nYou can read the object directly using ObjectInputStream. But you need to know the size of the object beforehand. If you don't know the size, you can write the size of the object before writing the object itself.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```java\n// Write the object\nObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(\"file.txt\"));\nout.writeObject(myObject);\nout.close();\n\n// Read the object\nObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream(\"file.txt\"));\nObject myObject = in.readObject();\nin.close();\n```\n\nIf you want to read the object directly from the file without knowing the size beforehand, you can use a loop to read the objects until the end of the file.\n\n```java\nObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream(\"file.txt\"));\nObject myObject;\ntry {\n    while ((myObject = in.readObject()) != null) {\n        // process myObject\n    }\n} catch (EOFException e) {\n    // end of file reached\n}\nin.close();\n```\n\nIn this case, you need to ensure that the objects you write to the file are serializable.\n\nPlease using this api: FileChannel.write.\n\n```java\n// Write the object\nByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();\nObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(baos);\nout.writeObject(myObject);\nout.close();\n\nbyte[] objectBytes = baos.toByteArray();\n\nFileChannel fileChannel = new FileChannel(new FileOutputStream(\"file.txt\"));\nfileChannel.write(ByteBuffer.wrap(objectBytes));\nfileChannel.close();\n\n// Read the object\nFileChannel fileChannel = new FileChannel(new FileInputStream(\"file.txt\"));\nByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate((int) fileChannel.size());\nfileChannel.read(buffer);\nfileChannel.close();\n\nByteArrayInputStream bais = new ByteArrayInputStream(buffer.array());\nObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(bais);\nObject myObject = in.readObject();\nin.close();\n```\n\nThis code writes the object to a ByteArrayOutputStream, then writes the bytes of the ByteArrayOutputStream to a FileChannel. It reads the bytes from the FileChannel into a ByteBuffer, then reads the object from the ByteBuffer using a ByteArrayInputStream and ObjectInputStream.\n\n\nQuestion: OutOfMemory Exception when multithreading ... heap space?:\n\nThe OutOfMemoryError exception is thrown when the Java Virtual Machine cannot allocate an object because it is out of memory, and no more memory could be made available by the garbage collector.\n\nIn your case, the problem seems to be related to the heap space. You are creating a large String (8MB) and then creating 2 threads that use this string to write to a certain memory space concurrently. This could be causing an OutOfMemoryError exception because the heap space is not enough to hold the large String and the threads.\n\nYou can try to optimize your code by:\n\n1. Reducing the size of the large String.\n2. Using a more efficient data structure to hold the large String.\n3. Im"}
