But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: How implement generic Server-Sent Events Servlet: :I'm trying implement server code of Server-Sent Events in a generic way that any Object of my application could send a message to client, so I've decided implement a specific Servlet just for SSE. The initial test codes worked like a charm, but wasn't flexible enought to send messages from different parts of my application. So I've rewrite the code in a way that all objects that has a reference to Servlet object could send a message to the clients:public class PushServlet extends HttpServlet {    private Thread threadServlet;    private boolean processando=true;    private MensagemSSEBean mensagem;    @Override    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {        threadServlet=Thread.currentThread();        response.setContentType(\"text/event-stream; charset=utf-8\");        while (processando){            if(!pausarThread())                break;            enviarMensagemParaOCliente(response.getWriter());        }        enviarMensagemDeFechamento(response.getWriter());    }    private void enviarMensagemParaOCliente(PrintWriter saida) {        ConversorMensagemSSE conversor = new ConversorMensagemSSE();        saida.print(conversor.converter(mensagem));        saida.flush();    }    private synchronized void enviarMensagemDeFechamento(PrintWriter saida) {        mensagem.setMensagem(\"#FECHAR_CONEXAO#\");        enviarMensagemParaOCliente(saida);        saida.close();    }    public synchronized void enviarMensagem(MensagemSSEBean mensagem) throws IOException {        this.mensagem=mensagem;        threadServlet.notifyAll();    }    public synchronized void finalizar(){        processando=false;    }    private boolean pausarThread() {        try {            threadServlet.wait();            return true;        } catch (InterruptedException e) {            e.printStackTrace();          }        return false;    }}As you can see, I pause the Servlet Thread until something call \"enviarMensagem\". I didn't tested this code, basically cause I don't know how I can get this Servlet object. Could someone explain me how could I get this Servlet object from any Object??

The message is followed by two newline characters to indicate the end of the event.\nQuestion: How to handle multiple clients in a Java Socket Server:\nI have a simple Java Socket Server that listens for connections from multiple clients. I'm using a while loop to keep accepting connections and then start a new thread for each client. However, I'm not sure how to handle multiple clients.\n\nPlease using this api: ServerSocket.accept.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: ServerSocket.accept\n<<<code>>>: while (!serverSocket.isClosed()) {\n    Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();\n    new ClientHandler(clientSocket).start();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The serverSocket.accept() method will block until a client connects to the server. You can call this method inside a while loop to keep accepting connections. Each time a client connects, a new ClientHandler thread is started to handle communication with that client.\n\nPlease using this api: ServerSocket.isClosed.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: ServerSocket.isClosed\n<<<code>>>: while (!serverSocket.isClosed()) {\n    Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();\n    new ClientHandler(clientSocket).start();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The ServerSocket.isClosed() method returns true if the server socket is closed, and false otherwise. You can use this method in your while loop condition to keep accepting connections until the server socket is closed.\n\nPlease using this api: Socket.getInputStream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Socket.getInputStream\n<<<code>>>: InputStream inputStream = clientSocket.getInputStream();\n<<<explanation>>>: The Socket.getInputStream() method returns an InputStream that can be used to read data from the client socket. You can use this InputStream in a BufferedReader to read data from the client.\n\nPlease using this api: Socket.getOutputStream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Socket.getOutputStream\n<<<code>>>: OutputStream outputStream = clientSocket.getOutputStream();\n<<<explanation>>>: The Socket.getOutputStream() method returns an OutputStream that can be used to write data to the client socket. You can use this OutputStream in a PrintWriter to write data to the client.\n\nPlease using this api: Socket.close.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Socket.close\n<<<code>>>: clientSocket.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The Socket.close() method closes the socket and releases any system resources associated with it. After a socket is closed, you can't use it to read or write data.\n\nPlease using this api: Thread.start.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Thread.start\n<<<code>>>: new ClientHandler(clientSocket).start();\n<<<explanation>>>: The Thread.start() method starts a new thread of execution that runs the code in the run() method of the Thread subclass. In your case, the ClientHandler class should override the run() method to handle communication with a client.\n\nPlease using this api: Thread.interrupt.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Thread.interrupt\n<<<code>>>: thread.interrupt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The Thread.interrupt() method interrupts the current thread. This can be used to signal that the thread should stop what it's doing and clean up resources. The thread should check if it has been interrupted and respond appropriately.\n\nPlease using this api: Thread.isInterrupted.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Thread.isInterrupted\n<<<code>>>: if (Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) {\n    // Handle interruption\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The Thread.isInterrupted() method returns true if the current thread has been interrupted, and false otherwise. You can use this method in your code to check if the thread has been interrupted and respond accordingly.\n\nPlease using this api: Thread.sleep.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Thread.sleep\n<<<code>>>: Thread.sleep(1000);\n<<<explanation>>>: The Thread.sleep() method causes the current thread to suspend execution"}
