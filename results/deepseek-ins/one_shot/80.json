When you send text that contains emojis, you're using UTF-8 encoding, which can't represent all characters. This is why emojis are being replaced with other characters.\nTo solve this, you should use the ISO-8859-1 encoding, which can represent all characters, including emojis. Here's how you can modify your code:\n```kotlin\nprivate fun buildTextPart(dataOutputStream: DataOutputStream, parameterName: String, parameterValue: String) {\n    dataOutputStream.writeBytes(\"$twoHyphens$boundary$lineEnd\")\n    dataOutputStream.writeBytes(\"Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"$parameterName\\\"$lineEnd\")\n    dataOutputStream.writeBytes(\"Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1$lineEnd$lineEnd\")\n    dataOutputStream.write(parameterValue.toByteArray(Charset.forName(\"ISO-8859-1\")))\n    dataOutputStream.writeBytes(lineEnd)\n}\n```\nIn this code, I've changed the encoding of the text to ISO-8859-1 and used the `toByteArray` method with the ISO-8859-1 charset to convert the string to a byte array. This should ensure that the emojis are correctly sent.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that `twoHyphens`, `boundary`, and `lineEnd` are defined and are appropriate values for your use case.\n\nI hope this helps you.
