But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: How to write data to a String when in a for-loop: :So basically I have this database that is a for loop. It gives a different score every time, which I need to save to a String (or file, but I guess a string would be easier, because I need it to be empty at every new call for the database).I want to store all the scores by going through the loop, and then adding a , after each score (to keep them seperate) but my code isn't working because a part of the code is outside the for loop. How do I fix this? Or are there better/other methods to do what I want to create?DatabaseHandler db = new DatabaseHandler(camera.this);List<Database> contacts = db.getAllContacts();for (Database contact : contacts) {    String test = contact.getMP();    StringWriter stringWriter = new StringWriter();    PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(stringWriter);    printWriter.println(test);}  printWriter.flush();printWriter.close();return stringWriter.toString();\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem.

This is more efficient than using a String and += because StringBuilder is mutable and doesn't create a new object every time you append. After the loop, you can convert the StringBuilder back to a String with toString().\nQuestion: How to write data to a String when in a for-loop:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: StringWriter\n<<<code>>>: StringWriter stringWriter = new StringWriter(); PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(stringWriter); for (Database contact : contacts) { printWriter.println(contact.getMP()); } printWriter.flush(); printWriter.close(); return stringWriter.toString();\n<<<explanation>>>: Use a StringWriter to write to a String.

The BufferedReader reads until it encounters a newline character, so it stops reading after the first newline it encounters.\nYou should use PrintWriter.println() to write each line followed by a newline. This is equivalent to calling PrintWriter.write() followed by PrintWriter.flush().\nHere is how you can modify your code:\nPrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream());\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\nprintWriter.flush();\n\nAnd then to read the data:\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());  // This will print \"1\"\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());  // This will print \"2\"\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());  // This will print \"3\"\n\nThis way, each line of text will be sent separately and each line of text will be received separately.\n\nA: The issue is that you are not writing a newline character after each line of text.
