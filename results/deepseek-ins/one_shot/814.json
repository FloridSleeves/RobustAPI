But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\n\n\nA: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\n\nYou can solve this problem by adding a line break character (\"\\n\") after each string you write. Here is an example:\n\n```java\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\\n\");\n```\n\nThen, when you read the lines from the BufferedReader, you should be able to read each line separately:\n\n```java\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine()); // prints \"1\"\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine()); // prints \"2\"\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine()); // prints \"3\"\n```\n\nThis way, each line will be read separately and you should be able to process each line separately.\n\nPlease note that the line break character (\"\\n\") is used in Unix-based systems. If you are using Windows, you should use the carriage return and line feed characters (\"\\r\\n\").\n\n```java\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\\r\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\\r\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\\r\\n\");\n```\n\n```java\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine()); // prints \"1\"\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine()); // prints \"2\"\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine()); // prints \"3\"\n```\n\nI hope this helps.
