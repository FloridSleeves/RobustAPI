Note that this will make a solution.\n\nA: To increment a Map value in Java, you can use the `put()` method of the Map interface. If the key already exists in the map, the put() method replaces the old value with the new one. If the key does not exist in the map, the put() method adds the key-value pair to the map.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.HashMap;\nimport java.util.Map;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Map<String, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();\n        String word = \"hello\";\n\n        Integer count = freq.get(word);\n        if (count == null) {\n            freq.put(word, 1);\n        } else {\n            freq.put(word, count + 1);\n        }\n\n        System.out.println(freq);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we first create a HashMap named `freq` to store the word frequency. We then get the current count of the word using the `get()` method. If the count is null (meaning the word does not exist in the map), we put the word with a count of 1. If the count is not null, we increment the count by 1 and put the updated count back into the map.\n\nFor your second question, you can use a custom Comparator to sort the ArrayList of HashMaps based on the value of a specific key. Here is an example:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        ArrayList<HashMap<String, String>> list = new ArrayList<>();\n        HashMap<String, String> map1 = new HashMap<>();\n        map1.put(\"title\", \"title1\");\n        map1.put(\"link\", \"link1\");\n        map1.put(\"number\", \"3\");\n        list.add(map1);\n\n        HashMap<String, String> map2 = new HashMap<>();\n        map2.put(\"title\", \"title2\");\n        map2.put(\"link\", \"link2\");\n        map2.put(\"number\", \"1\");\n        list.add(map2);\n\n        HashMap<String, String> map3 = new HashMap<>();\n        map3.put(\"title\", \"title3\");\n        map3.put(\"link\", \"link3\");\n        map3.put(\"number\", \"8\");\n        list.add(map3);\n\n        Collections.sort(list, new Comparator<HashMap<String, String>>() {\n            @Override\n            public int compare(HashMap<String, String> o1, HashMap<String, String> o2) {\n                return Integer.compare(Integer.parseInt(o1.get(\"number\")), Integer.parseInt(o2.get(\"number\")));\n            }\n        });\n\n        for (HashMap<String, String> map : list) {\n            System.out.println(map);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we create an ArrayList of HashMaps and add three HashMaps to it. Each HashMap has three keys: \"title\", \"link\", and \"number\". We then sort the ArrayList based on the \"number\" key using a custom Comparator. The compare() method of the Comparator converts the \"number\" values from String to int and compares them. The ArrayList is then printed to verify the sorting.\n\nPlease note that the above code assumes that the \"number\" values in the HashMaps are valid integers. If they are not, you may need to add error checking code to handle invalid input.\n\nI hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\n"}
