But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: How to create a txt file in Java?: :I'm just want a program to register a user and then create a txt file to store there the information. I know it has to be with createNewFile method but I do not know how to use it.

The method returns a boolean value indicating whether the file was successfully created or not. The file is created in the project directory.\n\nA: The problem is that you are writing the strings \"1\", \"2\" and \"3\" without a line break. The BufferedReader.readLine() method reads a line from the stream, which it does by reading characters until it encounters a line separator. Since you are not providing a line separator, it reads all the characters and returns them as a single string.\nYou can solve this by adding a line separator after each string. Here is how you can do it:\nprintWriter.write(\"1\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\\n\");\n\nThis will ensure that each string is followed by a line separator, which will be read by the BufferedReader.\n\nA: You are writing each line as a separate string without a newline character.
