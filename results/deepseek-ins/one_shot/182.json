It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Java code to execute a .sh file: :I have a .sh file stored in some Linux system.

It is more flexible and safer than Runtime.exec() because it allows you to specify the working directory and environment variables.\nQuestion: How to get the current date and time in Android: :I want to get the current date and time in Android. How can I do this?\nPlease using this api: Calendar.getInstance().\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Calendar.getInstance()\n<<<code>>>: \nCalendar c = Calendar.getInstance();\nint year = c.get(Calendar.YEAR);\nint month = c.get(Calendar.MONTH);\nint day = c.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH);\nint hour = c.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY);\nint minute = c.get(Calendar.MINUTE);\nint second = c.get(Calendar.SECOND);\n<<<explanation>>>: The Calendar class in Java provides a way to get the current date and time. You can use the get() method of the Calendar class to get the year, month, day of month, hour of day, minute, and second. Note that the month is zero-based, so January is 0 and December is 11.\nQuestion: How to get the current date and time in Android: :I want to get the current date and time in Android. How can I do this?\nPlease using this api: SimpleDateFormat.format().\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: SimpleDateFormat\n<<<code>>>: \nSimpleDateFormat sdf = new SimpleDateFormat(\"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss\");\nString currentDateandTime = sdf.format(new Date());\n<<<explanation>>>: The SimpleDateFormat class in Java provides a way to format dates and times. You can use it to get the current date and time in a specific format. In this case, we are using the format \"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss\" to get the current date and time in the format of \"year-month-day hour:minute:second\".\nQuestion: How to get the current date and time in Android: :I want to get the current date and time in Android. How can I do this?\nPlease using this api: Date.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Date\n<<<code>>>: \nDate currentDate = new Date();\n<<<explanation>>>: The Date class in Java provides a way to get the current date and time. You can create a new Date object to get the current date and time.\n\n\nA: You can use the following code to get the current date and time in Android:\nCalendar c = Calendar.getInstance();\nint year = c.get(Calendar.YEAR);\nint month = c.get(Calendar.MONTH);\nint day = c.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH);\nint hour = c.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY);\nint minute = c.get(Calendar.MINUTE);\nint second = c.get(Calendar.SECOND);\n\nThis will give you the current year, month, day, hour, minute, and second. The month is zero-based, so January is 0 and December is 11.\n\nA: You can use the following code to get the current date and time in Android:\nSimpleDateFormat sdf = new SimpleDateFormat(\"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss\");\nString currentDateandTime = sdf.format(new Date());\n\nThis will give you the current date and time in the format \"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss\".\n\nA: You can use the following code to get the current date and time in Android:\nDate currentDate = new Date();\n\nThis will give you the current date and time.\n\nA: You can use the following code to get the current date and time in Android:\nDateFormat df = DateFormat.getDateTimeInstance();\nString currentDateandTime = df.format(new Date());\n\nThis will give you the current date and time in a user-friendly format"}
