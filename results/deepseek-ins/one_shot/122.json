But BitmapFactory.decodeByteArray() expects a byte array that represents a PNG or JPEG image, not a byte array that represents a BufferedImage. So, you need to convert the BufferedImage to a byte array that represents a PNG or JPEG image. This can be done using ImageIO.write().\n\nA: The problem is not with the emojis, but with the encoding of the text. The emojis are being replaced with \"?\" because the text is being encoded as ASCII, which doesn't support emojis.\nYou can solve this by changing the encoding of the text to UTF-8. Here's how you can do it:\n```kotlin\noverride fun getByteData(): MutableMap<String, FileDataPart> {\n    val params = HashMap<String, FileDataPart>()\n    params[\"file\"] = FileDataPart(\n        \"file$rndInt\",\n        getBytes(finalInputSteam!!)!!,\n        \"UTF-8\" // Change the encoding to UTF-8\n    )\n    return params\n}\n```\nThis will ensure that the text is encoded using UTF-8, which supports a wide range of characters, including emojis.\n\nAlso, ensure that the server is configured to accept UTF-8 encoding. If the server is not configured to accept UTF-8, you may need to change the server-side code to handle UTF-8 encoding.\n\nPlease note that the server-side code is not provided in your question, so you may need to consult the documentation or source code of the server to understand how to handle UTF-8 encoding.\n\nLastly, ensure that the client and server are using the same character encoding. If the client is using a different character encoding than the server, you may need to change the client-side code to use the same character encoding as the server.\n\nI hope this helps. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.\n\n\nA: The problem is not with the emojis, but with the encoding of the text.
