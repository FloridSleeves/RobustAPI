Thanks to both answerersPeter's answer is better because it uses less space. It uses 1 bit per boolean value, which is 1/8th the space of using 1 character per boolean value.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Boolean array to binary conversion\n<<<code>>>: \npublic byte[] booleanArrayToByteArray(boolean[] boolArray) {\n    int byteArrayLength = (boolArray.length + 7) / 8;\n    byte[] byteArray = new byte[byteArrayLength];\n    for (int i = 0; i < boolArray.length; i++) {\n        int byteIndex = i / 8;\n        int bitIndex = i % 8;\n        if (boolArray[i]) {\n            byteArray[byteIndex] |= (1 << bitIndex);\n        }\n    }\n    return byteArray;\n}\n\nAnd for the reverse:\npublic boolean[] byteArrayToBooleanArray(byte[] byteArray) {\n    boolean[] boolArray = new boolean[byteArray.length * 8];\n    for (int i = 0; i < byteArray.length; i++) {\n        for (int bitIndex = 0; bitIndex < 8; bitIndex++) {\n            boolArray[i * 8 + bitIndex] = ((byteArray[i] >> bitIndex) & 1) == 1;\n        }\n    }\n    return boolArray;\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: This is a common way to convert a boolean array to a byte array and vice versa.

You should read the entire buffer at once.\n\nYou can use the following code:\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint length = -1;\nint totalBytesRead = 0;\n\nwhile (totalBytesRead < 4) {\n    int bytesRead = is.read(buffer, totalBytesRead, 4 - totalBytesRead);\n    if (bytesRead == -1) {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    totalBytesRead += bytesRead;\n}\n\nif (totalBytesRead == 4)"}
