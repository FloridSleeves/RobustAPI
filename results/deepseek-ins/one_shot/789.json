You should call flush() method after writing to the PrintWriter.\nQuestion: How to use the Java Socket API to send a file over a network?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Socket.getOutputStream().write\n<<<code>>>: try (Socket socket = new Socket(\"localhost\", 1234);\n    FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(new File(\"file.txt\"));) {\n    byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\n    int bytesRead;\n    OutputStream outputStream = socket.getOutputStream();\n    while ((bytesRead = fis.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n        outputStream.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);\n    }\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You can use the OutputStream.write method to send a file over a network. You read the file in a byte array and then write this array to the output stream of the socket.\nQuestion: How to use the Java Socket API to receive a file over a network?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Socket.getInputStream().read\n<<<code>>>: try (ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(1234);\n    Socket socket = serverSocket.accept();\n    FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(new File(\"received.txt\"));) {\n    byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\n    int bytesRead;\n    InputStream inputStream = socket.getInputStream();\n    while ((bytesRead = inputStream.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n        fos.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);\n    }\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You can use the InputStream.read method to receive a file over a network. You read the input stream into a byte array and then write this array to a file.\n\n\nA: The problem is that you are writing the strings \"1\", \"2\", and \"3\" without a line break in between. The BufferedReader.readLine() method reads a line from the stream, and it stops reading when it encounters a line terminator, which is a newline character ('\\n') or a carriage return ('\\r') or a carriage return followed immediately by a newline.\n\nIn your case, since you are not providing a line terminator, the BufferedReader is reading all the characters and returning them as a single string \"123\".\n\nTo fix this, you should write a line terminator after each string. You can use the newline character ('\\n') for this:\n\n```java\nprintWriter.write(\"1\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\\n\");\n```\n\nNow, when you read the lines with BufferedReader, each readLine() call will return one of the three strings \"1\", \"2\", and \"3\", separately:\n\n```java\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());  // prints \"1\"\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());  // prints \"2\"\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());  // prints \"3\"\n```\n\nThis should solve your problem.\n\nA: The problem is that you are writing the strings \"1\", \"2\", and \"3\" without a line break in between.
