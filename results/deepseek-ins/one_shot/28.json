I understand the process of id generation is automated, which gets added to R.java For instance, if we have same IDs, say \"image1\" in two XMLs, say \"layout1\" & \"layout2\". but in R.java it won't have 2 IDs. that means at a time it will reference only 1 component.

The parameters are the name of the resource, the type of the resource, and the package name.\n\nA: \nwhy doesn't it give error just like we get in java code?\n\nBecause in Android, the ids are used to identify views in the layout, and the system automatically generates unique ids for each view. If you define the same id in two different layouts, the system will automatically assign the same id to the views in both layouts. This is why you don't get an error - the system is just making sure that the ids are unique.\n\nhow does environment decide to which component it needs to invoke?\n\nThe environment decides which component to invoke based on the ids of the views in the layout. When you call findViewById(), you pass in the id of the view you want to find, and the system returns the view that has that id.\n\nwhat will happen in such case?\n\nIf you set the content view of an activity with one layout and then set the content view of a popup window with another layout, the activity will still have the views from the first layout. The popup window will have the views from the second layout. The activity and the popup window are separate instances of the activity class, so they have separate view hierarchies.\n\nhow i would the sending and receiving end would look like\n\nIn the sending end, you would use putExtra() to send the name of the layout file you want to load. In the receiving end, you would use getStringExtra() to retrieve the name of the layout file, and then use getIdentifier() to get the resource id of the layout file. You would then use setContentView() to load the layout.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nHere's an example of how you might do this:\n\nIn the sending activity:\n\n```java\nIntent intent = new Intent(this, ReceivingActivity.class);\nintent.putExtra(\"layoutName\", \"a_layout\");\nstartActivity(intent);\n```\n\nIn the receiving activity:\n\n```java\nString layoutName = getIntent().getStringExtra(\"layoutName\");\nint layoutResource = getResources().getIdentifier(layoutName, \"layout\", getPackageName());\nsetContentView(layoutResource);\n```\n\nIn this example, if you sent \"a_layout\" in the intent, the receiving activity would load the layout file R.layout.a_layout. If you sent \"b_layout\", it would load R.layout.b_layout.\n\nPlease note that the getIdentifier() method returns the resource id of the layout file, not the layout itself. You can then use setContentView() with this resource id to load the layout.\n\nI hope this helps clarify things for you.
