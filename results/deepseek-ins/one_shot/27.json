In case we have to use 2 XMLs in an Activity, one as activity.setcontentview(layout1) and another as a PopupWindow.setContentView(layout2). What will happen in such case?\n\nYou're correct. When you call setContentView() with a layout resource ID, the system inflates the corresponding XML file and sets it as the root view for the activity. This means that the views in the inflated layout are part of the view hierarchy of the activity, and you can findViewById() to access them.\n\nIf you're trying to display ads on a custom canvas, you're probably thinking of using a SurfaceView or a custom View subclass. These are both valid approaches, and they can be used to draw on a custom canvas.\n\nHere's a basic example of how you might use a SurfaceView to draw an image:\n\n```java\npublic class MySurfaceView extends SurfaceView implements SurfaceHolder.Callback {\n    private SurfaceHolder mHolder;\n    private Bitmap mBitmap;\n\n    public MySurfaceView(Context context) {\n        super(context);\n\n        mHolder = getHolder();\n        mHolder.addCallback(this);\n\n        mBitmap = BitmapFactory.decodeResource(getResources(), R.drawable.my_image);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void surfaceCreated(SurfaceHolder holder) {\n        Canvas canvas = mHolder.lockCanvas();\n        canvas.drawBitmap(mBitmap, 0, 0, null);\n        mHolder.unlockCanvasAndPost(canvas);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void surfaceChanged(SurfaceHolder holder, int format, int width, int height) {\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void surfaceDestroyed(SurfaceHolder holder) {\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, MySurfaceView is a custom View subclass that uses a SurfaceView to draw an image. The image is loaded from a resource (R.drawable.my_image), and the drawBitmap() method is used to draw it on the canvas.\n\nYou can then use MySurfaceView in your activity layout, and it will draw the image when it's inflated:\n\n```xml\n<com.example.MySurfaceView\n    android:id=\"@+id/my_surface_view\"\n    android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n    android:layout_height=\"match_parent\" />\n```\n\nRemember, though, that SurfaceView is more complex than other"}
