The iterator is reset to the beginning of the list after it has iterated through all elements. The modulus operator is used to ensure that the iterator wraps around to the start of the list when it reaches the end.\n\nA: The issue is with this line:\nnames.add(dataSnapshot.getChildren().iterator().next().getValue(String.class));\n\nYou are creating a new iterator for each child in the loop, and then calling next() on that. This means you are always getting the first child's value, because you are always calling next() on the same iterator.\nInstead, you should use the iterator of the outer loop:\nfor (DataSnapshot dataSnapshot1:dataSnapshot.getChildren()) {\n    i = i + 1;\n    names.add(dataSnapshot1.getValue(String.class));\n}\n\nThis way, you are getting the value of each child in turn, and adding it to the list.\n\nA: You are using the same iterator for all children. You should use the iterator of the current child in the loop.\nHere is the corrected code:\nfor (DataSnapshot dataSnapshot1:dataSnapshot.getChildren()) {\n    i = i + 1;\n    names.add(dataSnapshot1.getValue(String.class));\n}\n\nThis way, you are getting the value of each child in turn, and adding it to the list.\n\nA: You are using the same iterator for all children.
