It returns null if the stream ends. In your case, you are calling this method only once, so it reads only the first line. If you want to read all lines, you should call this method in a loop until it returns null.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem.

This is causing the data to be flushed immediately, and you are only seeing the last line of data.\nInstead, you should close the PrintWriter after all the data has been written. Here's how you can do it:\nPrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true);\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nprintWriter.close();\n\nThen, on the receiving side, you can read all lines using a loop:\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n\nThis will print each line of data separately.\n\nA: The problem is that you are closing the PrintWriter after each write.
