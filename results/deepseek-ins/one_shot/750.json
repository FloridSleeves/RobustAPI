So, if you want to read multiple lines, you should call this method in a loop until it returns null.\n\nA: The problem is that you are not sending newline characters between your lines. When you call write(\"1\"), write(\"2\"), and write(\"3\"), they are all written to the same line because there are no newline characters.\nWhen you call readLine(), it reads until it encounters a newline character. Since there are no newline characters in your write() calls, it reads all of the characters and returns them as a single string.\nTo fix this, you need to call write(\"\\n\") after each write() to send a newline character. Here's how you can do it:\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nprintWriter.write(\"\\n\");\n\nThen, when you read the lines in your BufferedReader, you should call readLine() three times to get each line:\nString line1 = bufferedReader.readLine();\nString line2 = bufferedReader.readLine();\nString line3 = bufferedReader.readLine();\n\nSystem.out.println(line1);  // prints \"1\"\nSystem.out.println(line2);  // prints \"2\"\nSystem.out.println(line3);  // prints \"3\"\n\nThis way, each write() call sends a newline character, and each readLine() call reads a line of text.\n\nA: The problem is that you are not sending newline characters between your lines.
