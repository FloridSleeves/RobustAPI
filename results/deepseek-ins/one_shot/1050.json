It returns null if the end of the stream has been reached. This is more efficient than using a StringTokenizer because it reads directly from the stream, avoiding the need to create a StringTokenizer object for each line.\n\n\nA: StringTokenizer.nextToken() does not skip over empty fields. It simply returns the next token from the string. If there are consecutive delimiters, it will return an empty string.\nIf you want to include empty fields, you should use String.split() instead. It will return an array of strings, including empty fields.\nHere is an example:\nString strLine = \"one->two->->three\";\nString[] fields = strLine.split(\"->\");\nfor (String field : fields) {\n    System.out.println(field);\n}\n\nThis will output:\none\ntwo\n\n(empty string)\n\nthree\n\nNote that the split() method uses the specified delimiter to split the string into tokens.
