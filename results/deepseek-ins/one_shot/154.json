It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time.

Suppose there are 6 clients connected to the server at the same time and each of the clients are sending some commands to server at the same time. If these clients sending the message to server for every 1 second how can I handle the those messages from the 6 clients on the server side to store it in the table and the acknowledgement to each client. How can i handle these input from from the client. Whether I have to create 6 threads to handle these inputs from the client.

Please give me a idea to approach this issue.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: You can use a thread pool to handle multiple clients. Each client can have its own thread to handle the communication. You can use a ThreadPoolExecutor to manage the threads.\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.net.*;\nimport java.util.concurrent.*;\n\npublic class SocketServer {\n    private static final int PORT = 1235;\n    private static final int NUM_THREADS = 6;\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(PORT);\n        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(NUM_THREADS);\n\n        while (true) {\n            Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();\n            executor.execute(new ClientHandler(clientSocket));\n        }\n    }\n\n    static class ClientHandler implements Runnable {\n        private Socket clientSocket;\n\n        public ClientHandler(Socket socket) {\n            this.clientSocket = socket;\n        }\n\n        public void run() {\n            try {\n                InputStream input = clientSocket.getInputStream();\n                BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(input));\n\n                String message;\n                while ((message = reader.readLine()) != null) {\n                    // Process the message and send an acknowledgement\n                    System.out.println(\"Received message: \" + message);\n                    // Store the message in the table\n                    // Send acknowledgement to the client\n                }\n            } catch (IOException e) {\n                e.printStackTrace();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code creates a server that listens for multiple clients. Each client is handled by a separate thread in a thread pool. The ClientHandler class reads messages from each client and processes them. It also sends acknowledgements to each client.\n\nPlease note that this is a simple example and does not include error handling or cleanup code. You may need to adjust it to fit your specific needs.\n\nAlso, remember that socket communication is inherently asynchronous. If you need to handle multiple clients in a synchronous manner, you may need to use a different approach, such as a message queue or a similar mechanism.\n\nThis code assumes that each message is sent as a line of text. If your messages are sent in a different format, you will need to adjust the message reading code accordingly.\n\nThis code also assumes that you want to store each message in a table. If you need to store the messages in a different way, you will need to adjust the message storage code accordingly.\n\nThis code also assumes that you want to send an acknowledgement to each client. If you need to send the acknowledgements in a different way, you will need to adjust the acknowledgement sending code accordingly.\n\nThis code uses a thread pool to handle multiple clients. If you have a large number of clients, you may need to increase the number of threads in the thread pool.\n\nThis code uses a blocking read to handle each message. If you have a large number of clients or large messages, you may need to use a non-blocking read or a different approach to handle the messages.\n\nThis code uses a single thread to handle each client. If you need to handle each client in a different way, you may need to use a different approach, such as a message queue or a similar mechanism.\n\nThis code uses a single thread to handle each client.
