Here is how you can modify your code:\nURL url = new URL(\"http://example.com/largefile.txt\");\nURLConnection connection = url.openConnection();\nInputStream input = new BufferedInputStream(connection.getInputStream(), 1024);\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\nint bytesRead;\nwhile ((bytesRead = input.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n    // process the data in buffer\n}\ninput.close();\n\nIn this code, BufferedInputStream is used to read the file in chunks of 1024 bytes. The second parameter to the BufferedInputStream constructor is the buffer size, which is 1024 bytes in this case. The read() method of BufferedInputStream will read up to the buffer size, so it will read 1024 bytes at a time.\n\nA: You can use a BufferedInputStream to read the file in chunks of "}
