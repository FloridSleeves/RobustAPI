System.getProperty(\"line.separator\") will give you the correct line separator for your operating system.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem. That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: String line = bufferedReader.readLine();\n<<<explanation>>>: The BufferedReader.readLine() method reads a line of text. It returns null if the stream has reached the end. In your case, you are only reading one line, so it returns \"123\" and then you print it. If you want to read each line separately, you should call readLine() in a loop until it returns null.\nQuestion: How to get the current date and time in java?\n\nPlease using this api: java.util.Calendar.getInstance.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: java.util.Calendar.getInstance\n<<<code>>>: Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();\nDate date = calendar.getTime();\nSimpleDateFormat sdf = new SimpleDateFormat(\"dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm:ss\");\nString currentDateAndTime = sdf.format(date);\n<<<explanation>>>: The java.util.Calendar.getInstance() method returns a Calendar instance representing the current date and time. The getTime() method of the Calendar class returns a Date object representing the same point in time. The SimpleDateFormat class is used to format the date and time. The format \"dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm:ss\" represents the date in the format day-month-year hour:minute:second.\n\n\nA: The issue is that you are writing the lines without a line separator. When you read the lines with BufferedReader, it treats the newline character as the end of the line. So, it reads \"123\" as one line.\nYou can fix this by adding a line separator after each write. Here's how you can do it:\nprintWriter.write(\"1\" + System.lineSeparator());\nprintWriter.write(\"2\" + System.lineSeparator());\nprintWriter.write(\"3\" + System.lineSeparator());\n\nSystem.lineSeparator() is a platform-dependent line separator. It's generally recommended to use it instead of hardcoding the line separator.\nAlso, you should close the PrintWriter after you're done writing to it. This can be done by calling printWriter.close().\n\nA: The issue is that you are writing the lines without a line separator.
