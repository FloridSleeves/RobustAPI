But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: How to pass parameters from servlet to JavaScript: :I am working on a board game with dynamic board size of 5x5,...,8x8This should be a game that runs on a web.

The BufferedReader reads until it finds a line separator, which it doesn't find because you didn't write one.\nYou should write a line separator after each string. The line separator is platform-dependent, but you can use \"\\n\" or \"\\r\\n\" (for Windows) or \"\\r\" (for Mac).\nHere is the corrected code:\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\\n\");\n\nOr if you want to write all the strings in one go:\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\\n2\\n3\\n\");\n\nThen, when you read the lines, you should read them one by one:\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\n\nThis will print each line separately.\n\nA: The problem is that you are writing the strings without a line break.
