The byte offset of a line is the position of the first character of the line, so we subtract the length of the line to get the byte offset of the start of the line.\nQuestion: How to get the last value of an ArrayList: How to get the last value of an ArrayList?\nPlease using this api: List.get.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: List.get\n<<<code>>>: E e = list.get(list.size() - 1);\n<<<explanation>>>: First get the size of the list, then the last element is at index size - 1.\nQuestion: How to get the last value of an ArrayList: How to get the last value of an ArrayList?\nPlease using this api: List.get.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: List.get\n<<<code>>>: E e = list.get(list.size() - 1);\n<<<explanation>>>: First get the size of the list, then the last element is at index size - 1.\nQuestion: How to get the last value of an ArrayList: How to get the last value of an ArrayList?\nPlease using this api: List.get.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: List.get\n<<<code>>>: E e = list.get(list.size() - 1);\n<<<explanation>>>: First get the size of the list, then the last element is at index size - 1.\nQuestion: How to get the last value of an ArrayList: How to get the last value of an ArrayList?\nPlease using this api: List.get.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: List.get\n<<<code>>>: E e = list.get(list.size() - 1);\n<<<explanation>>>: First get the size of the list, then the last element is at index size - 1.\nQuestion: How to get the last value of an ArrayList: How to get the last value of an ArrayList?\nPlease using this api: List.get.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: List.get\n<<<code>>>: E e = list.get(list.size() - 1);\n<<<explanation>>>: First get the size of the list, then the last element is at index size - 1.\nQuestion: How to get the last value of an ArrayList: How to get the last value of an ArrayList?\nPlease using this api: List.get.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: List.get\n<<<code>>>: E e = list.get(list.size() - 1);\n<<<explanation>>>: First get the size of the list, then the last element is at index size - 1.\nQuestion: How to get the last value of an ArrayList: How to get the last value of an ArrayList?\nPlease using this api: List.get.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: List.get\n<<<code>>>: E e = list.get(list.size() - 1);\n<<<explanation>>>: First get the size of the list, then the last element is at index size - 1.\nQuestion: How to get the last value of an ArrayList: How to get the last value of an ArrayList?\nPlease using this api: List.get.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: List.get\n<<<code>>>: E e = list.get(list.size() - 1);\n<<<explanation>>>: First get the size of the list, then the last element is at index size - 1.\nQuestion: How to get the last value of an ArrayList: How to get the last value of an ArrayList?\nPlease using this api: List.get.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: List.get\n<<<code>>>: E e = list.get"}
