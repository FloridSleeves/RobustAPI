But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\n\nYou can use printWriter.println() instead of printWriter.write() to write a string and a line break.\n\nA: You are using PrintWriter.write() method which writes the string as it is. It does not add a newline character at the end. So, when you read the data using BufferedReader, it reads until it finds a newline character. Since your data \"123\" does not have a newline character at the end, it reads all of it as one string.\nYou should use PrintWriter.println() method which writes the string and then adds a newline character.\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\nThis will send each line as \"1\\n\", \"2\\n\", \"3\\n\" to the server. The server will then read each line separately.\n\nA: You should use printWriter.println() instead of printWriter.write(). printWriter.println() will add a newline character at the end of the string, which is what BufferedReader.readLine() is expecting.\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\nThis will send \"1\\n\", \"2\\n\", \"3\\n\" to the server. When you read the data with BufferedReader, it will read each line separately.\n\nA: You are using PrintWriter.write() which does not add a newline character at the end of the string. BufferedReader.readLine() expects a newline character to mark the end of a line. You should use PrintWriter.println() which automatically adds a newline character at the end of the string.\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\nThis will send \"1\\n\", \"2\\n\", \"3\\n\" to the server.
