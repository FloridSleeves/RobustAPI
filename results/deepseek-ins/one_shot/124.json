It contains the data, the length of the data, the IP address of the destination, and the port number of the destination. The DatagramSocket object is used to send the data.\n\nA: The problem is not with the emojis, but with the encoding of the string. The emojis are not being displayed correctly because they are not being interpreted as UTF-8.\nIn your VolleyFileUploadRequest, you are using the getBytes() method which returns the bytes of the string in the platform's default encoding. This is not always UTF-8, especially on Android where the platform's default encoding can vary.\nTo fix this, you should explicitly specify the encoding as UTF-8 when you convert the string to bytes. You can do this by using the getBytes(\"UTF-8\") method instead of getBytes().\nHere is how you can modify your code:\noverride fun getByteData(): MutableMap<String, FileDataPart> {\n    val params = HashMap<String, FileDataPart>()\n    params[\"file\"] = FileDataPart(\n        \"file$rndInt\",\n        getBytes(finalInputSteam!!)!!,\n        \"fffff\"\n    )\n    return params\n}\n\nprivate fun getBytes(input: String): ByteArray? {\n    return input.toByteArray(Charset.forName(\"UTF-8\"))\n}\n\nThis will ensure that the emojis are correctly interpreted and displayed in the string.\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the finalInputSteam is a string that contains the emojis. If it's not, you may need to convert it to a string first.\n\nA: The problem is not with the emojis, but with the encoding of the string.
