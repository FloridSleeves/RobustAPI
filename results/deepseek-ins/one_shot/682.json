The readLine method returns null when there are no more lines to read. You can use a while loop to continue reading until you reach the end of the file.\n\nA: The problem is that you're not sending newline characters (\\n or \\r\\n) between your lines. The BufferedReader reads until it encounters a newline character, so it's reading all the data together.\nYou should use printWriter.println() instead of printWriter.write(). This will automatically add the appropriate newline character for your platform.\nHere's how you can modify your code:\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\nAnd then your BufferedReader will work as expected:\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());  // prints \"1\"\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());  // prints \"2\"\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());  // prints \"3\"\n\n\nA: You are writing the lines without a newline character.
