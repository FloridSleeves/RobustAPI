It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Getting a HTTP POST binary payload to a byte array in Scala: :I have a socket which will persist for long.

This will make your code more efficient and easier to read.\n\nA: The problem is that you're reading one byte at a time, which is very inefficient. Instead, you should read the entire payload in one go.\n\nYou can use the read method of InputStream which reads some number of bytes from the stream into an array.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```java\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1024]; // or any other buffer size you prefer\nint bytesRead;\nwhile ((bytesRead = is.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n    // process bytesRead bytes from buffer\n}\n```\n\nThis will read up to the size of the buffer at a time, and you can process the data directly from the buffer. If you know the size of the payload in advance, you can create the buffer with that size. If you don't know the size, you can use a dynamic buffer, but be aware that this can lead to memory issues if the payload is very large.\n\nAlso, you should handle the case where the read operation returns -1 to indicate that the end of the stream has been reached.\n\nFinally, you should close the InputStream when you're done with it to free up system resources.\n\n```java\nis.close();\n```\n\nThis should significantly improve the performance of your code.\n\nA: You can use the readFully method of the DataInputStream class. This method reads a certain number of bytes from the stream and stores them in a byte array. If the end of the stream is reached before the specified number of bytes are read, an IOException is thrown.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```java\nDataInputStream dis = new DataInputStream(client.getInputStream());\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576]; // assuming 1MB buffer size\ndis.readFully(buffer);\n```\n\nThis will read exactly 1048576 bytes from the stream and store them in the buffer. If the end of the stream is reached before 1048576 bytes are read, an IOException will be thrown.\n\nRemember to close the DataInputStream when you're done with it to free up system resources.\n\n```java\ndis.close();\n```\n\nThis should also significantly improve the performance of your code.\n\nPlease note that the readFully method is available from Java 1.6 onwards. If you're using an older version of Java, you may need to use a loop to read the bytes one by one, similar to your current code.\n\nA: You can use the readFully method of the DataInputStream class.
