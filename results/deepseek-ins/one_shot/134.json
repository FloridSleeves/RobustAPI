Then it will create a file named \"myfile.txt\" inside this directory and write \"Hello World!\" to it.\n\nTo read the file, you can use the following code:\n\n```java\ntry {\n    File file = new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), \"MyDir/myfile.txt\");\n    FileInputStream fIn = new FileInputStream(file);\n    InputStreamReader myInReader = new InputStreamReader(fIn);\n    char[] inputBuffer = new char[(int) file.length()];\n    myInReader.read(inputBuffer);\n    String fileContent = new String(inputBuffer);\n    System.out.println(fileContent);\n    myInReader.close();\n    fIn.close();\n} catch (Exception e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n```\n\nThis code will read the content of the file \"myfile.txt\" and print it to the console.\n\nTo delete the file, you can use the following code:\n\n```java\ntry {\n    File file = new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), \"MyDir/myfile.txt\");\n    file.delete();\n} catch (Exception e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();"}
