But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: java jasper report export to stream blank page: :I use jasper reports version 6.2.1 with the following configuration:HttpServletResponse response = (HttpServletResponse) FacesContext.getCurrentInstance().getExternalContext().getResponse(); JREmptyDataSource jasper = new JREmptyDataSource(); JasperPrint jasperPrint = jasperFillManager.fillReport(this.getClass().getClassLoader().getResource(\"/reports/tn2.jasper\").getPath(), null, jasper);response.setContentType(\"application/pdf\");response.setHeader(\"Content-Disposition\", \"attachment\" + \"; filename=hehe.pdf\");ByteArrayOutputStream finalReport = new ByteArrayOutputStream();JasperExportManager.exportReportToPdfStream(jasperPrint,finalReport);PrintWriter ouputStream = response.getWriter();ouputStream.write(new String(finalReport.toByteArray()));ouputStream.flush();FacesContext.getCurrentInstance().responseComplete();I do it from my JSF 2.x backing bean.But I always get a blank page when try to export to stream.

This will work if you are using a servlet container that supports the HTTP 1.1 specification, which is the case for most of them. However, if you are using a servlet container that supports HTTP 1.0, the response will not be closed after the response has been written. This can cause the browser to hang waiting for the response to be closed. To avoid this, you should use the response.getOutputStream() method instead of response.getWriter().\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true);\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(8000);\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem. That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: try { System.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine()); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are reading only one line from the BufferedReader. The readLine() method reads a line of text. Each line is terminated by any one of a line termination characters: a line feed ('\\n'), a carriage return ('\\r'), or a carriage return followed immediately by a linefeed. In your case, you are sending three lines of text, but the BufferedReader is reading only the first one because it is waiting for a line termination character. To fix this, you should call readLine() in a loop until there are no more lines to read.\n\nA: The problem is that you are writing the lines without a line break. The BufferedReader reads until it finds a line break, which is not present in your case.\nYou should use println() instead of write() to write the lines with a line break.\nHere is the corrected code:\nPrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true);\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\nAnd then read the lines in the server side:\nServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(8000);\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine()); // prints \"1\"\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine()); // prints \"2\"\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine()); // prints \"3\"\n\nThis way, each write will send a new line to the server, and each readLine() will read a new line from the server.\n\nA: The problem is that you are using PrintWriter.write() which does not add a line break. You should use PrintWriter.println() instead which adds a line break.\nSo your code should look like this:\nPrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true);\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\nAnd then you can read the lines in the server side:\nServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(8000);\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine()); // prints \"1\"\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine()); // prints \"2\"\nSystem.out.println(buffered"}
