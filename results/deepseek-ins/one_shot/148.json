It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: How to pipe stream to java program?: :Under cmd.exe, I can do like this:dir *.*|grep ....I want to do this to java programdir *.i|java test What I should do in my java test class?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Android InputStream.read() horribly slow:I'm working on an Android app that needs to communicate with a server (running on my PC) which is also written by me.

This method will block until some input is available, an I/O error occurs, or the end of the stream is reached. The number of bytes read is returned.\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java?: :I have a file in my project directory, how can I read it in Java?\nPlease using this api: FileInputStream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileInputStream\n<<<code>>>: File file = new File(\"your_file_path\");\ntry (FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(file)) {\n    byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\n    int length;\n    while ((length = fis.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n        // do something with buffer\n    }\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: Use FileInputStream to read from a file in Java. It's a subclass of InputStream and is used to read data from a file. The read() method reads the next byte of data from the file and returns it as an integer in the range 0 to 255. If it reaches the end of the file, it returns -1.\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java line by line?: :I have a file in my project directory, how can I read it in Java line by line?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader\n<<<code>>>: File file = new File(\"your_file_path\");\ntry (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file))) {\n    String line;\n    while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n        // do something with line\n    }\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: Use BufferedReader to read from a file in Java line by line. It's a class in java.io package that wraps an existing Reader, such as FileReader, to buffer characters so that it can read them one at a time. The readLine() method reads a line of text. It returns null when there is no more data to read.\nQuestion: How to write to a file in Java?: :I have a file in my project directory, how can I write to it in Java?\nPlease using this api: FileOutputStream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileOutputStream\n<<<code>>>: File file = new File(\"your_file_path\");\ntry (FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(file)) {\n    String data = \"Some data to write\";\n    fos.write(data.getBytes());\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: Use FileOutputStream to write to a file in Java. It's a subclass of OutputStream and is used to write data to a file. The write() method writes the specified byte to the file.\nQuestion: How to append to a file in Java?: :I have a file in my project directory, how can I append to it in Java?\nPlease using this api: FileOutputStream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileOutputStream\n<<<code>>>: File file = new File(\"your_file_path\");\ntry (FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(file, true)) {\n    String data = \"Some data to append\";\n    fos.write(data.getBytes());\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: Use FileOutputStream with true as the second argument to append to a file in Java. It's a subclass of OutputStream and is used to write data to a file. The write() method writes the specified byte to the file.\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java line by line using BufferedReader?: :I have a file in my project directory, how can I read it in Java line by line using BufferedReader?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.\nAnswer:"}
