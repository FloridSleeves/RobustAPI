It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: String base64 decoded un-gziped from little-endian 4-byte int to java int: :I'm trying to implement TMX files in Android and I was hoping someone could help. Based on the TMX guide, in order to get the GID's I have to first base64 decode the string, then gunzip the resulting data if the compression attribute is set to \"gzip\" as in the above example. Finally, you can read 4 bytes at a time for each GID from the beginning of the data stream until the end.I think I've figured out the base64 decoding and 'gunzip' but the result from the code below is 27,0,0,0 repeating. I think the output is supposed to be (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) Thanks! public static void main( String[] args ) { String myString = \"H4sIAAAAAAAAAO3NoREAMAgEsLedAfafE4+s6l0jolNJiif18tt/Fj8AAMC9ARtYg28AEAAA\"; byte[] decode = Base64.decodeBase64(myString); ByteArrayInputStream byteArrayInputStream = new ByteArrayInputStream(decode);  GZIPInputStream gzipInputStream; int read; try {      gzipInputStream = new GZIPInputStream(byteArrayInputStream);      InputStreamReader inputStreamReader = new InputStreamReader(gzipInputStream);      BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(inputStreamReader, 4);      while ( ( read = bufferedReader.read() ) != -1 )      {           System.out.println(\"read :\" + read);      } } catch (IOException e) {      e.printStackTrace(); } }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Android InputStream.read() horribly slow:I'm working on an Android app that needs to communicate with a server (running on my PC) which is also written by me.

You need to convert it to a Java int. You can do this by bitwise and with 0xFF to ensure you get the correct byte value and then shift the bytes to the correct position.\nQuestion: How to get the IP address of the device in Android:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InetAddress.getHostAddress()\n<<<code>>>: try {\n    InetAddress ipAddr = InetAddress.getByName(InetAddress.getHostName());\n    String ip = ipAddr.getHostAddress();\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You can use the InetAddress class to get the IP address of the device. getHostName() gets the host name of the device and getByName() gets the InetAddress of that host. getHostAddress() gets the IP address of that InetAddress.\nQuestion: How to get the MAC address of the device in Android:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: NetworkInterface.getHardwareAddress()\n<<<code>>>: try {\n    for (NetworkInterface intf : Collections.list(NetworkInterface.getNetworkInterfaces())) {\n        byte[] mac = intf.getHardwareAddress();\n        if (mac != null) {\n            StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n            for (int i = 0; i < mac.length; i++) {\n                sb.append(String.format(\"%02X%s\", mac[i], (i < mac.length - 1) ? \"-\" : \"\"));\n            }\n            String macAddress = sb.toString();\n            System.out.println(macAddress);\n        }\n    }\n} catch (SocketException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You can use the NetworkInterface class to get the MAC address of the device. getHardwareAddress() gets the hardware address of the network interface. You need to loop through all network interfaces to get the MAC address of all network interfaces.\nQuestion: How to get the device's unique ID in Android:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Settings.Secure.getString(getContentResolver(), Settings.Secure.ANDROID_ID)\n<<<code>>>: String uniqueID = Settings.Secure.getString(getContentResolver(), Settings.Secure.ANDROID_ID);\n<<<explanation>>>: The ANDROID_ID constant in the Settings.Secure class returns a 64-bit number (as a hex string) that is unique per device. It is generated when the device is first set up and should remain constant for the lifetime of the device.\nQuestion: How to get the device's model in Android:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Build.MODEL\n<<<code>>>: String model = Build.MODEL;\n<<<explanation>>>: The Build.MODEL constant in the Build class returns the model of the device. This is the name of the product, such as \"Nexus 7\" or \"GT-I9100\".\nQuestion: How to get the device's manufacturer in Android:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Build.MANUFACTURER\n<<<code>>>: String manufacturer = Build.MANUFACTURER;\n<<<explanation>>>: The Build.MANUFACTURER constant in the Build class returns the manufacturer of the device. This is the name of the device's hardware manufacturer, such as \"Samsung\" or \"HTC\".\nQuestion: How to get the device's version in Android"}
