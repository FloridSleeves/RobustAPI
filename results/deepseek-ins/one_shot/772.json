So far, there haven't been any errors with accessing it. However, when I close the program or after when the files should have been written when I open the text file I don't find them there, however I did check the bin folder ocne and it seemed to print hello world to the temp copy there. I want the changes it makes to be permanent.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem.

This is what you need to ensure that your changes are saved permanently.\n\nA: The issue is that you are not writing a line terminator after each line. In the PrintWriter.write method, you are only writing the characters \"1\", \"2\", and \"3\" without a line terminator. The BufferedReader.readLine method waits for a line terminator (which is '\\n' or '\\r\\n' depending on the system) to read a line. Since you are not providing one, it reads until it encounters the end of the stream.\nYou should use PrintWriter.println instead of PrintWriter.write to write each line followed by a line terminator.\nHere is the corrected code:\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\n\nA: The issue is that you are not writing a line terminator after each line.
