I am using AsyncTask to perform network operations. I want to display a progress dialog while the AsyncTask is running and dismiss it when the AsyncTask is completed. I have tried the following code but it's not working:\nProgressDialog progressDialog;\n\n@Override\nprotected void onPreExecute() {\n    progressDialog = ProgressDialog.show(MainActivity.this, \"Please wait\", \"Loading...\", true);\n}\n\n@Override\nprotected void onPostExecute(String result) {\n    progressDialog.dismiss();\n}\n\nI have also tried dismissing the progress dialog in onCancelled() method but it's not working either. What am I doing wrong?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: ProgressDialog.dismiss\n<<<code>>>: progressDialog.dismiss();\n<<<explanation>>>: You need to dismiss the progress dialog in onPostExecute() method. This method is called when doInBackground() method finishes its execution. If you dismiss the progress dialog in onCancelled() method, it will dismiss the dialog even if the AsyncTask is cancelled.\nQuestion: I am trying to display a progress dialog while a network operation is being performed. I have a method that performs the network operation and returns a string. I want to display the progress dialog while this method is being executed and dismiss it when the operation is completed. How can I achieve this?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: ProgressDialog.show\n<<<code>>>: ProgressDialog progressDialog = ProgressDialog.show(MainActivity.this, \"Please wait\", \"Loading...\", true);\n<<<explanation>>>: You need to show the progress dialog in onPreExecute() method. This method is called before doInBackground() method is executed.\n\nAnd for dismissing the progress dialog in onPostExecute() method. This method is called when doInBackground() method finishes its execution.\n\nHere is an example of how you can use AsyncTask:\n\n```java\nprivate class NetworkOperation extends AsyncTask<Void, Void, String> {\n\n    ProgressDialog progressDialog;\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onPreExecute() {\n        progressDialog = ProgressDialog.show(MainActivity.this, \"Please wait\", \"Loading...\", true);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected String doInBackground(Void... params) {\n        // Perform network operation here\n        // Return the result\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onPostExecute(String result) {\n        progressDialog.dismiss();\n        // Handle the result\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou can start the AsyncTask like this:\n\n```java\nnew NetworkOperation().execute();\n```\n\nThis will display the progress dialog while the network operation is being performed and dismiss it when the operation is completed.\n\nPlease note that you should not perform network operations on the main thread. If you need to perform network operations, you should use AsyncTask or a similar mechanism to perform them in the background.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>"}
