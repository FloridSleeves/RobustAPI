When you want to send a message to a specific client, you can use the corresponding DataOutputStream to send the message. This way, you can send a message to client#1 without sending it to client#2 or client#3.\n\n\nA: The problem is likely due to the encoding of the text. The emojis are not being encoded correctly, which is why they appear as strange characters.\nYou can try to encode the text in UTF-8 before sending it. This should ensure that the emojis are correctly encoded and displayed on the other side.\nHere is how you can modify your code:\n```kotlin\noverride fun getByteData(): MutableMap<String, FileDataPart> {\n    val params = HashMap<String, FileDataPart>()\n    params[\"file\"] = FileDataPart(\n        \"file$rndInt\",\n        getBytes(finalInputSteam!!)!!,\n        \"fffff\"\n    )\n    return params\n}\n\noverride fun getParams(): MutableMap<String, String> {\n    val params = HashMap<String, String>()\n    params[\"text\"] = \"Your text here\".encodeToByteArray().toString(Charsets.UTF_8)\n    return params\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, the text is encoded to UTF-8 before being sent. The `encodeToByteArray()` function converts the text to a byte array, and the `toString(Charsets.UTF_8)` function converts the byte array to a string.\n\nPlease replace \"Your text here\" with your actual text.\n\nThis should solve the problem with emojis not being displayed correctly.\n\nRegarding your second question, you can maintain a list of DataOutputStreams for each client. When you want to send a message to a specific client, you can use the corresponding DataOutputStream to send the message. This way, you can send a message to client#1 without sending it to client#2 or client#3.\n\nHere is an example of how you can do this:\n\n```kotlin\n// List of DataOutputStreams for each client\nval client1OutputStream: DataOutputStream\nval client2OutputStream: DataOutputStream\nval client3OutputStream: DataOutputStream\n\n// When you want to send a message to client#1\nsendMessageToClient(client1OutputStream, \"Your message here\")\n\n// Function to send a message to a specific client\nfun sendMessageToClient(dataOutputStream: DataOutputStream, message: String) {\n    dataOutputStream.writeBytes(message + lineEnd)\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, the `sendMessageToClient()` function sends a message to a specific client by using the corresponding DataOutputStream. The message is sent by calling the `writeBytes()` function on the DataOutputStream.\n\nPlease replace \"Your message here\" with your actual message.\n\nThis should allow you to send a message to client#1 without sending it to client#2 or client#3.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n"}
