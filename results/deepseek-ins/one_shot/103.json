This ensures that the file will always use the linux eol char LF.\n\nA: The issue is not with Volley but with how you're sending the data. Volley itself doesn't handle encoding issues, it's more about how you're sending the data.\nIn your case, you're sending the data using DataOutputStream.writeBytes() which uses the platform's default charset. This can cause issues with emojis, as the default charset on many platforms (including Android) doesn't support emojis.\nYou should use DataOutputStream.write(byte[] b, int off, int len) instead, which allows you to specify the charset. You can use \"UTF-8\" which supports all Unicode characters including emojis.\nHere's how you can modify your function:\nprivate void buildTextPart(DataOutputStream dataOutputStream, String parameterName, String parameterValue) throws IOException {\n    dataOutputStream.writeBytes(twoHyphens + boundary + lineEnd);\n    dataOutputStream.writeBytes(\"Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\" + parameterName + lineEnd);\n    dataOutputStream.writeBytes(\"Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\" + lineEnd);\n    dataOutputStream.writeBytes(lineEnd);\n\n    byte[] bytes = parameterValue.getBytes(\"UTF-8\");\n    dataOutputStream.write(bytes, 0, bytes.length);\n    dataOutputStream.writeBytes(lineEnd);\n}\n\nThis should ensure that the emojis are sent correctly.\nAs for the second question, you can use the replace() function to replace all occurrences of CR+LF with LF. Here's how you can do it:\nString linuxFileContent = windowsFileContent.replace(\"\\r\\n\", \"\\n\");\n\nThis will replace all occurrences of Windows-style line endings (CR+LF) with Unix-style line endings (LF), ensuring that the file will always use the Linux EOL char LF.\n\nA: The issue is not with Volley but with how you're sending the data.
