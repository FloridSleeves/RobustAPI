But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\n\nA: The issue is that you are not sending a line break after each write. In your case, you are sending \"1\", \"2\", and \"3\" without any line breaks. The BufferedReader.readLine() method reads until it encounters a line terminator, which is not provided in your case.\nYou can fix this by adding a line break after each write:\nprintWriter.write(\"1\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\\n\");\n\nAlternatively, you can use println() which automatically adds a line break:\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\nBoth of these will ensure that each number is on its own line when read by the BufferedReader.\n\nA: You are writing the strings without a line break.

It stops when it encounters a line terminator, which is a newline ('\\n'), a carriage return ('\\r'), or a carriage return followed immediately by a newline.\nIn your case, you are writing \"1\", \""}
