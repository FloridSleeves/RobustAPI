But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: decode large base64 from xml in java: OutOfMemory: :I need to write a base64 encoded element of an xml file into a separate file. Problem: the file could easily reach the size of 100 MB. Every solution I tried ended with the \"java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space\". The problem is not reading the xml in general or the decoding process, but the size of the base64 block.I used jdom, dom4j and XMLStreamReader to access the xml file. However, as soon as I want to access the base64 content of the respective element I get the mentioned error. I also tried an xslt using saxon's base64Binary-to-octets function, but of course with the same result.Is there a way to stream this base64 encoded part into a file without getting the whole chunk in one single piece?Thanks for your hints,Andreas\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem.

To fix this, you should add a line break character (\"\\n\") after each write.\n\n\nA: You need to flush the PrintWriter after each write.
