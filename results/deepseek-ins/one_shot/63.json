The read method will return the number of bytes read, which can be less than the length of the buffer if there are no more bytes to read.\n\nIn your code, you are reading into a buffer of size 128/8 bytes (which is 16 bytes), but you are not checking the return value of the read method to see how many bytes were actually read. If the return value is less than 16, you are assuming that all the data is available, which may not be the case.\n\nHere is a corrected version of your code:\npublic void loadKey(File in, byte[] privateKey) throws GeneralSecurityException, IOException {\n    PKCS8EncodedKeySpec privateKeySpec = new PKCS8EncodedKeySpec(privateKey);\n    KeyFactory kf = KeyFactory.getInstance(\"RSA\");\n    PrivateKey pk = kf.generatePrivate(privateKeySpec);\n    rsacipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE,"}
