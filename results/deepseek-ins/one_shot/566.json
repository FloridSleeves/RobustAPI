So I wondered if ImageIO could detect the end of an image. (I have absolutely no knowledge of the JPEG format, so I tested it instead)Apparently, not.On the server side, I sent images continuously by using ImageIO.write(...) in loop with some sleeping in between. On the client side, ImageIO read the first image no problem, but on the next one it returned null. This is confusing. I was expecting it to either block on reading the first image (because it thinks the next image is still part of the same image), or succeed at reading all of them (because it works). What is going on? It looks like ImageIO detects the end of the first image, but not the second one. (The images, by the way, are similar to each other roughly) Is there an easy way to stream images like this or do I have to make my own mechanism that reads the bytes into a buffer until it reaches a specified byte or sequence of bytes, at which point it reads the image out of the buffer?This is the useful part of my server code:        while(true){            Socket sock=s.accept();            System.out.println(\"Connection\");            OutputStream out=sock.getOutputStream();            while(!socket.isClosed()){                BufferedImage img=//get image                ImageIO.write(img, \"jpg\", out);                Thread.sleep(100);            }            System.out.println(\"Closed\");        }And my client code:        Socket s=new Socket(InetAddress.getByName(\"localhost\"), 1998);        InputStream in=s.getInputStream();        while(!s.isClosed()){            BufferedImage img=ImageIO.read(in);            if(img==null)//this is what happens on the SECOND image            else // do something useful with the image        }\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Iterator.next is not working:im tring to get all value for all children from firebase database but when i run this code below i only get the first child value multi times.names=new ArrayList<>();\n        rootRef.addValueEventListener(new ValueEventListener() {\n                    @Override\n                                public void onDataChange(DataSnapshot dataSnapshot) {\n\n                                                for (DataSnapshot dataSnapshot1:dataSnapshot.getChildren()) {\n                                                                    i = i + 1;\n                                                                                        names.add(dataSnapshot.getChildren().iterator().next().getValue(String.class));\n                                                                                                        \n                                                }\n                                                                Toast.makeText(signup.this,\"\"+names,Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();\n\n                                                                            \n                                }\n\n                                            @Override\n                                                        public void onCancelled(DatabaseError databaseError) {\n\n                                                                            \n                                                                }\n                                                                \n        });can i cange the Iterator to a list? i want the simplest way to do it\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: for(Iterator<DataSnapshot> it = dataSnapshot.getChildren().iterator(); it.hasNext(); ){\n  i = i + 1;\n    names.add(it.next().getValue(String.class));\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You're creating a new dataSnapshot.getChildren().iterator() in every iteration of your loop.

Try to just use the value of the foreach inside the loop.\n\nA: The problem is that you're calling dataSnapshot.getChildren().iterator().next() in each iteration of your loop. This means that you're always getting the first child of the dataSnapshot, regardless of which iteration you're on.\nInstead, you should use the iterator you've created in the loop to get each child of the dataSnapshot.
