But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\n\nYou should use printWriter.println() instead of printWriter.write(). println() automatically appends a line separator to the output.\n\nA: You are writing the data without a line separator. BufferedReader reads until it finds a line separator. In your case, it is not finding one because you are writing all the data in one go.\nYou should use printWriter.println() instead of printWriter.write(). println() automatically appends a line separator to the output.\nSo, your code should look like this:\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\nAnd then you can read the data line by line:\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine()); // prints 1\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine()); // prints 2\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine()); // prints 3\n\nThis way, you will get each line separately.\n\nA: You are writing the data without a line separator.
