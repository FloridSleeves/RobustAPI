Thank you =)\nPlease using this api: SQLiteDatabase.query.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: SQLiteDatabase.close\n<<<code>>>: db.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: You should always close your database connections when you're done with them. This helps to free up system resources. It's a good practice to close your database connections in the onDestroy() method of your Activity.\n\nQuestion: How to use SQLiteDatabase.insert() method in Android?:\n\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: SQLiteDatabase.insert()\n<<<code>>>: db.insert(\"MyTable\", null, values);\n<<<explanation>>>: The insert() method takes three parameters: the name of the table, a ContentValues object containing the values to insert, and an optional selection to match. If you don't need a selection, you can pass null.\n\nQuestion: How to use SQLiteDatabase.update() method in Android?:\n\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: SQLiteDatabase.update()\n<<<code>>>: db.update(\"MyTable\", values, \"col1 = ?\", new String[] { \"something\" });\n<<<explanation>>>: The update() method takes four parameters: the name of the table, a ContentValues object containing the new values, the where clause, and an optional array of selection arguments.\n\nQuestion: How to use SQLiteDatabase.delete() method in Android?:\n\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: SQLiteDatabase.delete()\n<<<code>>>: db.delete(\"MyTable\", \"col1 = ?\", new String[] { \"something\" });\n<<<explanation>>>: The delete() method takes three parameters: the name of the table, the where clause, and an optional array of selection arguments.\n\nQuestion: How to use SQLiteDatabase.execSQL() method in Android?:\n\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: SQLiteDatabase.execSQL()\n<<<code>>>: db.execSQL(\"CREATE TABLE MyTable (col1 int, col2 text)\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The execSQL() method is used to execute a single SQL statement that is not expected to return any results, such as an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement.\n\nQuestion: How to use SQLiteDatabase.rawQuery() method in Android?:\n\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: SQLiteDatabase.rawQuery()\n<<<code>>>: Cursor c = db.rawQuery(\"SELECT * FROM MyTable WHERE col1 = ?\", new String[] { \"something\" });\n<<<explanation>>>: The rawQuery() method is used to execute a query that returns a Cursor. The query is passed as a string, and the selection arguments are passed as an array of Strings.\n\nQuestion: How to use SQLiteDatabase.beginTransaction() and SQLiteDatabase.setTransactionSuccessful() methods in Android?:\n\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: SQLiteDatabase.beginTransaction(), SQLiteDatabase.setTransactionSuccessful()\n<<<code>>>: db.beginTransaction();\ntry {\n    db.insert(\"MyTable1\", null, values1);\n    db.insert(\"MyTable2\", null, values2);\n    db.setTransactionSuccessful();\n} finally {\n    db.endTransaction();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The beginTransaction() method starts a new transaction. The setTransactionSuccessful() method marks the current transaction as successful, and the endTransaction() method ends the transaction. If the transaction is not successful, the changes will be rolled back.\n\nQuestion: How to use SQLiteDatabase.beginTransactionNonExclusive() and SQLiteDatabase.setTransactionSuccessful() methods in Android?:\n\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: SQLiteDatabase.beginTransactionNonExclusive(), SQLiteDatabase.setTransactionSuccessful()\n<<<code>>>: db.beginTransactionNonExclusive();\ntry {\n    db.insert(\"MyTable1\", null, values1);\n    db.insert(\"MyTable2\", null, values2);\n    db.setTransactionSuccessful();\n} finally {\n    db.endTransaction();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The beginTransactionNonExclusive() method starts a new transaction that does not lock the database. The setTransactionSuccessful() method marks the current transaction as successful, and the endTransaction() method ends the transaction. If the transaction is not successful, the changes will be rolled back.\n\nQuestion: How to use SQLiteDatabase.inTransaction() method in Android?:\n\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: SQLiteDatabase.inTransaction()\n<<<"}
