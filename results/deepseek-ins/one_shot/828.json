If the input is not an integer, an InputMismatchException is thrown and caught, and the error message is written to the error.txt file. If the input is an integer, it is written to the output.txt file. If the input file does not exist, a FileNotFoundException is thrown and caught.\n\nA: The problem is that you are not sending a line break after each write. In your case, you are sending \"1\", \"2\", and \"3\" without a line break, so when you read the input with a BufferedReader, it reads all of the characters as a single line.\nTo fix this, you should add a line break after each write:\nprintWriter.write(\"1\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\\n\");\n\nThis tells the BufferedReader to consider the end of the line after each write, so it will read each one as a separate line.\n\nA: The problem is that you are not sending a line break after each write.
