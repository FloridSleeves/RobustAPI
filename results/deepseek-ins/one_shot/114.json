When you call `outputStream.write(username.getText().getBytes());` and `outputStream.write(password.getText().getBytes());`, you are writing the bytes of both strings to the output stream without any delimiter. This means that when you read the input stream on the server side, you are reading the entire content of the input stream as a single string, which explains why you are getting \"usernamepassword\" as your output.\n\nTo solve this, you need to add a delimiter between the two strings. This delimiter can be any character or sequence of characters that you know will not appear in your actual data. For example, you could use a special character like \"|\" or a specific string like \"END_OF_USERNAME\". Then, on the server side, you would read the input stream until you encounter this delimiter, and then continue reading the rest of the input stream as the password.\n\nHere is an example of how you could modify your code:\n\nClient.java:\n```java\noutputStream.write(username.getText().getBytes());\noutputStream.write(\"|\".getBytes()); // Add a delimiter\noutputStream.write(password.getText().getBytes());\n```\n\nServer.java:\n```java\nbyte[] username = new byte[20];\nint bytesRead = inputStream.read(username);\nString user = new String(username, 0, bytesRead);\n\n// Find the delimiter\nint delimiterIndex = user.indexOf(\"|\");\n\n// If the delimiter is found, split the string\nif (delimiterIndex != -1) {\n    String usr = user.substring(0, delimiterIndex);\n    String pass = user.substring(delimiterIndex + 1);\n    System.out.println(\"username = \" + usr);\n    System.out.println(\"password = \" + pass);\n} else {\n    System.out.println(\"No delimiter found\");\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the delimiter \"|\" is used to separate the username and password. You can replace it with any character or sequence of characters that you know will not appear in your actual data.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n"}
