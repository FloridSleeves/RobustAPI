I understand the process of id generation is automated, which gets added to R.java For instance, if we have same IDs, say \"image1\" in two XMLs, say \"layout1\" & \"layout2\". but in R.java it won't have 2 IDs. that means at a time it will reference only 1 component.

It will run in the same thread as the UI thread. The Handler will not block the UI thread. It will post the Runnable to the message queue of the UI thread and execute it when the UI thread is ready.\nQuestion: Timer-task VS handler VS alarm-manager:\nAnswer: Timer-task: It is a legacy API that is not recommended for new development. It is not accurate for scheduling tasks and can cause battery drain. It is also not thread-safe.\nHandler: It is a more modern and recommended API for scheduling tasks. It is accurate and does not cause battery drain. It is thread-safe and can be used in any thread. It is also more efficient than Timer-task.\nAlarm-manager: It is a system-level API that is used for scheduling tasks at specific times. It is not recommended for frequent tasks as it can drain battery. It is used for tasks that need to be done at specific times, not for recurring tasks.\n\nA: \nwhy doesn't it give error just like we get in java code?\n\nThis is because in Android, the ids are not unique per se, but are unique within a single resource file (like R.java). When you inflate a layout, the ids in that layout are compared with the ids in the current view hierarchy. If there is a conflict, the inflate() method throws an exception.\n\nhow does environment decide to which component it needs to invoke?\n\nThe environment uses the ids to decide which component to invoke. When you call findViewById(), you are asking the environment to find a view with a specific id in the current view hierarchy. The environment uses the ids that were assigned in the XML layout files to match the ids you pass to findViewById() with the ids in the current view hierarchy.\n\nIn case we have to use 2 XMLs in an Activity, one as activity.setcontentview(layout1) and another as a PopupWindow.setContentView(layout2). What will happen in such case?\n\nIf you call setContentView() with a new layout, the new layout will replace the old one. The old layout will be destroyed along with its views. The new layout will be inflated and its views will be added to the view hierarchy. The ids in the new layout will be compared with the ids in the current view hierarchy. If there is a conflict, an exception will be thrown.\n\nwill it overlap ?\n\nNo, it will not overlap. The Handler will not overlap. It will run in the same thread as the UI thread. The Handler will not block the UI thread. It will post the Runnable to the message queue of the UI thread and execute it when the UI thread is ready.\n\nTimer-task VS handler VS alarm-manager:\n\nTimer-task: It is a legacy API that is not recommended for new development.
