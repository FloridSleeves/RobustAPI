It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: make a client server java application: :I am trying to make a Java application in a client/server way.The client is a GUI in SWT which displays data from the server.

I just want something simple in plain Java. But the concept of proxies seems pretty cool.Do you have ideas or examples of such thing?

The read method returns the number of bytes read, which you can use to handle the data in the buffer.\nQuestion: How to handle the data in the buffer?\nAnswer: The data in the buffer is already in the format you read it from the InputStream. If you know the format of the data you are receiving, you can handle it accordingly. For example, if you are receiving text data, you can convert the byte array to a String using the String constructor that takes a byte array and a charset. If you are receiving binary data, you can process it as is.\n\nPlease note that the above answers are based on the assumption that you are using TCP/IP for communication. If you are using a different protocol, the approach might be different.\n\nA: You can use a BufferedInputStream to improve the performance of your InputStream.read() method.\nBufferedInputStream is a wrapper class for another input stream (the underlying input stream) that buffers the input data. It can reduce the number of I/O operations by reading more data into the buffer than is required for a single read operation.\nHere is an example:\nBufferedInputStream bis = new BufferedInputStream(client.getInputStream());\nint b;\nwhile((b = bis.read()) != -1) {\n    // process byte b\n}\n\nAlso, you can use the read(byte[] b) method of InputStream, which reads some number of bytes from the input stream and stores them in the buffer array b.\nHere is an example:\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\nint bytesRead;\nwhile((bytesRead = is.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n    // process bytes in buffer\n}\n\nThese methods will significantly improve the performance of your InputStream.read() method.\n\nA: You can use DataInputStream to read primitive types from the stream. It's more efficient than reading byte by byte.\nDataInputStream dis = new DataInputStream(client.getInputStream());\nint length = dis.readInt();\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[length];\ndis.readFully(buffer);\n\nThis will read an int (4 bytes) to get the length of the data, and then read exactly that many bytes into the buffer.\n\nA: You can use a BufferedInputStream to improve the performance of your InputStream.read() method.\nBufferedInputStream is a wrapper class for another input stream (the underlying input stream) that buffers the input data.
