But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters (like \"\\n\", \"\\r\", \"\\r\\n\"). You are not providing it.\nYou can solve this by adding a line break after each write:\nprintWriter.write(\"1\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\\n\");\n\nOr you can use println method which automatically adds a line break:\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\n\nA: The problem is that you are writing the string without a line break.
