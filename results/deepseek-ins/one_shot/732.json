But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing.

Each score needs to be written to the file \"scores.txt,\" but after I enter my 10 scores, the program doesn't do anything, and the scores are not being written to the file. Basically, I'm not sure how to use processFile to show the mean score. The final program should prompt the user for several scores, write the scores to a file, then open that file, calculate the mean, and display it.

The BufferedReader reads until it encounters a newline character, so it reads all the numbers as a single line.\nYou can fix this by adding a newline character after each number:\nprintWriter.write(\"1\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\\n\");\n\nOr you can use println, which automatically adds a newline character:\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\nThen when you read the lines, you should get each number on a separate line:\nString line;\nwhile ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) {\n    System"}
