'myImage' is the ImageView found by its id. I have already set the permissions in the manifest. The thing is, the image dosen't get saved and it says that the path dosen't exist.

If the directory already exists, this method will do nothing.\nAlso, note that you should use Toast.LENGTH_LONG instead of 7000 and 8000, because these are not valid parameters for the duration.\n\nA: You can use the following code to create a directory if it does not exist:\nFile dir = new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() + \"/AVP_saved\");\nif (!dir.exists()) {\n    dir.mkdirs();\n}\n\nThis code will create a directory named \"AVP_saved\" in the root of your external storage (usually /sdcard). If the directory already exists, this method will do nothing.\n\nA: You should use Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() instead of \"/sdcard\".\nAlso, you should check if the directory was created successfully.\nHere is the corrected code:\npublic void save(View view) {\n"}
