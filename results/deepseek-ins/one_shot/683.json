The PrintWriter's println method automatically adds a line break at the end of each line.\n\nQuestion: How to read a hashtable from a text file in java?:\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nHashtable<String, String> hashtable = new Hashtable<String, String>();\ntry {\n    BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"filename.txt\"));\n    String line;\n    while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {\n        String[] keyValue = line.split(\"=\");\n        hashtable.put(keyValue[0], keyValue[1]);\n    }\n    reader.close();\n} catch (Exception e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: You can read each line of the file using BufferedReader's readLine method, and then split each line into a key and a value using the split method. The key-value pairs are then added to the hashtable.\n\nQuestion: How to read a file in java?:\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\ntry {\n    BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"filename.txt\"));\n    String line;\n    while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {\n        System.out.println(line);\n    }\n    reader.close();\n} catch (Exception e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: You can read each line of the file using BufferedReader's readLine method. The loop continues until the end of the file, and each line is printed to the console.\n\nQuestion: How to write a file in java?:\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\ntry {\n    PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"filename.txt\", \"UTF-8\");\n    writer.println(\"Hello, world!\");\n    writer.close();\n} catch (Exception e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: You can write to a file using a PrintWriter. In this example, the string \"Hello, world!\" is written to the file. The PrintWriter's println method automatically adds a line break at the end of each line.\n\nQuestion: How to read a file line by line in java?:\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\ntry {\n    BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"filename.txt\"));\n    String line;\n    while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {\n        System.out.println(line);\n    }\n    reader.close();\n} catch (Exception e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: You can read each line of the file using BufferedReader's readLine method.
