And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\n\n\nA: You're reading the bytes one by one, which is very inefficient. You should read the bytes into a byte array and then convert them to a string.\nHere is an example:\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint readBytes = is.read(buffer);\nString str = new String(buffer, 0, readBytes, \"UTF-8\");\n\nThis will read all the bytes from the input stream into the buffer, then convert the buffer to a string using UTF-8 encoding.\nAlso, you should check the return value of is.read() to make sure it's not -1 before you use the readBytes variable.\n\nA: You can use DataInputStream to read the length of the string first, then read the string itself.\nHere is an example:\nDataInputStream dis = new DataInputStream(client.getInputStream());\nint len = dis.readInt();\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[len];\ndis.readFully(buffer);\nString str = new String(buffer, \"UTF-8\");\n\nOn the server side, you can send the length of the string first, then send the string itself.\nHere is an example:\nString str = \"Your string here\";\nbyte[] buffer = str.getBytes(\"UTF-8\");\nDataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(client.getOutputStream());\ndos.writeInt(buffer.length);\ndos.write(buffer);\n\nThis way, you can read and write strings in a more efficient way.\n\nA: You can use DataInputStream to read the length of the string first, then read the string itself.\nHere is an example:\nDataInputStream dis = new DataInputStream(client.getInputStream());\nint len = dis.readInt();\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[len];\ndis"}
