You can pass a PrintWriter to it to write the stack trace to a file.\n\n\nA: The problem is that you're writing to the PrintWriter without a newline character. The BufferedReader reads until it encounters a newline character, so it's reading all the data you've written to the PrintWriter without waiting for a newline.\nYou can fix this by adding a newline character after each write:\nprintWriter.write(\"1\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\\n\");\n\nAlternatively, you can use println instead of write:\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\nBoth of these will ensure that each line is read separately by the BufferedReader.\n\nA: The problem is that you're writing to the PrintWriter without a newline character.
