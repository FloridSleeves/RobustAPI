But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: How to create a txt file in Java?: :I'm just want a program to register a user and then create a txt file to store there the information. I know it has to be with createNewFile method but I do not know how to use it.

You can then write to the file using a PrintWriter. The PrintWriter.println method is used to write a line to the file.\n\n\nA: The problem is that you are using PrintWriter.write() which writes a string to the stream. It does not add a newline character. You need to use PrintWriter.println() which writes a line to the stream followed by a newline character.\nHere is how you can modify your code:\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\nAnd then you can read it with BufferedReader:\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\n\nThis will print 1 because readLine() reads a line from the stream.\n\nA: The problem is that you are using PrintWriter.write() which writes a string to the stream.
