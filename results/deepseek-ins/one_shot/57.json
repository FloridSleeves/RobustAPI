The content is appended to the StringBuilder line by line, separated by a newline character. The resulting String can be displayed in a TextView.\n\nA: You can use BufferedReader.readLine() in a loop until it returns null, which means there are no more lines to read. Here is an example:\npublic static List<String> getLinesFromConsole() {\n    List<String> lines = new ArrayList<>();\n    try {\n        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\n        String line;\n        while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n            lines.add(line);\n        }\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    }\n    return lines;\n}\n\nThis will read lines from the console until the user enters an empty line (just presses Enter without typing anything), at which point readLine() will return null.\n\nA: You can use Scanner class to read lines from the console. It will continue to read until it encounters an end of stream.\nHere is an example:\npublic static List<String> getLinesFromConsole() {\n    List<String> lines = new ArrayList<>();\n    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in)) {\n        while (scanner.hasNextLine()) {\n            lines.add(scanner.nextLine());\n        }\n    }\n    return lines;\n}\n\nThis code will read lines from the console until there are no more lines to read. The lines are added to a list which is then returned.\n\nA: You can use Scanner class to read lines from the console.
