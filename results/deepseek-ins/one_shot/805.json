How do I create a new text file (if not existing already), how do I write to it and how do I read from it?

How do I create a new text file (if not existing already), how do I write to it and how do I read from it? Tried to learn it by myself but I've seen so many ways on the Internet and got confused.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: File\n<<<code>>>: \nFile file = new File(\"db.txt\");\nif (!file.exists()) {\n    try {\n        file.createNewFile();\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    }\n}\ntry (PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(file)) {\n    pw.println(\"your string\");\n} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: To create a new file if it doesn't exist, you can use the File class in Java. You can check if the file exists with the exists() method. If it doesn't, you can create a new file with the createNewFile() method. Then, you can write to the file using a PrintWriter.\nTo read from the file, you can use a BufferedReader. Here is an example:\n```java\ntry (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"db.txt\"))) {\n    String line;\n    while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n        System.out.println(line);\n    }\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n```\nThis will read each line of the file and print it to the console.\n\nPlease using this api: File, PrintWriter, BufferedReader, FileReader.\n\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: File, PrintWriter, BufferedReader, FileReader\n<<<code>>>: \nFile file = new File(\"db.txt\");\ntry {\n    if (file.createNewFile()) {\n        System.out.println(\"File created\");\n    } else {\n        System.out.println(\"File already exists\");\n    }\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n\ntry (PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(file)) {\n    pw.println(\"Hello\");\n    pw.println(\"World\");\n} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n\ntry (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file))) {\n    String line;\n    while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n        System.out.println(line);\n    }\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The File class in Java is used to represent a file or a directory in the file system. You can use the createNewFile() method of the File class to create a new file. If the file does not exist, the method creates a new file and returns true. If the file already exists, the method does not change the file and returns false.\n\nThe PrintWriter class is used to write text to a character-output stream. You can use the println() method of the PrintWriter class to write a line to the file.\n\nThe BufferedReader class is used to read text from a character-input stream. You can use the readLine() method of the BufferedReader class to read a line from the file. The readLine() method returns null when the end of the stream is reached.\n\nThe FileReader class is used to read characters from a file. You can use the FileReader class in conjunction with the BufferedReader class to read text from a file.\n\nPlease note that you should always close the resources that you open when you are done with them. In this case, you should close the PrintWriter and the BufferedReader when you are done with them.\n\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: File, PrintWriter, BufferedReader, FileReader\n<<<code>>>: \nFile file = new File(\"db.txt\");\ntry {\n    if (file.createNewFile()) {\n        System.out.println(\"File created\");\n    } else {\n        System.out.println(\"File already exists\");\n    }\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n\ntry (PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(file)) {\n    pw.println(\"Hello\");\n    pw.println(\"World\");\n} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n\ntry (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file))) {\n    String line;\n    while ((line = br.readLine())"}
