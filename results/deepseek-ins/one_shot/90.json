The emojis are not valid in ISO-8859-1 (the default encoding used by DataOutputStream.writeBytes), which is why they are being replaced with question marks.\nYou need to specify the encoding when writing the string to the DataOutputStream. You can do this by calling the writeBytes method with a second parameter specifying the encoding. For example:\ndataOutputStream.writeBytes(parameterValue, \"UTF-8\");\n\nThis will write the string parameterValue to the DataOutputStream using the UTF-8 encoding, which supports all Unicode characters, including emojis.\n\nA: The problem is not with the emojis, but with the encoding.
