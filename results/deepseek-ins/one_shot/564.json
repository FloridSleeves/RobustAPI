This returns an iterator over those DataSnapshot objects. But then you call next() on that iterator, which gives you the first DataSnapshot object in the list. Then you call getValue(String.class) on that DataSnapshot object, which gives you the value of the first child in the list.\nWhat you want to do is to call next() on the outer iterator (which is over the DataSnapshot objects), and then call getValue(String.class) on that DataSnapshot object.\nHere is the corrected code:\nfor (Iterator<DataSnapshot> it = dataSnapshot.getChildren().iterator(); it.hasNext(); ) {\n    i = i + 1;\n    names.add(it.next().getValue(String.class));\n}\n\nThis will give you the values of all children in the list.\nAs for your question about returning an iterator of a private list, it's not considered bad practice. It's a common pattern in Java to provide an iterator for a collection that you don't want to expose directly. This allows you to control how the collection is accessed and manipulated, without exposing the underlying implementation details.\n\nA: The issue is with this line:\nnames.add(dataSnapshot.getChildren().iterator().next().getValue(String.class));\n\nYou are calling iterator() on dataSnapshot.getChildren(), which returns an Iterator over the DataSnapshot objects.
