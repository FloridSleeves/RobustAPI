I am able to find the minimum item, but I am having trouble removing it.  My code is below.  public Comparable removeMin() {    Iterator<T> it = iterator();    T min = it.next();    while (it.hasNext()) {        T next = it.next();        if (min.compareTo(next) > 0)            min = next;        it.remove();    }    System.out.println(min);    return min;}I have the print statement there just to verify that it is in fact getting the minimum item.  The code in main looks like this.public static void main(String[] args) {  Bag<String> sbag = new Bag<String>();    sbag.add(\"Noriko\");    sbag.add(\"Peter\");     sbag.add(\"Buddy\");    sbag.add(\"Mary\");    sbag.removeMin();  }When I run the sbag.removeMin(); command, the console prints \"Buddy\" which tells me that it is choosing \"Buddy\" as the min item.  However, if I instead populate sbag with integers, it always prints the smallest integer, which indicates to me I have my code correct in that regard.I have two questions.1). When passing a list of strings such as above, how does Java determine which is smallest?2). How can I fix my code so that it not only finds the minimum item, but also removes it?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Iterator.next is not working:im tring to get all value for all children from firebase database but when i run this code below i only get the first child value multi times.names=new ArrayList<>();\n        rootRef.addValueEventListener(new ValueEventListener() {\n                    @Override\n                                public void onDataChange(DataSnapshot dataSnapshot) {\n\n                                                for (DataSnapshot dataSnapshot1:dataSnapshot.getChildren()) {\n                                                                    i = i + 1;\n                                                                                        names.add(dataSnapshot.getChildren().iterator().next().getValue(String.class));\n                                                                                                        \n                                                }\n                                                                Toast.makeText(signup.this,\"\"+names,Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();\n\n                                                                            \n                                }\n\n                                            @Override\n                                                        public void onCancelled(DatabaseError databaseError) {\n\n                                                                            \n                                                                }\n                                                                \n        });can i cange the Iterator to a list? i want the simplest way to do it\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: for(Iterator<DataSnapshot> it = dataSnapshot.getChildren().iterator(); it.hasNext(); ){\n  i = i + 1;\n    names.add(it.next().getValue(String.class));\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You're creating a new dataSnapshot.getChildren().iterator() in every iteration of your loop.
