It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Read line using InputStream: :This question already has answers here:                                                            How can I read a large text file line by line using Java?

When you encounter a newline character, you break the loop. The StringBuilder will contain all the characters until the newline.\nQuestion: How to increase the performance of InputStream.read()?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\nint bytesRead;\nwhile ((bytesRead = is.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n    // process the data in buffer\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: By using a larger buffer size, you are reading more data into memory at once. This can significantly increase the performance of InputStream.read(). The buffer size should be chosen based on your specific needs and the characteristics of your data.\n\n\nA: You can use the following approach:\n\n*\n\n*Use a BufferedInputStream to wrap your InputStream. This will allow you to read larger chunks of data at once, which can significantly improve performance.\n\n*Read the first 4 bytes to get the length of the data you're going to receive.\n\n*Then, read the rest of the data into a byte array of the appropriate size.\n\nHere's an example of how you can implement this:\n\n```java\nBufferedInputStream bis = new BufferedInputStream(client.getInputStream());\nbyte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[4];\nbis.read(lengthBuffer);\nint length = (lengthBuffer[0] << 24) | (lengthBuffer[1] << 16) | (lengthBuffer[2] << 8) | lengthBuffer[3];\nbyte[] data = new byte[length];\nbis.read(data);\n```\n\nThis approach should significantly improve the performance of your InputStream.read() method.\n\nA: You can use the following approach:\n\n*\n\n*Use a BufferedInputStream to wrap your InputStream.
