It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block.

When a complete command is read, pass it to handleInput() and clear the StringBuilder. This way, you avoid calling handleInput() with every byte read.\n\nA: The problem is that you're reading one byte at a time, which is very inefficient. You should read into a buffer and then process the data in the buffer. Here's an example of how you can do this:\n\n```java\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\nint bytesRead;\nwhile ((bytesRead = is.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n    // Process the data in the buffer\n    for (int i = 0; i < bytesRead; i++) {\n        byte b = buffer[i];\n        // Process the byte\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis way, you're reading into a buffer and processing the data in the buffer, which is much more efficient than reading one byte at a time.\n\nAlso, you should check if the server is sending data in chunks. If it's sending data in chunks, you should keep reading until you get a chunk that contains the length of the next command. Then you can read that much data and process it.\n\nHere's an example of how you can do this:\n\n```java\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\nint totalBytesRead = 0;\nint nextCommandLength = 0;\nwhile (totalBytesRead < nextCommandLength) {\n    int bytesRead = is.read(buffer, totalBytesRead, nextCommandLength - totalBytesRead);\n    totalBytesRead += bytesRead;\n    // Process the data in the buffer\n    for (int i = 0; i < bytesRead; i++) {\n        byte b = buffer[i];\n        // Process the byte\n    }\n    // Check if the buffer contains the length of the next command\n    if (totalBytesRead >= sizeof(nextCommandLength)) {\n        nextCommandLength = getNextCommandLength(buffer);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis way, you're reading into a buffer and processing the data in the buffer, which is much more efficient than reading one byte at a time.\n\nPlease note that the `getNextCommandLength` method is a placeholder for the actual method that extracts the length of the next command from the buffer. You need to implement this method according to the protocol of your server.\n\nI hope this helps. Let me know if you have any further questions.\n\nA: You can use BufferedReader to read the stream line by line. It's more efficient than reading one byte at a time.\n\n```java\nBufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(is));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {\n    handleInput(line);\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, `handleInput` is a method that you need to implement to handle each line of input.\n\nHowever, if you can't change the server to send data in chunks, you might need to implement a state machine to parse the stream. This is more complex but it will handle any amount of data in the stream.\n\n```java\nenum State {\n    WAITING_FOR_LENGTH,\n    WAITING_FOR_DATA\n}\n\nState state = State.WAITING_FOR_LENGTH;\nint length = 0;\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\nint bytesRead;\nwhile ((bytesRead = is.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n    for (int i = 0; i < bytesRead; i++) {\n        byte b = buffer[i];\n        switch (state) {\n            case WAITING_FOR_LENGTH:\n                // Parse the length from the byte\n                //"}
