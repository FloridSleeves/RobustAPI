It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Buffered Reader HTTP POST: :Looking for a bit of help, I have currently written a HTTP server. It currently handles GET requests fine. However, whilst using POST the buffered reader seems to hang. When the request is stopped the rest of the input stream is read via the buffered reader. I have found a few things on google. I have tried changing the CRLF and the protocol version from 1.1 to 1.0 (browsers automatically make requests as 1.1) Any ideas or help would be appreciated.

This method will block until a line is available, which is more efficient than reading individual characters.\nQuestion: How to use AsyncTask in Android to read data from server:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: AsyncTask\n<<<code>>>: private class ReadTask extends AsyncTask<Void, Void, Void> {\n    protected Void doInBackground(Void... params) {\n        try {\n            // your code to read from server goes here\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            // handle exception\n        }\n        return null;\n    }\n\n    protected void onPostExecute(Void result) {\n        // your code to update UI goes here\n    }\n}\n\nTo start the task, you can call: new ReadTask().execute();\n<<<explanation>>>: Use AsyncTask to perform background operations and publish results on the UI thread without having to manipulate threads and handlers.
