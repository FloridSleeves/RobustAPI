Here is an example:\n\n```java\nString str = \"Hello, World!\";\nbyte[] bytes = str.getBytes();\n```\n\nIn this example, the string \"Hello, World!\" is converted to a byte array. The getBytes() method uses the platform's default charset to encode the String. If you want to specify a different charset, you can do so by passing a Charset to the getBytes() method. For example, to use UTF-8 encoding:\n\n```java\nbyte[] bytes = str.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8);\n```\n\nThis will give you a byte array that represents the string in UTF-8 encoding.\n\nNote: The getBytes() method is available since Java 1.1.\n\nA: Here is how you can convert a String to a byte array in Java:\n\n```java\nString str = \"Hello, World!\";\nbyte[] bytes = str.getBytes();\n```\n\nIn this code, the getBytes() method is used to convert the String str into a byte array. The resulting byte array contains the binary representation of the characters in the string.\n\nIf you want to specify a specific charset (like UTF-8), you can do so like this:\n\n```java\nbyte[] bytes = str.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8);\n```\n\nIn this case, the getBytes() method is called with UTF_8 as the argument, which specifies that the string should be encoded using the UTF-8 charset.\n\nPlease note that the getBytes() method is available since Java 1.1.\n\nA: Here is how you can convert a String to a byte array in Java:\n\n```java\nString str = \"Hello, World!\";\nbyte[] bytes = str.getBytes();\n```\n\nIn this code, the getBytes() method is used to convert the String str into a byte array.
