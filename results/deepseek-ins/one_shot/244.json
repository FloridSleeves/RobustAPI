It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time.

Improve this question                    I'm trying to get the output of a command in a telnet session in Java. I've tried using the TelnetInputStream, but it doesn't seem to work as expected. Here's my current code:\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.net.*;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        Socket sock = new Socket(\"localhost\", 23);\n        PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(sock.getOutputStream(), true);\n        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(sock.getInputStream()));\n\n        String fromServer;\n        String fromUser;\n\n        System.out.println(\"Connected to localhost:\" + sock.getPort());\n        System.out.println(\"Enter command to send to server:\");\n\n        BufferedReader stdIn = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\n        while ((fromUser = stdIn.readLine()) != null) {\n            out.println(fromUser);\n            if (fromUser.equals(\"exit\")) {\n                break;\n            }\n\n            while ((fromServer = in.readLine()) != null) {\n                System.out.println(\"Server says: \" + fromServer);\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n\n        sock.close();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code connects to a telnet server, sends commands, and prints the output. However, it seems to only read the first line of the server's response, and then stops. I've tried using TelnetInputStream, but it doesn't seem to work as expected. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. Any suggestions?\n\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\n\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n\n```java\nwhile ((fromServer = in.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(\"Server says: \" + fromServer);\n}\n```\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The BufferedReader.readLine() method reads a line of text. It returns null if the end of the stream has been reached. This is what you should use to read the entire response from the server. Your current code only reads one line of the server's response and then stops. By using readLine() in a loop, you can read all lines of the server's"}
