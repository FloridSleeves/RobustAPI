I'm trying to modify the text from testfile.txt and write it to a new file named mdemarco.txt. The modification I'm trying to do is add a line number in front of each line.

The BufferedReader reads until it encounters a line break, so it reads all the characters until it encounters a line break, and then it stops.\nYou should use PrintWriter.println() to write a line break after each line. Here is the corrected code:\nPrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream());\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\nprintWriter.flush(); // Make sure the data is sent immediately\n\nAnd then to read the lines:\nServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(1234);\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n\nThis will read the lines one by one until the end of the stream.\n\nA: The problem is that you are not writing a line break after each line.
