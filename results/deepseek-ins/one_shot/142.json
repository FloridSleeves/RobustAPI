Similarly to what you are already doing on the writing side, you could read the data into a byte[] and then use ByteArrayInputputStream and ObjectInputStream.\n\nA: You can use ObjectOutputStream to write objects to a file. When you want to read the object back, you can use ObjectInputStream.\nHere is a simple example:\n// Writing objects to a file\nFileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(\"objects.dat\");\nObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(fos);\n\nYourObject obj1 = new YourObject();\nYourObject obj2 = new YourObject();\n\nout.writeObject(obj1);\nout.writeObject(obj2);\n\nout.close();\n\n// Reading objects from the file\nFileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(\"objects.dat\");\nObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(fis);\n\nYourObject readObj1 = (YourObject) in.readObject();\nYourObject readObj2 = (YourObject) in.readObject();\n\nin.close();\n\nIn this example, replace \"YourObject\" with the class name of the objects you want to write to the file.\nIf you want to read the objects from a random access file, you can seek to the correct position in the file before reading the object. Here is an example:\nRandomAccessFile raf = new RandomAccessFile(\"objects.dat\", \"rw\");\n\n// Seek to the position where the object is written\nraf.seek(position);\n\n// Read the object\nYourObject obj = (YourObject) new ObjectInputStream(raf).readObject();\n\nNote that the position is the byte offset from the beginning of the file. You need to keep track of the positions where you write the objects to the file.\nAlso, remember that the objects you write to the file must implement the Serializable interface.\n\nA: You can use the ObjectOutputStream to write objects to a file.
