The emojis are being replaced with \"=C3=9F\" (UTF-8 encoding) because the server is not receiving the data in UTF-8 encoding.\n\nTo solve this, you need to ensure that the server is receiving the data in UTF-8 encoding. You can do this by setting the content type of the request to \"text/plain; charset=UTF-8\".\n\nHere is how you can do it:\n\n```java\nrequest.setHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"text/plain; charset=UTF-8\");\n```\n\nThis will tell the server to expect UTF-8 encoded text.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that you are using the `Request` class from the Volley library to send the request. If you are using a different library or a custom implementation, you may need to adjust the code accordingly.\n\nAlso, please note that the `getBytes()` method you are using in your code may not always return the correct bytes for a string. You may need to use a different method to convert the string to bytes.\n\nI hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: DataOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>: private void buildSequenceNumberPart(DataOutputStream dataOutputStream, String parameterName, int sequenceNumber) throws IOException {\n    dataOutputStream.writeBytes(twoHyphens + boundary + lineEnd);\n        dataOutputStream.writeBytes(\"Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"\");\n            dataOutputStream.write(parameterName.getBytes(\"UTF-8\"));\n                dataOutputStream.writeBytes(lineEnd);\n                    dataOutputStream.writeBytes(\"Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\" + lineEnd);\n                        dataOutputStream.writeBytes(lineEnd);\n                            dataOutputStream.write(Integer.toString(sequenceNumber).getBytes(\"UTF-8\"));\n                                dataOutputStream.writeBytes(lineEnd);\n\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: Here is how to solve this:\n\nA: The problem is not with the emojis, but with the encoding of the data.
