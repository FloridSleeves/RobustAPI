The compare method splits the key into a prefix and a suffix, and then compares the prefixes. If the prefixes are equal, it compares the suffixes. This ensures that keys with the same prefix are grouped together in the sorted map.\n\n\nA: The problem is that you are removing the key from the TreeMap while iterating over it. This is not allowed in TreeMap. The keys in TreeMap are sorted based on their natural ordering or custom ordering provided by the user. Once a key is removed, the position of the remaining keys in the TreeMap is not guaranteed to be preserved.\n\nA: The problem is that you are modifying the TreeMap while iterating over it.
