Here is an example:\n\n```java\nString str = \"Hello, World!\";\nbyte[] bytes = str.getBytes();\n```\n\nIn this example, the getBytes() method returns a byte array that represents the string \"Hello, World!\". The byte array will contain the UTF-8 encoding of the string.\n\nIf you want to specify a different character set, you can pass it as an argument to the getBytes() method. For example, to use the ISO-8859-1 character set, you can do:\n\n```java\nbyte[] bytes = str.getBytes(\"ISO-8859-1\");\n```\n\nThis will return a byte array that represents the string using the ISO-8859-1 character set.\n\nPlease note that the getBytes() method can throw a UnsupportedEncodingException if the named charset is not supported. You should handle this exception appropriately in your code.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that the byte array returned by getBytes() is not the same as the byte array returned by getBytes(Charset charset) in Java 7 and later. The latter method uses the specified charset to encode the string, while the former method uses the platform's default charset.\n\nI hope this helps clarify how to convert a String to a byte[] in Java.\n\nA: You can use the getBytes() method of the String class in Java.
