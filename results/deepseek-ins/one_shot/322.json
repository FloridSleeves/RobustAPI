Then you call next() on that iterator, which gives you the first child snapshot. But then you are trying to add the value of the first child snapshot to the names list in each iteration of your loop.\nInstead, you should call next() on the iterator of the loop variable dataSnapshot1. Here is the corrected code:\nfor (DataSnapshot dataSnapshot1:dataSnapshot.getChildren()) {\n    i = i + 1;\n    names.add(dataSnapshot1.getValue(String.class));\n}\n\nThis way, you are getting the value of each child snapshot in the loop and adding it to the names list.\n\nA: The issue is that you are creating a new iterator for each child in the loop.
