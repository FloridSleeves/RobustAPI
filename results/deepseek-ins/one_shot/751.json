The StringBufferInputStream class is deprecated in Java 1.6 and removed in Java 1.7. You can use ByteArrayInputStream or StringReader instead.\n\n\nA: The issue is that you are not writing a line break after each write. The BufferedReader reads until it finds a line break, so it reads \"123\" as one line.\nYou should use printWriter.println() instead of printWriter.write(). println() automatically appends a line break.\nTry this:\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\n\nA: You are using PrintWriter.write() which writes a string to the output stream. It does not append a newline character. So, when you read from the BufferedReader, it reads until it finds a newline character, which is why you are getting \"123\" as one line.\nYou should use PrintWriter.println() instead, which writes a line to the output stream and appends a newline character.\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\n\nA: You should use printWriter.println() instead of printWriter.write(). println() appends a newline character to the output.\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\nThis will send each line as a separate message, and you should be able to read each line separately with bufferedReader.readLine().\n\nA: You should use printWriter.println() instead of printWriter.write(). println() automatically appends a newline character.\nTry this:\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\nThis will send each line as a separate message, and you should be able to read each line separately with bufferedReader.readLine().\n\nA: You should use printWriter.println() instead of printWriter.write(). println() automatically appends a newline character.\nTry this:\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\nThis will send each line as a separate message, and you should be able to read each line separately with bufferedReader.readLine().\n\nA: You should use printWriter.println() instead of printWriter.write(). println() automatically appends a newline character.\nTry this:\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\nThis will send each line as a separate message, and you should be able to read each line separately with bufferedReader.readLine().\n\nA: You should use printWriter.println() instead of printWriter.write(). println() automatically appends a newline character.\nTry this:\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\nThis will send each line as a separate message, and you should be able to read each line separately with bufferedReader.readLine().\n\nA: You should use printWriter.println() instead of printWriter.write(). println() automatically appends a newline character.\nTry this:\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\nThis will send each line as a separate message, and you should be able to read each line separately with bufferedReader.readLine().\n\nA: You should use printWriter.println() instead of printWriter.write(). println() automatically appends a newline character.\nTry this:\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\nThis will send each line as a separate message, and you should be able to read each line separately with bufferedReader.readLine().\n\nA: You should use printWriter.println() instead of printWriter.write()."}
