The cursor can be iterated over to get the IDs.\n\n\nA: You can use the SQLiteDatabase.query() method to execute a SQL query. The method takes the following parameters:\n\n\n*\n\n*table: The name of the table to query.\n\n*columns: An array of columns to return. Pass null to return all columns.\n\n*selection: A filter declaring which rows to return. Pass null to return all rows.\n\n*selectionArgs: You may include ? placeholders in selection, then bind these arguments to the placeholders using the selectionArgs parameter.\n\n*groupBy: Group the rows by the specified columns. Pass null to have no grouping.\n\n*having: A filter declaring which group rows to include in the cursor. Pass null to have no filtering.\n\n*orderBy: Sort order. Use null for the default sort order.\n\n\nIn your case, you want to select all rows from a table where col1 equals something and col2 is not null. You can do this by setting the selection string to \"col1 = ? AND col2 IS NOT NULL\" and the selectionArgs to a string array containing the value you want to compare col1 to.\n\nHere is an example:\n\nCursor cursor = db.query(\"MyTable\", null,\n    \"col1 = ? AND col2 IS NOT NULL\",\n    new String[] { \"something\" },\n    null, null, null);\n\nThis will return a Cursor that you can use to iterate over the results.\n\nA: You are on the right track. The issue is with the selectionArgs parameter. The selectionArgs parameter is an array of Strings that are substituted for the placeholders in the selection parameter.\nIn your case, you want to compare col1 with a string value, and col2 should be not null. So, you should not use any placeholders in your selection string.\nHere is the corrected code:\nCursor cursor = db.query(\"MyTable\", null,\n    \"col1 = ? AND col2 IS NOT NULL\",\n    new String[] { \"something\" },\n    null, null, null);\n\nIn this code, \"something\" is the value you are comparing col1 with. If you want to compare col1 with a different value, just replace \"something\" with the desired value.\nAlso, make sure to close the database connection after you are done with the query. You can do this by calling db.close().\n\nA: You are on the right track. The issue is with the selectionArgs parameter.
