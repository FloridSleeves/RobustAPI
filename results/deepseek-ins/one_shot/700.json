You should initialize the 'items' array before using it. You can do this by adding the following line in the constructor of the StringPrinter class: `items = new String[2];`.\n\n\nA: The problem is that you're not flushing the PrintWriter after writing to it. The PrintWriter buffers the output, and doesn't actually write it to the underlying output stream until you call flush().\nSo, you should add printWriter.flush() after printWriter.write(\"1\");, printWriter.write(\"2\");, and printWriter.write(\"3\");.\nHere is the corrected code:\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.flush(); // Flush the PrintWriter\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.flush(); // Flush the PrintWriter\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nprintWriter.flush(); // Flush the PrintWriter\n\n\nA: The problem is that you're not flushing the PrintWriter after each write.
