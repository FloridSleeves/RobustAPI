You have to convert your ByteArray to int array.\n\nA: The issue is likely due to the encoding of the text. The emojis are not being encoded properly, which is causing them to be replaced with other characters.\nYou can try to encode the text in UTF-8 before sending it. Here is how you can do it:\n```kotlin\nval text = \"Your text with emojis\"\nval encodedText = text.toByteArray(Charsets.UTF_8)\n```\nThen, you can add this encoded text to your parameters:\n```kotlin\nparameters[\"text\"] = String(encodedText)\n```\nThis should ensure that the emojis are correctly encoded and sent.\n\nFor the second part of your question, you can merge three ByteArrays together using the plus operator:\n```kotlin\nval mergedBytes = avroBinaryValue + byteSchemaName + byteLMD\n```\nTo split the merged ByteArray, you can use the array slicing feature in Kotlin:\n```kotlin\nval avroBytes = mergedBytes.sliceArray(0 until avroBinaryValue.size)\nval schemaNameBytes = mergedBytes.sliceArray(avroBinaryValue.size until (avroBinaryValue.size + byteSchemaName.size))\nval lastModifiedDateBytes = mergedBytes.sliceArray((avroBinaryValue.size + byteSchemaName.size) until mergedBytes.size)\n```\nThis will give you the three separate ByteArrays that you can use separately.\n\nPlease note that the size of the merged ByteArray will be the sum of the sizes of the individual ByteArrays. You can determine the size of each individual ByteArray by accessing its size property.\n\nAlso, remember to handle the ByteArrays properly to prevent memory leaks. You can do this by setting them to null when they are no longer needed.\n\nI hope this helps to solve your problem.
