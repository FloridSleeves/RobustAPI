It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Safely reading http request headers in java: :I'm building my own HTTP webserver in java and would like to implement some security measures while reading the http request header from a socket inputstream.I'm trying to prevent scenario's where someone sending extremely long single line headers or absurd amounts of header lines would cause memory overflows or other things you wouldn't want.I'm currently trying to do this by reading 8kb of data into a byte array and parse all the headers within the buffer I just created.But as far as I know this means your inputstream's current offset is always already 8kb from it's starting point, even if you had only 100bytes of header.the code I have so far:InputStream stream = socket.getInputStream();HashMap<String, String> headers = new HashMap<String, String>();byte [] buffer = new byte[8*1024];stream.read( buffer , 0 , 8*1024);ByteArrayInputStream bytestream = new ByteArrayInputStream( buffer );InputStreamReader streamReader = new InputStreamReader( bytestream );BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader( streamReader );String requestline = reader.readLine();for ( ;; ){    String line = reader.readLine();    if ( line.equals( \"\" ) )        break;    String[] header = line.split( \":\" , 2 );    headers.put( header[0] , header[1] ); //TODO: check for bad header}//if contentlength > 0//      read bodySo my question is, how can I be sure that I'm reading the body data (if any) starting from the correct position in the inputstream?I don't exactly use streams a lot so I don't really have a feel for them and google hasn't been helpful so far\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Android InputStream.read() horribly slow:I'm working on an Android app that needs to communicate with a server (running on my PC) which is also written by me.

If you read less than the contentLength, it means you have not reached the end of the stream yet. If you read -1, it means the stream has ended.\nQuestion: How to read a file from a server using Java: :I'm trying to read a file from a server using Java. I've been given the file's URL and I'm trying to read it using a BufferedReader. However, I'm getting an error saying that the URL is not found. I've tried using the URL class to create a URL object and then using the openStream() method to get an InputStream, but I'm still getting the error. Here's my code:\nURL url = new URL(\"http://www.example.com/file.txt\");\nInputStream is = url.openStream();\nBufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(is));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\nbr.close();\n\nI'm getting the error: \"java.io.FileNotFoundException: http://www.example.com/file.txt (The requested URL was not found on this server.)\".
