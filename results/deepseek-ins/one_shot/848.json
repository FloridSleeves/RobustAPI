I'd like to take advantage of this feature.Here's the scenario.File FOO.BAR is 20 MB.  I'd split it into some arbitrary chunk size, let's say 1 MB, which means 20 chunks.   Chunks #3 and #14 fail (maybe the cellular/WiFi connection was bad).  I can now re-upload just these two chunks and everything will be good.What I'd like to know is how can I read only part of a file (like the data between 3MB and 4MB)?  The file piece should be an InputStream or File object.Thanks,Makoto\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How do I read the last \"n\" bytes of a file in Java: How do I read the last n number of bytes from a file, without using RandomAccessFile.

A random access file behaves like a large array of bytes stored in the file system. \n\nA: You can use RandomAccessFile to read the last n bytes of a file. Here is an example:\nRandomAccessFile raf = new RandomAccessFile(file, \"r\");\nraf.seek(raf.length() - n);\nbyte[] bytes = new byte[n];\nraf.read(bytes);\nraf.close();\n\nIn this code, file is the path to your file, n is the number of bytes you want to read from the end of the file. The bytes read are stored in the byte array bytes.\nThis code works by first seeking to the end of the file with raf.seek(raf.length() - n), then reading n bytes into the byte array. The read method returns the number of bytes read, which should be n in this case.\nPlease note that RandomAccessFile is not recommended for reading large files because it can consume a lot of memory. If you need to read large files, consider using a FileInputStream with a FileChannel and a MappedByteBuffer.\n\nA: You can use a RandomAccessFile to read the last n bytes of a file.
