Thank you for any help with getting a list of applications capable of viewing a file===================================EditAlright well something easier how can i get the applications from the above intent into an arraylist i could just do image/* audio/* etc and add them all to a list and then list them in a listview and that would solve my problem\nPlease using this api: ApplicationInfo.loadIcon.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: I have stored package name of an application by the following code\nmActivityManager = (ActivityManager)this.context.getSystemService(Context.ACTIVITY_SERVICE);\nfor (ApplicationInfo packageInfo : packages)\n{\n    String pck = packageInfo.packageName;\n    if(pck.startsWith(\"com.google\") )\n    {\n            app = new APP(R.drawable.ic_launcher,packageInfo.packageName);\n            application_package.add(app);\n            continue;\n    }\n    if((packageInfo.flags & ApplicationInfo.FLAG_SYSTEM)==1)continue;\n    if(packageInfo.packageName.equals(\"com.walton.taskkiller\")) continue;\n    app = new APP(R.drawable.ic_launcher,packageInfo.packageName);\n    application_package.add(app);\n}\nNow I want to know Application name and application icon .

Then use PackageManager's queryIntentActivities method to get a list of ResolveInfo objects. Each ResolveInfo represents an activity that can handle the intent. You can get the package name of the activity with info.activityInfo.packageName.\nQuestion: How can I get the application name from package name?\n\nPlease using this api: PackageManager.getApplicationLabel.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PackageManager.getApplicationLabel\n<<<code>>>: PackageManager packageManager = getPackageManager();\nApplicationInfo applicationInfo = packageManager.getApplicationInfo(packageName, 0);\nCharSequence appName = packageManager.getApplicationLabel(applicationInfo);\n<<<explanation>>>: First get the instance of package manager, then get ApplicationInfo instance using package name. Then use PackageManager's getApplicationLabel method to get the application name.\n\nA: You can use PackageManager to get the ApplicationInfo of a package and then use loadLabel and loadIcon methods of ApplicationInfo to get the name and icon of the application.\nHere is the code:\nPackageManager packageManager = getPackageManager();\nApplicationInfo applicationInfo;\ntry {\n    applicationInfo = packageManager.getApplicationInfo(packageName, 0);\n    CharSequence appName = packageManager.getApplicationLabel(applicationInfo);\n    Drawable appIcon = packageManager.getApplicationIcon(applicationInfo);\n} catch (PackageManager.NameNotFoundException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n\nIn this code, packageName is the package name of the application you want to get the name and icon of.\n\nA: You can use PackageManager to get the ApplicationInfo of a package and then use loadLabel and loadIcon methods of ApplicationInfo to get the name and icon of the application.\nHere is the code:\nPackageManager packageManager = getPackageManager();\nApplicationInfo applicationInfo;\ntry {\n    applicationInfo = packageManager.getApplicationInfo(packageName, 0);\n    CharSequence appName = packageManager.getApplicationLabel(applicationInfo);\n    Drawable appIcon = packageManager.getApplicationIcon(applicationInfo);\n} catch (PackageManager.NameNotFoundException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n\nIn this code, packageName is the package name of the application you want to get the name and icon of.\n\nA: You can use PackageManager to get the ApplicationInfo of a package and then use loadLabel and loadIcon methods of ApplicationInfo to get the name and icon of the application.\nHere is the code:\nPackageManager packageManager = getPackageManager();\nApplicationInfo applicationInfo;\ntry {\n    applicationInfo = packageManager.getApplicationInfo(packageName, 0);\n    CharSequence appName = packageManager.getApplicationLabel(applicationInfo);\n    Drawable appIcon = packageManager.getApplicationIcon(applicationInfo);\n} catch (PackageManager.NameNotFoundException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n\nIn this code, packageName is the package name of the application you want to get the name and icon of.\n\nA: You can use PackageManager to get the ApplicationInfo of a package and then use loadLabel and loadIcon methods of ApplicationInfo to get the name and icon of the application.\nHere is the code:\nPackageManager packageManager = getPackageManager();\nApplicationInfo applicationInfo;\ntry {\n    applicationInfo = packageManager.getApplicationInfo(packageName, 0);\n    CharSequence appName = packageManager.getApplicationLabel(applicationInfo);\n    Drawable appIcon = packageManager.getApplicationIcon(applicationInfo);\n} catch (PackageManager.NameNotFoundException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n\nIn this code, packageName is the package name of the application you want to get the name and icon of.\n\nA: You can"}
