Make sure to call flush() to ensure all bytes are sent.\n\n\nA: The problem is that you are treating the byte array as a string. When you use the write method of DataOutputStream, it interprets the byte array as a string. This is why emojis are being converted to other characters.\nInstead of using write, you should use writeByte or writeBytes to send each byte of the byte array.
