You need to manually add it. The \"\\r\\n\" sequence is the standard Windows-style newline character.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\\n\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem.

It returns null when the stream ends.

It returns null when the stream ends. So you need to read the lines in a loop until it returns null.\n\nA: The problem is that you're not sending newline characters (\\n) after each line of text. The BufferedReader.readLine() method reads until it encounters a newline character, so it's reading"}
