The default value of a double variable is 0.0.\ndouble x;\n\nThen, you can assign a value to x later in your code.\nx = 5.0;\n\nTo raise x to a power, you can use the Math.pow() function.\ndouble result = Math.pow(x, 2); // This will store the square of x in the variable result.\n\nIn your specific case, you can modify your f method to use the variable x like this:\npublic static double f(int i, double polynomialCoefficient) {\n    if (i == 0) {\n        return polynomialCoefficient;\n    }\n    double x;\n    return polynomialCoefficient * Math.pow(x, i);\n}\n\nThis will raise the variable x to the power of i for each term in your polynomial. However, please note that this will always raise x to the power of 0, because the value of x is not being changed in the loop. If you want to raise x to the power of i for each term in your polynomial, you will need to create a new variable inside the loop that changes with each iteration.\n\nA: You can declare a variable without initializing it by using the \"double\" data type.
