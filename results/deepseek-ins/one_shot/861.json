It blocks until the required number of bytes have been read. This is different from the read method which reads up to the end of the file. If the end of the file is reached before the required number of bytes have been read, the method returns -1.\n\nIn your code, the readFully method is used to ensure that the entire byte array is filled with data before the String is created. If the read method is used instead of readFully, the String may contain null characters at the end of the byte array if the end of the file is reached before the required number of bytes have been read. This would cause the trim method to remove unnecessary characters from the end of the String.\n\nThe readFully method is used in the same way for both b1 and b2. The difference is that b1 is used to read the first name and b2 is used to read the last name. The balance is read separately using the readDouble method.\n\nSo, the code is correct and does not need any changes.\n\nQuestion: Why is RandomAccessFile writeLong implemented with multiple write calls?: While profiling an application I noticed that RandomAccessFile.writeLong was taking a lot of time.\n\nI checked the code for this method, and it involves eight calls of the native method write.

Each byte of the long value is written separately. This is done by shifting the long value right by 56, 48, 40, 32, 24, 16, 8, and 0 bits respectively, and masking the result with 0xFF to get the byte value. This byte value is then written to the file using the write method of RandomAccessFile. This approach is more efficient than converting the long value to a string or byte array and then writing the string or byte array, as it avoids the overhead of string conversion and byte array conversion.\n\nSo, the implementation of writeLong in RandomAccessFile is not optimized for performance, and it can be improved by using a byte array to store the long value in big-endian order and then writing the byte array using the write method. This approach can be more efficient because it avoids the overhead of multiple write calls.\n\nHere is an optimized implementation of writeLong using a byte array:\n\n```java\nRandomAccessFile randomAccessFile = new RandomAccessFile(\"out.dat\", \"rwd\");\nbyte[] aux = new byte[8];\nfor (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {\n    aux[i] = (byte) ((l >>> ((7 - i) * 8)) & 0xFF);\n}\nrandomAccessFile.write(aux);\n```\n\nIn this implementation, the long value is shifted right by 56, 48, 40, 32, 24, 16, 8, and 0 bits respectively, and masked with 0xFF to get the byte value. This byte value is"}
