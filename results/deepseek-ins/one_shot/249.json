It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Transfer Audio-File from Client to Http Server via URLConnection: :i am currently working on a programming-project in my school. I need to send an audio file (MIDI format) from the Client successfully to a Http Server. I already tried to do this myself and did much research on the internet and in the Stackoverflow forum.
