My question is what is causing this exception?  Thanks\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: pw.println(\"---------------------------------------\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The exception is caused by the fact that you are trying to write to a closed PrintWriter. You are closing the PrintWriter in the printExp method, but then trying to write to it in the constructor. This is not allowed and will result in a NullPointerException. You should move the closing of the PrintWriter to the printExp method.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem. That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: System.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\n<<<explanation>>>: The BufferedReader.readLine() method reads a line of text. It returns the next line of text from the input stream. The line is considered to be terminated by any one of a line feed ('\\n'), a carriage return ('\\r'), or a carriage return followed immediately by a line feed. In your case, you are only sending \"123\" to the server, so the BufferedReader.readLine() method is reading the whole input as one line. If you want to read each line separately, you should call BufferedReader.readLine() in a loop until it returns null, which indicates the end of the stream.\n\n\nA: The problem is that you are writing to the PrintWriter without a line separator. The BufferedReader.readLine() method reads until it encounters a line separator, which is not provided in your write() calls.\nTry this:\nprintWriter.write(\"1\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\\n\");\n\nThis will ensure that each write is followed by a line separator, which the BufferedReader.readLine() method will recognize as the end of a line.\n\nA: The problem is that you are writing to the PrintWriter without a line separator.
