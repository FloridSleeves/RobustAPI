But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Converting text file to all uppercase letters: :I have an assignment for class and I have to make a program that takes an existing file and converts all the letters to uppercase. Below is part of the code (specifically the loop): // Read lines from the file until no more are left.  while (inputFile.hasNext())  {      // Read the next name.     String friendName = inputFile.nextLine();      // Need line to make all letters uppercase  }  System.out.print(\"Enter the saved file name: \");  String filename2 = keyboard.nextLine();When I run it now: I am able to open the first text file and a second txt file is created, but there is no letters in the new file. \nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem.

You can use it to convert the string 'friendName' to uppercase before writing it to the output file.\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"filename.txt\"));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\nreader.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The BufferedReader class in Java is used to read the content from a reader (such as FileReader) and buffers the input so that input can be read and processed line by line. The readLine() method reads a line of text. It returns null when there is no more data to read.\nQuestion: How to write to a file in Java:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"filename.txt\", \"UTF-8\");\nwriter.println(\"Hello, World!\");\nwriter.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The PrintWriter class in Java is used for writing text to a character-output stream. It provides methods to write formatted data to the output. The println() method writes a line to the output stream followed by a line separator.\nQuestion: How to read a file line by line in Java:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"filename.txt\"));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\nreader.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The BufferedReader class in Java is used to read the content from a reader (such as FileReader) and buffers the input so that input can be read and processed line by line. The readLine() method reads a line of text.

It provides methods to write formatted data to the output. The println() method writes a line to the output stream followed by a line separator.\nQuestion: How to read a file character by character in Java:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileReader\n<<<code>>>: FileReader reader = new FileReader(\"filename.txt\");\nint character;\nwhile ((character = reader.read()) != -1) {\n    System.out.print((char) character);\n}\nreader.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The FileReader class in Java is used to read the content from a file. The read() method reads a single character. It returns -1 when there is no more data to read.\nQuestion: How to write to a file character by character in Java:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileWriter\n<<<code>>>: FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(\"filename.txt\");\nwriter.write('H');\nwriter.write('e');\nwriter.write('l');\nwriter.write('l');\nwriter.write('o');\nwriter.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The FileWriter class in Java is used for writing characters to a file. The write() method writes a single character.\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"filename.txt\"));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\nreader.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The BufferedReader class in Java is used to read the content from a reader (such as FileReader) and buffers the input so that input can be"}
