Without flushing, the data may not be sent immediately.\nTry this:\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\\n\");\nprintWriter.flush();\n\nAlso, make sure you close the PrintWriter after you're done writing.\nprintWriter.close();\n\n\nA: You need to add a newline character (\"\\n\") after each line you want to send. This tells the BufferedReader that you're done with the current line and it can start reading the next one.\nTry this:\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\\n\");\nprintWriter.flush();\n\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\n\nThis should print \"1\" when you call bufferedReader.readLine().\n\nA: You need to add a newline character (\"\\n\") after each line you want to send.
