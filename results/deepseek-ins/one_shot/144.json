When the server receives the file, it doesn't know how big the file is. You need to send the file size before sending the file data.\n\nA: \nI want to be able to read the object directly using Object Input Stream. How to achieve this ?\n\nYou can't directly read objects from a RandomAccessFile using ObjectInputStream. ObjectInputStream reads objects from an InputStream. A RandomAccessFile is a file that allows reading/writing of data at any position in the file. It doesn't provide an InputStream interface.\nHowever, you can read the object from a FileChannel. Here's an example:\nRandomAccessFile raf = new RandomAccessFile(\"yourfile.dat\", \"r\");\nFileChannel channel = raf.getChannel();\nlong position = 0; // position in the file where the object is written\nlong size = 1024; // size of the object\nByteBuffer buf = ByteBuffer.allocate((int) size);\nchannel.read(buf, position);\nbuf.flip();\nObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(new ByteArrayInputStream(buf.array()));\nObject obj = ois.readObject();\n\nThis code reads the object from the file at the specified position and size. It creates a ByteBuffer of the appropriate size, reads the data into the buffer, wraps the buffer in a ByteArrayInputStream, and then uses an ObjectInputStream to read the object.\n\nWhy does the size of the file always zero when uploading through web socket client?\n\nThe size of the file is zero because you're not sending the file size with the file data. When the server receives the file, it doesn't know how big the file is.

It creates a ByteBuffer of the appropriate size, reads the data into the buffer, wraps the buffer in a ByteArrayInputStream, and then uses an ObjectInputStream to read the object.\n\nWhy does the size of the file always zero when uploading through web socket client?\n\nThe size of the file is zero because you're not sending the file size with the file data.

When the server receives the file, it doesn't know how big the file is. You need to send the file size before sending the file data.\n\nPlease advice.\n\nThe server should know the size of the file before it starts receiving the data. You can send the file size as a separate message before sending the file data. Here is an example of how you can do this:\n\nClient:\n```java\nfunction sendFile() {\n    var file = document.getElementById('filename').files[0];\n    ws.send('filename:'+file.name+':'+file"}
