I have the saved files set up so that on every line there is the name of a method in my Main program. What I need to do is to look in a certain line for text and execute the method that the text is referring to.\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: public static void loadGame(String fileName) {\n    try {\n        FileReader fileReader = new FileReader(fileName);\n        BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(fileReader);\n        String line;\n        while((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) {\n            // Here you can add the logic to execute the method based on the line read\n        }\n        bufferedReader.close();\n    } catch(IOException ex) {\n        System.out.println(\"Error reading file '\" + fileName + \"'\");\n    }\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: This code reads a file line by line and executes a method based on the line read. You need to add the logic to execute the method based on the line read in the while loop.\n\n\nA: You can use a while loop to read lines until you reach the end of the file. Here is a simple example:\n\n```java\nBufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\nString line;\nList<String> lines = new ArrayList<>();\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null && !line.equals(\"exit\")) {\n    lines.add(line);\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, the loop will continue to read lines from the console until the user enters \"exit\". The read lines are then added to a list.\n\nIf you want to read all lines from the console without any limit, you can use a do-while loop instead:\n\n```java\nBufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\nString line;\nList<String> lines = new ArrayList<>();\ndo {\n    line = br.readLine();\n    lines.add(line);\n} while (line != null);\n```\n\nIn this code, the loop will continue to read lines from the console until the end of the input stream is reached. The read lines are then added to a list.\n\nPlease note that the BufferedReader.readLine() method does not wait for input from the console after the last line. It will return null when there are no more lines to read.\n\nA: You can use a Scanner to read lines from the console. Here is an example:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n        List<String> lines = new ArrayList<>();\n        System.out.println(\"Enter lines of text. Enter 'exit' to finish:\");\n        while (scanner.hasNextLine()) {\n            String line = scanner.nextLine();\n            if (line.equals(\"exit\")) {\n                break;\n            }\n            lines.add(line);\n        }\n        scanner.close();\n\n        // Print the lines\n        for (String line : lines) {\n            System.out.println(line);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, the program will continue to read lines from the console until the user enters \"exit\". The read lines are then added to a list. The program will then print the lines to the console.\n\nPlease note that the Scanner.nextLine() method does not wait for input from the console after the last line. It will return an empty string when there are no more lines to read.\n\nA: You can use a while loop to read lines until you reach the end of the file.
