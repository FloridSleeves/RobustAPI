Try to just use the value of the foreach inside the loop.\n\nA: The issue is that you're calling dataSnapshot.getChildren().iterator().next() in each iteration of your loop. This means that you're always getting the first child of the DataSnapshot, regardless of which iteration you're on.\nInstead, you should use the iterator you've created in the for loop to get the children of the DataSnapshot. Here's how you can do it:\nfor(Iterator<DataSnapshot> it = dataSnapshot.getChildren().iterator(); it.hasNext(); ){\n    i = i + 1;\n    names.add(it.next().getValue(String.class));\n}\n\nThis way, you're using the same iterator to get all the children of the DataSnapshot, and you'll get all the values you're looking for.\n\nA: You are using the same iterator for all children. You should create a new iterator for each child.\nfor (DataSnapshot dataSnapshot1:dataSnapshot.getChildren()) {\n    i = i + 1;\n    Iterator<DataSnapshot> childIterator = dataSnapshot1.getChildren().iterator();\n    while(childIterator.hasNext()) {\n        names.add(childIterator.next().getValue(String.class));\n    }\n}\n\nThis way, you create a new iterator for each child of the DataSnapshot, so you can iterate over all children of each child.\n\nA: You are using the same iterator for all children.
