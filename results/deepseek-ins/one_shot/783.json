But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\n\nYou should use printWriter.println() instead of printWriter.write() to write a line break.\n\nA: You are using PrintWriter.write() which writes the string as is. It does not append a newline character. So, when you read the lines using BufferedReader, it reads until it finds a newline character. Since you are not providing a newline character after \"1\", \"2\" and \"3\", it reads them as a single line.\n\nYou should use PrintWriter.println() instead of PrintWriter.write() to write a line break.\n\nHere is the corrected code:\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\nAnd then you can read the lines using BufferedReader:\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\n\nThis will print \"1\" on the first readLine(), \"2\" on the second readLine(), and \"3\" on the third readLine().\n\nA: You are using PrintWriter.write() which writes the string as is.
