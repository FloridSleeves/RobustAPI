But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Receiving Data On Sinatra Server: :I am able to send data to a sinatra server (Strings) but I'm not sure about how to actually receive it in the sinatra code.

To receive multiple lines, you can use the BufferedReader.readLine method which reads a line of text.
