This will not affect the iterator's position.\n\nA: The issue is with this line:\nnames.add(it.next().getValue(String.class));\n\nYou are calling it.next() inside the loop, which means you are always getting the next element from the iterator, and you are not resetting it. So, in the first loop iteration, you are getting the first element, and in the second loop iteration, you are trying to get the first element again, and so on.\nInstead, you should call it.next() only once per loop iteration, and then add the value to the list.
