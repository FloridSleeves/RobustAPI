In your case, you are writing the line and then closing the PrintWriter. This means that the next write will overwrite the previous content. You should open the PrintWriter before the while loop and close it after the while loop.\n\nA: The problem is that you are not flushing the PrintWriter after each write. The PrintWriter buffers the output and only writes it to the underlying output stream when you call flush().\nSo, you should call printWriter.flush() after printWriter.write(line + \"\\n\");\nHere is the corrected code:\ntry (PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hp\\\\Desktop\\\\result3.txt\", \"UTF-8\")) {\n    while (true) {\n        line = r.readLine();\n        if (line == null) {\n            break;\n        }\n        System.out.println(line);\n        writer.write(line + \"\\n\");\n        writer.flush(); // flush the PrintWriter\n    }\n}\n\nAlso, you should use try-with-resources statement to automatically close the PrintWriter. This will ensure that the PrintWriter is closed even if an exception occurs.\n\nA: You need to flush the PrintWriter after each write. This will ensure that the data is written to the file immediately.\nTry this:\ntry {\n    printWriter.write(\"1\\n\");\n    printWriter.flush();\n    printWriter.write(\"2\\n\");\n    printWriter.flush();\n    printWriter.write(\"3\\n\");\n    printWriter.flush();\n} catch (Exception e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n\nThe \"\\n\" is used to create a new line in the file.\n\nA: You need to flush the PrintWriter after each write. This will ensure that the data is written to the file immediately.\nTry this:\ntry {\n    printWriter.write(\"1\\n\");\n    printWriter.flush();\n    printWriter.write(\"2\\n\");\n    printWriter.flush();\n    printWriter.write(\"3\\n\");\n    printWriter.flush();\n} catch (Exception e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n\nThe \"\\n\" is used to create a new line in the file.\n\nA: You need to flush the PrintWriter after each write.
