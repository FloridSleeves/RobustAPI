It begins with \"1\" but when I find the word second time , the key increments and then the put method inserts a new entry with a new keyBut i would like to have only one entry and modify the key.Can this be done?How can i have only one object in a HashMap and modify the key every time?

If the key does not exist in the map, we add it with the value \"foo.txt\". If the key does exist, we increment the key by 1 and add it to the map with the value \"foo.txt\".\n\n\nA: You can use the following code to increment the value of a key in a HashMap:\nMap<String, Integer> freq = new HashMap<String, Integer>();\nString word = \"Hello\";\n\nif (freq.containsKey(word)) {\n    freq.put(word, freq.get(word) + 1);\n} else {\n    freq.put(word, 1);\n}\n\nThis code checks if the word is already in the map. If it is, it increments the count by 1. If it's not, it adds the word to the map with a count of 1.\nFor your second question, you can use the following code to add a new file to the value of a key in a HashMap:\nMap<Integer, String> DocsCollection = new HashMap<Integer, String>();\nint key = 1;\nString file = \"foo.txt\";\n\nif (DocsCollection.containsKey(key)) {\n    DocsCollection.put(key, DocsCollection.get(key) + \",\" + file);\n} else {\n    DocsCollection.put(key, file);\n}\n\nThis code checks if the key is already in the map. If it is, it appends the new file to the existing value. If it's not, it adds the key and value to the map.\n\nA: You can use the following code to increment the value of a key in a HashMap:\nMap<String, Integer> freq = new HashMap<String, Integer>();\nString word = \"Hello\";\n\nif (freq.containsKey(word)) {\n    freq.put(word, freq.get(word) + 1);\n} else {\n    freq.put(word, 1);\n}\n\nThis code checks if the word is already in the map.
