You cannot have same id for the view's in the same view tree. (must be unique).\n\nA: \nwhy doesn't it give error just like we get in java code?\n\nThe Android system does not enforce unique IDs in the same hierarchy. It's a design decision made by the Android system developers. They decided that it's okay to have multiple views with the same ID in the same hierarchy because it's a common occurrence in XML layouts.\n\nhow does environment decide to which component it needs to invoke?\n\nThe environment uses the IDs you provide in your XML layout files to match them with the corresponding components in your Java code. When you call findViewById(), it looks for a view in the current view hierarchy that has the ID you provided.\n\nIn case we have to use 2 XMLs in an Activity, one as activity.setcontentview(layout1) and another as a PopupWindow.setContentView(layout2). What will happen in such case?\n\nIf you call setContentView() on an Activity, it will replace the current content view with the layout defined in the XML file you provide. If you then call setContentView() on a PopupWindow, it will replace the content view of the PopupWindow with the layout defined in the XML file you provide.\n\nPopulating a ListView using an ArrayList?:\n\nHere is a simple example of how to populate a ListView using an ArrayList:\n\n```java\n@Override\npublic void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n    ListView myListView = (ListView) findViewById(R.id.my_list_view);\n    ArrayList<String> myData = new ArrayList<String>();\n    myData.add(\"Data 1\");\n    myData.add(\"Data 2\");\n    ArrayAdapter<String> adapter = new ArrayAdapter<String>(this, android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1, myData);\n    myListView.setAdapter(adapter);\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, we first find the ListView in the layout using findViewById() and assign it to myListView. We then create an ArrayList and add some data to it. We then create an ArrayAdapter that uses the simple_list_item_1 layout to display the data in the ListView. Finally, we set the adapter of the ListView to the ArrayAdapter.\n\nThis will populate the ListView with the data from the ArrayList.\n\nPlease note that the IDs in the XML layout files (like R.layout.activity_main and R.id.my_list_view) are used by the system to match views in your Java code with views in your XML layout files. They must be unique within their respective layout files, but they don't need to be unique across different layout files.\n\nAlso, remember that you need to call setContentView() before calling findViewById(). This is because findViewById() needs to know where to look for the views in the current view hierarchy.\n\nI hope this helps clarify things for you. Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
