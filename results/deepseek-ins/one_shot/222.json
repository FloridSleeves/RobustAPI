It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: How to I find out the size of a GZIP section embedded in firmware?: :I am currently analyzing firmware images which contain many different sections, one of which is a GZIP section.

You can then read from the GZIPInputStream in a loop, keeping track of how many bytes you read. The total number of bytes read is the compressed size of the GZIP section.\n\nA: You can use the GZIPInputStream.getCompressedSize() method to get the compressed size of the GZIP section.\nHere is an example:\nGZIPInputStream gis = new GZIPInputStream(new ByteArrayInputStream(yourFirmwareBytes, startOfGzipSection, lengthOfGzipSection));\ntry {\n    byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\n    int bytesRead;\n    while ((bytesRead = gis.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n        // process the data\n    }\n    long compressedSize = gis.getCompressedSize();\n    System.out.println(\"Compressed size: \" + compressedSize);\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n\nThis code reads the GZIP section into a ByteArrayInputStream, then wraps that in a GZIPInputStream. It then reads from the GZIPInputStream in a loop, processing the data as it is read. The compressed size is then obtained from the GZIPInputStream using the getCompressedSize() method.\nPlease note that the getCompressedSize() method is available from Java 7 onwards.
