You need to call the println method of the PrintWriter to write the content of the string s to the file. After the while loop, you should close the PrintWriter to ensure all the data is written to the file.\n\nA: The problem is that you're not flushing the PrintWriter after each write. The write method in PrintWriter doesn't actually write the data to the underlying stream until you call flush.\nSo, you should change your code to:\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\\n\");\nprintWriter.flush();\nprintWriter.write(\"2\\n\");\nprintWriter.flush();\nprintWriter.write(\"3\\n\");\nprintWriter.flush();\n\nAnd then you should be able to read the data correctly with:\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\n\nThis will print \"1\", \"2\", and \"3\" on separate lines.\n\nA: The problem is that you're not flushing the PrintWriter after each write.
