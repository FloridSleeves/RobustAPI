You can use a SortedMap though, which can be backed by a Hashtable and has a Comparator.\nQuestion: How to use a custom comparator with a PriorityQueue in Java: : Hi, I'm trying to use a custom comparator with a PriorityQueue in Java.

If the count is null (meaning the word is not in the map), we put the word with a count of 1. If the count is not null, we increment the count by 1 and put the word back into the map.\n\nAs for your Hashtable comparator problem, you can write a comparator like this:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Comparator;\n\npublic class Name implements Comparable<Name"}
