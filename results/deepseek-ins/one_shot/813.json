How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: String line = bufferedReader.readLine();\n<<<explanation>>>: The BufferedReader.readLine() method reads a line of text. It will block until a line is available. In your case, it seems like the BufferedReader is reading all the data from the socket at once, so it's not waiting for a newline character to consider the end of the first line. You should call readLine() in a loop until you get null, which means the end of the stream has been reached.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem.

This way, you can read all the lines sent by the client.\n\n\nA: The problem is that you are not sending newline characters. When you call write(\"1\"), write(\"2\"), and write(\"3\"), you are sending the characters \"1\", \"2\", and \"3\" without any newline characters. When you call readLine(), it reads until it encounters a newline character, which it doesn't find because there are no newline characters in your data.\nYou need to add newline characters (\"\\n\") after each write, like this:\nprintWriter.write(\"1\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\\n\");\n\nThen, in your read loop, you should call readLine() until it returns null, like this:\nString line;\nwhile ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n\nThis will read and print each line separately.\n\nA: You are writing each character separately without a newline character. The BufferedReader.readLine() method reads until it encounters a newline character. If there is no newline character, it waits for more data.\nYou should write each line with a newline character at the end:\nprintWriter.write(\"1\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\\n\");\n\nThen in your read loop, you should call readLine() until it returns null:"}
