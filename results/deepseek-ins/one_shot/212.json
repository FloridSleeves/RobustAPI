It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Any byte >= 128 is received as 65533: :I am implementing a server on Android and I am using:while (!Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) {    try {        int r;        String response = \"\";        while ((r = input.read()) > 0) {        ...        }    ...}I have two issues. If the client sends me a byte of value 0, it is not received by the server. The second issue is, if the byte value is 128 or more, I keep receiving a value of 65533 or a binary value of 11111101.

I am a beginner in networking on JAVA.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: int b = input.read();\n<<<explanation>>>: You are already using the correct method to read a single byte. If you are having issues with bytes less than 128 being read correctly, it could be a problem with how you are sending those bytes from the client. If you are sending bytes as integers, you might need to convert them to bytes before sending.\nFor the second issue, if you are receiving a value of 65533 or a binary value of 11111101, it could be that you are not properly handling the sign bit in your byte. In Java, a byte is signed, which means it can represent both positive and negative numbers. If you are expecting a value between 0 and 127, you should be able to read it as a byte without any issues. If you are expecting a value between -128 and 127, you should be able to read it as a byte without any issues. If you are expecting a value between 128 and 255, you should be able to read it as an unsigned byte. If you are expecting a value between -128 and -1, you should be able to read it as an unsigned byte.\nIf you are still having issues, it would be helpful to see your client code.\n\nA: The first issue is that you are reading one byte at a time, which is slower than reading a larger buffer. You can use the read(byte[] b) method of InputStream to read into a buffer.\n\nThe second issue is that you are reading a byte as an integer, which is not correct. You should read a byte as a byte.\n\nHere is an example of how you can modify your code:\n\n```java\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true) {\n    int b = is.read(buffer, i, buffer.length - i);\n    if (b == -1) {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    i += b;\n\n    if (i == 3) {\n        length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n        break;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code reads into the buffer as much as it can, and then processes the buffer. It will read more data if it can, but it will not read more data than is needed to determine the length.\n\nFor the second issue, you should be able to read a byte as a byte without any issues. If you are still having issues, it would be helpful to see your client code.\n\nPlease note that the read(byte[] b) method is available from Java 1.1. If you are using an older version of Java, you may need to use the read() method and manually process the bytes.\n\nAlso, please note that the read(byte[] b) method will not throw an exception if the end of the stream is reached. Instead, it will return -1, which you should check for to determine if the stream has ended.\n\nI hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\n\nA: The first issue is that you are reading one byte at a time, which is slower than reading a larger buffer.

It will read more data if it can, but it will not read more data than is needed to"}
