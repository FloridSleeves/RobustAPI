It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: How to get Entity at the servlet using MultipartEntity?: :If i Upload a file to my servlet like this:HttpClient httpclient = new DefaultHttpClient();HttpPost httppost = new HttpPost(\"http://www.tumblr.com/api/write\");try {    MultipartEntity entity = new MultipartEntity();    entity.addPart(\"type\", new StringBody(\"photo\"));    entity.addPart(\"data\", new FileBody(image));    httppost.setEntity(entity);    HttpResponse response = httpclient.execute(httppost);} catch (ClientProtocolException e) {} catch (IOException e) {}How can I retrieve the content at the servlet?protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws  IOException {     request.???}I'm using Google App Server as my Servlet API\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: Android InputStream.read() horribly slow:I'm working on an Android app that needs to communicate with a server (running on my PC) which is also written by me.

You can then use the InputStream.read() method to read the content of the request.\n\n\nA: The problem might be that you're reading the input stream one byte at a time, which is inefficient. Instead, you should read the input stream in larger chunks.\n\nYou can use the read(byte[] b) method of the InputStream class, which reads bytes from this input stream into an array. For example:\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\nint bytesRead;\nwhile ((bytesRead = is.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n    // Process the data in the buffer\n}\n\nThis will read up to 1024 bytes at a time, which is more efficient than reading one byte at a time.\n\nAlso, you should check the return value of is.read(buffer) to make sure you're not reading more data than you expect.\n\nFinally, you should close the input stream when you're done with it to free up system resources. You can do this with is.close().\n\nA: The problem might be that you're reading the input stream one byte at a time, which is inefficient.

You can do this with is.close().\n\nA: You can use the Apache HttpComponents library to handle the multipart/form-data. It provides a MultipartEntity and MultipartParser for handling multipart requests and responses.\nHere is an example of how you can use it:\nClient side:\nMultipartEntity entity = new MultipartEntity();\nentity.addPart(\"type\", new StringBody(\"photo\"));\nentity.addPart(\"data\", new FileBody(image));\n\nHttpClient httpclient = new DefaultHttpClient();\nHttpPost httppost = new HttpPost(\"http://www.tumblr.com/api/write\");\nhttppost.setEntity(entity);\n\nHttpResponse response = httpclient.execute(httppost);\n\nServer side:\nprotected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException {\n    MultipartInputStream multi = new MultipartInputStream(request.getInputStream(), \"UTF-8\", 1024 * 1024);\n    Part part = multi.getNextPart();\n    while (part != null) {\n        String contentDisp = part.getContentDisposition();\n        if (contentDisp != null && contentDisp.contains(\"name=\\\"type\\\"\")) {\n            String type = new String(IOUtils.toByteArray(part.getInputStream()), \"UTF-8\");\n            // process type\n        } else if (contentDisp != null && contentDisp.contains(\"name=\\\"data\\\"\")) {\n            byte[] data = IOUtils.toByteArray(part.getInputStream());\n            // process data\n        }\n        part = multi.getNextPart();\n    }\n}\n\nThis way, you can handle multipart/form-data in a more efficient way.\n\nA: I'm not sure if you're still looking for an answer, but I'll provide a solution.\nThe problem might be that you're reading the input stream one byte at a time, which is inefficient.
