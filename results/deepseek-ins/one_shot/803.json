This will make sure that each line you write is on a new line in the file.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.write(\"1\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"2\\n\");\nprintWriter.write(\"3\\n\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem.

How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: try { System.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine()); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The BufferedReader.readLine() method reads a line of text. It returns null if the stream ends. So, if you are calling readLine() immediately after write(), it will return null because the newline character you wrote is not yet in the stream. You should call readLine() in a loop until it returns null.\nQuestion: Java Sockets: Send multiple lines and receive multiple lines [duplicate]:\nI am sending multiple lines to a ServerSocket using a PrintWriter.\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\nThen I am trying to receive it with a BufferedReader\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\nI am of course closing all the resources, I wrote this code only to visualize the problem.

How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.println.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.println\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.println(\"1\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The PrintWriter.println() method writes a line terminated by a line separator. The line separator string is defined by the system property line.separator, and is not necessarily a single newline ('\\n') character. This is why you are seeing 123 instead of 1. To fix this, you should use PrintWriter.println() instead of PrintWriter.write().\n\n\nA: The problem is that you're not sending newline characters (\\n) between your lines of text. The BufferedReader.readLine() method reads until it encounters a newline character, so it's reading all of your data as a single line.\nYou should use PrintWriter.println() instead of PrintWriter.write() to send each line separately. This will automatically append a newline character to each line.\nHere's how you can do it:\nPrintWriter printWriter = ...\nprintWriter.println(\"1\");\nprintWriter.println(\"2\");\nprintWriter.println(\"3\");\n\nAnd then in your server code:\nServerSocket serverSocket = ...\nSocket socket = serverSocket.accept();\nBufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nSystem.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());\n\nThis will print \"1\" because readLine() reads until it encounters a newline character.\n\nA: You are using PrintWriter.write() which writes the string as is. It does not append a newline character. So when you read the data using BufferedReader.readLine(), it reads until it encounters a newline character, which is not present in your case"}
