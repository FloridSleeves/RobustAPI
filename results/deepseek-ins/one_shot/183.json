It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Getting values of checkboxes along with uploading the file: :I was trying to upload an image in java using commonsIO  and Jar for file upload.But the problem am facing is that i am having two checkboxes on my form as follow : <div style=\"float:left\">  <input name=\"Mcheckbox\" type=\"checkbox\" value=\"Mobile\"/>  Mobile</div><div style=\"float:right\">  <input name=\"Echechkbox\" type=\"checkbox\" value=\"Email\"/>  Email</div>And then browse option : Upload Image : <INPUT TYPE=\"file\" NAME=\"file\" value=\"file\"></input>And in my servlet am doing something like this : ServletFileUpload upload = new ServletFileUpload(new DiskFileItemFactory());List<FileItem> files = new ServletFileUpload(new DiskFileItemFactory()).parseRequest(request);Iterator it = files.iterator();And then: while (it.hasNext()) {    FileItem fi = (FileItem) it.next();    if (fi.isFormField()) {        if (fieldname.compareTo(\"Mcheckbox\") == 0) {            System.out.println(\"checkbox value is \" + fieldvalue);            mymobilepass = fieldvalue;        } else if (fieldname.compareTo(\"Echeckbox\") == 0) {            System.out.println(\"checkbox value is \" + fieldvalue);            myemailpass = fieldvalue;        }    } else {        InputStream is = fi.getInputStream();        FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(path + \"\\\\\" + fi.getName());        int x = is.read();        while (x >= 0) {            fos.write((byte) x);            x = is.read();            //System.out.println(\"reading\");        }    }}But am getting null as the value of myemailpass or mymobilepass everytime.What can be the reason ?

If you are trying to read the entire InputStream into a byte array, you should use a ByteArrayOutputStream instead.
