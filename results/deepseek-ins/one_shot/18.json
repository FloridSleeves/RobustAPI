I am confused how does it work? why doesn't it give error just like we get in java code? and most importantly, how does environment decide to which component it needs to invoke? I understand the process of id generation is automated, which gets added to R.java For instance, if we have same IDs, say \"image1\" in two XMLs, say \"layout1\" & \"layout2\". but in R.java it won't have 2 IDs. that means at a time it will reference only 1 component. In case we have to use 2 XMLs in an Activity, one as activity.setcontentview(layout1) and another as a PopupWindow.setContentView(layout2). What will happen in such case?\n\nThe Android system automatically generates unique IDs for each resource in your application. When you define an ID in an XML layout file, the Android build process generates a corresponding integer constant in the R.java file. If you define the same ID in two different XML files, the build process will generate the same integer constant for both.\n\nIn your case, if you have the same ID in two XML files, say \"image1\" in \"layout1\" and \"layout2\", the R.java file will have the same integer constant for both IDs. This means that when you call findViewById(R.id.image1), the system will return the view associated with the ID in the current view hierarchy.\n\nIf you want to use the same ID in two different layouts, you need to define it in a separate XML file and include it in your layouts using the <include> tag. For example:\n\n```xml\n<!-- layout1.xml -->\n<RelativeLayout xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\n    android:id=\"+layout1\"\n    android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n    android:layout_height=\"match_parent\">\n\n    <ImageView\n        android:id=\"@+id/image1\"\n        android:layout_width=\"wrap_content\"\n        android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"\n        android:src=\"@drawable/image1\" />\n\n    <!-- other views -->\n\n</RelativeLayout>\n\n<!-- layout2.xml -->\n<RelativeLayout xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\n    android:id=\"+layout2\"\n    android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n    android:layout_height=\"match_parent\">\n\n    <ImageView\n        android:id=\"@+id/image1\"\n        android:layout_width=\"wrap_content\"\n        android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"\n        android:src=\"@drawable/image2\" />\n\n    <!-- other views -->\n\n</RelativeLayout>\n```\n\nThen, in your activity, you can use setContentView() to switch between these layouts:\n\n```java\nsetContentView(R.layout.layout1);\n```\n\nor\n\n```java\nsetContentView(R.layout.layout2);\n```\n\nThis way, the system will generate unique IDs for each view in each layout, and you can use findViewById() to get the views by their IDs.\n\n\nQuestion: TextVisibility change after a period of time: :, I have just started learning java for android, I have set the TextVisibility of a textfield to GONE, I need the TextVisibilty to change to VISIBLE after 7 seconds from Button click, I had searched the internet and could not find anything useful or I could'nt understand.
