I guess I know how to create the base string, and I assume I'm supposed to use 'OAuth Consumer Secret' that Google have assigned to my app as the key.But what am I supposed to do with these two to obtain the signature? Is there any HMAC-class on GAE/Java?Would it play if I just stored somewhere what OAuth Playground generates for me? Is it how you do it? Or does OAuth signature have some expiration date?(I tried AuthSub before but failed too, even though it looks quite simple. Also OAuth seems like more 'standard' to me, so I'd like to stick with OAuth.)\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.

The bytes are encoded in the platform's default character encoding.\nQuestion: How to get the current date and time in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: java.util.Date\n<<<code>>>: Date date = new Date();\n<<<explanation>>>: The Date class represents a specific instant in time, with millisecond precision. It is used to get the current date and time.\nQuestion: How to get the current date and time in Java 8?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: java.time.LocalDateTime\n<<<code>>>: LocalDateTime now = LocalDateTime.now();\n<<<explanation>>>: The LocalDateTime class represents a date and time without a timezone. It is used to get the current date and time.\nQuestion: How to get the current date in Java 8?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: java.time.LocalDate\n<<<code>>>: LocalDate today = LocalDate.now();\n<<<explanation>>>: The LocalDate class represents a date (year, month, day) without a time. It is used to get the current date.\nQuestion: How to get the current time in Java 8?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: java.time.LocalTime\n<<<code>>>: LocalTime now = LocalTime.now();\n<<<explanation>>>: The LocalTime class represents a time (hour, minute, second, and nanoseconds) without a date. It is used to get the current time.\nQuestion: How to convert a string to a date in Java 8?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: java.time.LocalDate.parse\n<<<code>>>: LocalDate date = LocalDate.parse(\"2014-03-15\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The parse() method of the LocalDate class returns an instance of LocalDate from a text string such as \"2014-03-15\".\nQuestion: How to convert a date to a string in Java 8?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter.format\n<<<code>>>: DateTimeFormatter formatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(\"yyyy-MM-dd\");\nLocalDate date = LocalDate.now();\nString formattedDate = date.format(formatter);\n<<<explanation>>>: The format() method of the LocalDate class returns a formatted string using the specified formatter. The ofPattern() method of the DateTimeFormatter class returns a formatter that formats or parses a textual representation of a date.\nQuestion: How to add days to a date in Java 8?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: java.time.LocalDate.plusDays\n<<<code>>>: LocalDate tomorrow = today.plusDays(1);\n<<<explanation>>>: The plusDays() method of the LocalDate class adds the specified number of days to this date and returns a new date.\nQuestion: How to subtract days from a date in Java 8?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: java.time.LocalDate.minusDays\n<<<code>>>: LocalDate yesterday = today.minusDays(1);\n<<<explanation>>>: The minusDays() method of the LocalDate class subtracts the specified number of days from this date and returns a new date.\nQuestion: How to add months to a date in Java 8?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: java.time.LocalDate.plusMonths\n<<<code>>>: LocalDate nextMonth = today.plusMonths(1);\n<<<explanation>>>: The plusMonths() method of the LocalDate class adds the specified number of months to this date and returns a new date.\nQuestion: How to subtract months from a date in Java 8?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: java.time.LocalDate.minusMonths\n<<<code>>>: LocalDate lastMonth = today.minusMonths(1);\n<<<explanation>>>: The minusMonths() method of the LocalDate class subtracts the specified number of months from this date and returns a new date.\nQuestion: How to add years to a date in Java 8?\n"}
