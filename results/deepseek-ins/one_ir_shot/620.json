This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\n\nIn the code snippet above, we first create an array of integers. Then we use the Arrays.stream() method to convert the array into a Stream. The sum() method is then called on the Stream to calculate the sum of its elements. The result is stored in the variable 'sum'.\n\nPlease note that Arrays.stream() is available from Java 8 onwards. If you're using an older version of Java, you'll need to use a different approach, such as a for-each loop or the traditional for loop.\n\nI hope this helps. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask.\n\n\nA: You can use the Arrays.stream method in Java 8 and later to create a Stream from the array, then use the sum method on the Stream to calculate the sum of the elements in the array. Here is an example:\n\n```java\nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, "}
