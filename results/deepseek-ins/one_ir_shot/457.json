What is the cleanest/best way to go about it?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: Set<String> set = new HashSet<String>();\nIterator<String> iterator = set.iterator();\nEnumeration<String> enumeration = new Enumeration<String>() {\n    @Override\n    public boolean hasMoreElements() {\n        return iterator.hasNext();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String nextElement() {\n        return iterator.next();\n    }\n};\n<<<explanation>>>: The Enumeration interface is a legacy interface that has been replaced by Iterator. However, since you are required to return an Enumeration<String>, we can create an anonymous class that implements Enumeration<String> and uses the Iterator to iterate over the Set<String>. The hasMoreElements() method checks if there are more elements in the Set, and the nextElement() method returns the next element.\nQuestion: How can I create a new array from an existing array in Java?\nPlease using this api: System.arraycopy.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: System.arraycopy\n<<<code>>>: int[] oldArray = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint[] newArray = new int[oldArray.length];\nSystem.arraycopy(oldArray, 0, newArray, 0, oldArray.length);\n<<<explanation>>>: The System.arraycopy() method copies the specified number of elements from the source array to the destination array. The source array is copied from the position specified by the fromIndex parameter, and the destination array is copied to the position specified by the toIndex parameter. The number of elements to copy is specified by the length parameter.\nQuestion: How can I sort a list of integers in Java?\nPlease using this api: Collections.sort.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Collections.sort\n<<<code>>>: List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(5, 2, 1, 4, 3);\nCollections.sort(list);\n<<<explanation>>>: The Collections.sort() method sorts the elements in the specified list into ascending order. The sort is not stable, i.e., equal elements may not preserve their relative order. The list is sorted using its iterator, so it is modified during the call.\nQuestion: How can I find the maximum value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint max = Arrays.stream(array).max().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The max() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalInt that represents the maximum element of this stream. If the stream is empty, the result is an empty Optional. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation. The getAsInt() method returns the value of this OptionalInt, if it is present, otherwise it throws NoSuchElementException.\nQuestion: How can I find the minimum value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint min = Arrays.stream(array).min().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The min() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalInt that represents the minimum element of this stream. If the stream is empty, the result is an empty Optional. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation. The getAsInt() method returns the value of this OptionalInt, if it is present, otherwise it throws NoSuchElementException.\nQuestion: How can I find the average of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\ndouble average = Arrays.stream(array).average().getAsDouble();\n<<<explanation>>>: The average() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalDouble that represents the average of the elements of this stream. If the stream is empty, the result is an empty Optional. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation"}
