It returns a Cursor that contains the result of the query. The selection argument is a WHERE clause in the form of a SQL WHERE clause that must begin with the column name, followed by the operator, and then the value. The selectionArgs are the values that replace the ? in the WHERE clause.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\n\n\nA: Your question is a bit unclear, but I'll try to answer it.\n\nHow can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\n\nYou can use the Arrays.stream API in Java 8 and later. Here's an example:\n\n```java\nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n```\n\nIn this code, `Arrays.stream(array)` creates a stream from the array, and `sum()` is a terminal operation that calculates the sum of the elements in the stream. The result is stored in the `sum` variable.\n\nIf you're using an older version of Java that doesn't support streams, you can use a for-each loop to calculate the sum:\n\n```java\nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = 0;\nfor (int num : array) {\n    sum += num;\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, the"}
