This is a intermediate operation.\nThe Comparator.comparing() method takes a function that extracts a Comparable key from the object, and returns a Comparator that compares by that key.\nQuestion: How can I find the maximum value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint max = Arrays.stream(array).max().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The max() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalInt that represents the maximum element of this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation. The getAsInt() method returns the value of this OptionalInt, if it is present, otherwise throws NoSuchElementException.\nQuestion: How can I find the minimum value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint min = Arrays.stream(array).min().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The min() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalInt that represents the minimum element of this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation. The getAsInt() method returns the value of this OptionalInt, if it is present, otherwise throws NoSuchElementException.\n\n\nA: Here are the answers to your questions:\n\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nAnswer: You can use the Arrays.stream API.\n\n```java\nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n```\n\nExplanation: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\n\nQuestion: Iterate NavigableSet without having entrySet() available:\nAnswer: You can use the Iterator.next API.\n\n```java\nNavigableSet nset = news.descendingKeySet();\nIterator<String> iterator = nset.iterator();\nwhile(iterator.hasNext()){\n    String value = iterator.next();\n    out.println(value + \"<br>\");\n}\n```\n\nExplanation: The next() method of the Iterator interface returns the next element in the iteration. This is a terminal operation.\n\nQuestion: How can I sort a list of objects by a specific property in Java?\nAnswer: You can use the Streams API.\n\n```java\nList<MyObject> list = ...;\nlist.stream()\n    .sorted(Comparator.comparing(MyObject::getPropertyName))\n    .collect(Collectors.toList());\n```\n\nExplanation: The sorted() method of the Stream interface returns a stream consisting of the elements of this stream, sorted according to the provided Comparator. This is a intermediate operation.\nThe Comparator.comparing() method takes a function that extracts a Comparable key from the object, and returns a Comparator that compares by that key.\n\nQuestion: How can I find"}
