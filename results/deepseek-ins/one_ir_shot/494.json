If not, add the record to the masterList.For each Record in masterList, check if it's in updatedIds. If not, it is obsolete, so remove it from masterList.The straightforward code for this is as follows:for (Integer updId : updatedIds) {    boolean hasMapping = false;    for (Record rec : masterList) {        if (rec.getId() == updId) { hasMapping = true; break; }    }    if (!hasMapping) {        //TODO add updId to masterList    }}for (Record rec : masterList) {    boolean isObsolete = true;    for (Integer updId : updatedIds) {        if (rec.getId() == updId) { isObsolete = false; break; }    }    if (isObsolete) {        //TODO remove rec from masterList    }}The first loop takes care of requirement 1, the second takes care of requirement 2.

The iterator.remove() method removes from the underlying collection the last element returned by this iterator. This is a terminal operation that may throw exceptions.\nQuestion: How can I convert a List of Objects to a List of Primitives?\nPlease using this api: Streams.map.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Streams.map\n<<<code>>>: List<Integer> intList = objList.stream().map(obj -> (Integer) obj).collect(Collectors.toList());\n<<<explanation>>>: The map() method is a terminal operation that returns a result that is a Stream consisting of the results of applying the given function to the elements of this stream. This is a special case of a map operation. This is a intermediate operation.\nQuestion: How can I sort a list of objects by a specific property using Java 8?\nPlease using this api: Streams.sorted.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Streams.sorted\n<<<code>>>: List<Person> sortedList = people.stream().sorted(Comparator.comparing(Person::getAge)).collect(Collectors.toList());\n<<<explanation>>>: The sorted() method is a terminal operation that returns a result that is a Stream consisting of the elements of this stream, sorted according to the provided Comparator. This is a intermediate operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the maximum value in a list of integers in Java 8?\nPlease using this api: Streams.max.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Streams.max\n<<<code>>>: Optional<Integer> max = intList.stream().max(Integer::compareTo);\n<<<explanation>>>: The max() method is a terminal operation that returns an Optional describing the maximum element of this stream, or an empty Optional if the stream is empty. This is a intermediate operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the minimum value in a list of integers in Java 8?\nPlease using this api: Streams.min.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Streams.min\n<<<code>>>: Optional<Integer> min = intList.stream().min(Integer::compareTo);\n<<<explanation>>>: The min() method is a terminal operation that returns an Optional describing the minimum element of this stream, or an empty Optional if the stream is empty. This is a intermediate operation.\nQuestion: How can I count the number of elements in a list in Java 8?\nPlease using this api: Streams.count.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Streams.count\n<<<code>>>: long count = list.stream().count();\n<<<explanation>>>: The count() method is a terminal operation that returns the count of elements in this stream. This is a intermediate operation.\nQuestion: How can I filter a list in Java 8?\nPlease using this api: Streams.filter.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Streams.filter\n<<<code>>>: List<Integer> filteredList = list.stream().filter(i -> i > 5).collect(Collectors.toList());\n<<<explanation>>>: The filter() method is a intermediate operation that returns a Stream consisting of the elements of this stream that match the given predicate. This is a intermediate operation.\nQuestion: How can I map a list in Java 8?\nPlease using this api: Streams.map.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Streams.map\n<<<code>>>: List<Integer> mappedList = list.stream().map(i -> i * 2).collect(Collectors.toList());\n<<<explanation>>>: The map() method is a terminal operation that returns"}
