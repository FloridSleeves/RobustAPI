Why?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: int b = in.read();\n<<<explanation>>>: The read() method of the InputStream class returns the next byte of data, or -1 if the end of the stream has been reached. In the case of a byte array input stream, the bytes are read from the array by position. When the last byte has been read, subsequent read() calls will return -1.\nQuestion: What is the difference between the Java 8's Optional and Guava's Optional?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Java 8's Optional and Guava's Optional\n<<<code>>>: \nJava 8's Optional:\nOptional<String> optional = Optional.ofNullable(str);\n<<<explanation>>>: Java 8's Optional is a container object which may or may not contain a non-null value. It's used to avoid null references and to make your code more robust.\n\nGuava's Optional:\ncom.google.common.base.Optional<String> optional = com.google.common.base.Optional.fromNullable(str);\n<<<explanation>>>: Guava's Optional is a more powerful version of Java 8's Optional. It provides additional methods for dealing with absent values and can be used in conjunction with Java 8's Optional.\n\nQuestion: What is the difference between the Java 8's Stream and Guava's Stream?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Java 8's Stream and Guava's Stream\n<<<code>>>: \nJava 8's Stream:\nStream<String> stream = list.stream();\n<<<explanation>>>: Java 8's Stream is a sequence of elements supporting sequential and parallel aggregate operations. It's used for functional-style operations on collections.\n\nGuava's Stream:\nStreams.stream(list)\n<<<explanation>>>: Guava's Stream is a more powerful version of Java 8's Stream. It provides additional methods for dealing with collections and can be used in conjunction with Java 8's Stream.\n\nQuestion: What is the difference between the Java 8's CompletableFuture and Guava's ListenableFuture?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Java 8's CompletableFuture and Guava's ListenableFuture\n<<<code>>>: \nJava 8's CompletableFuture:\nCompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> computeSomething());\n<<<explanation>>>: Java 8's CompletableFuture is a new interface that provides a rich set of methods for asynchronous computation. It's used for non-blocking computation and can be used in conjunction with Java 8's Future.\n\nGuava's ListenableFuture:\nListeningExecutorService executorService = MoreExecutors.listeningDecorator(Executors.newFixedThreadPool(1));\nListenableFuture<String> future = executorService.submit(new Callable<String>() {\n    public String call() {\n        return computeSomething();\n    }\n});\n<<<explanation>>>: Guava's ListenableFuture is a more powerful version of Java 8's Future.
