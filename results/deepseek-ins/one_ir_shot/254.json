The number of bytes read is returned as an integer. The read method returns -1 when the end of the stream is reached. The read method may read fewer bytes than the length of the buffer if no more bytes are available. This method blocks until some input is available.\nQuestion: How can I sort a list of objects in Java?\nPlease using this api: Collections.sort.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Collections.sort\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nList<Object> list = new ArrayList<>();\nCollections.sort(list);\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: The sort() method of the Collections class sorts the specified list into ascending order. The sort is not stable, i.e., equal elements may not preserve their relative order. The sort is not guaranteed to be stable unless it is implemented by a class that is serializable.\nQuestion: How can I read a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: FileInputStream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileInputStream\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nFile file = new File(\"path/to/file\");\nFileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(file);\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: The FileInputStream class obtains input bytes from a file in a file system. What files are available for input depends on the underlying file system.\nQuestion: How can I write to a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: FileOutputStream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileOutputStream\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nFile file = new File(\"path/to/file\");\nFileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(file);\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: The FileOutputStream class is the write counterpart of the FileInputStream class. It is used for writing data to a file. The constructors of this class assume that the default encoding is always UTF-8.\nQuestion: How can I read a file line by line in Java?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nFile file = new File(\"path/to/file\");\nFileReader fr = new FileReader(file);\nBufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);\nString line;\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\nbr.close();\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: The BufferedReader class in Java is used to read the data from the character-input stream. It makes the performance fast by buffering characters. The BufferedReader class in Java is used for buffering characters. It makes the performance fast by buffering characters. The BufferedReader class in Java is used for buffering characters. It makes the performance fast by buffering characters.\n```\n\nI hope this helps.
