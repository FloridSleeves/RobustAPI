The TIFF header has been replace by a specific one but the image bytes are exactly the same as in a TIFF file.EDIT :Thanks to haraldK, I can finally create a TIFF header. But I can't open the image, maybe it is because of the compression : \"M2 = Modified Read Code II (MRII), i.e., fax group 4\".

The new thread begins execution of a separate callable target.\nQuestion: How can I create a new object in Java?\nPlease using this api: new.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: new\n<<<code>>>: Object obj = new Object();\n<<<explanation>>>: The new keyword in Java is used to create an instance of a class. It is used to allocate memory for a new object and invoke the class constructor.\nQuestion: How can I create a new array in Java?\nPlease using this api: new.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: new\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = new int[5];\n<<<explanation>>>: The new keyword in Java is used to create an instance of a class. It is used to allocate memory for a new object and invoke the class constructor. In this case, we are creating a new array of integers with a length of 5.\nQuestion: How can I create a new list in Java?\nPlease using this api: new.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: new\n<<<code>>>: List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();\n<<<explanation>>>: The new keyword in Java is used to create an instance of a class. It is used to allocate memory for a new object and invoke the class constructor. In this case, we are creating a new ArrayList of Strings.\nQuestion: How can I create a new map in Java?\nPlease using this api: new.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: new\n<<<code>>>: Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();\n<<<explanation>>>: The new keyword in Java is used to create an instance of a class. It is used to allocate memory for a new object and invoke the class constructor. In this case, we are creating a new HashMap with keys of type String and values of type Integer.\nQuestion: How can I create a new set in Java?\nPlease using this api: new.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: new\n<<<code>>>: Set<String> set = new HashSet<>();\n<<<explanation>>>: The new keyword in Java is used to create an instance of a class.
