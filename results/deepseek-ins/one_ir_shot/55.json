This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\n\n\nA: The error you're seeing is a java.util.NoSuchElementException, which is thrown by the Scanner class when it attempts to read from the stream and there are no more tokens available.\nIn your code, you're creating a new Scanner for each line read from the file, but you're not closing it after each line. This can cause issues if the line contains more tokens than you expect.\nHere's a corrected version of your code:\npublic RecordManager(){\n    int pos;\n    String athlete, record, country, raceTime;\n    try {\n        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"resultdata.txt\"));\n        String line;\n        while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n            Scanner sc = new Scanner(line).useDelimiter(\"#\");\n            athlete = sc.next();\n            country = sc.next();\n            pos = sc.nextInt();\n            record = sc.next();\n            raceTime = sc.next();\n            sc.close();\n            if(\"WRC\".equals(record)){\n                resultArr[size] = new WorldRecord(athlete, country, pos, raceTime);\n            }\n            else if(\"OLR\".equals(record)){\n                resultArr[size] = new OlympicRecord(athlete, country, pos, raceTime);\n            }\n            else{\n                resultArr[size] = new RaceResult(athlete, country, pos, raceTime);\n            }\n            size++;\n        }\n        br.close();\n    } catch (FileNotFoundException ex) {\n        Logger.getLogger(RecordManager.class.getName()).log(Level.SEVERE, null, ex);\n    }\n}\n\nIn this version, I've added a BufferedReader to read the file line by line. I've also added a call to sc.close() after processing each line, which closes the Scanner and releases its resources. Finally, I've added a call to br.close() after the while loop, which closes the BufferedReader and releases its resources.\n\nA: The error is caused by the fact that you are not closing the Scanner sc after each line. This can cause issues if the line contains more tokens than you expect.\nHere is the corrected code:\npublic RecordManager(){\n    int pos;\n    String athlete, record, country, raceTime;\n    try {\n        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"resultdata.txt\"));\n        String line;\n        while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n            Scanner sc = new Scanner(line).useDelimiter(\"#\");\n            athlete = sc.next();\n            country = sc.next();\n            pos = sc.nextInt();\n            record = sc.next();\n            raceTime = sc.next();\n            sc.close();\n            if(\"WRC\".equals(record)){\n                resultArr[size] = new WorldRecord(athlete, country, pos, raceTime);\n            }\n            else if(\"OLR\".equals(record)){\n                resultArr[size] = new OlympicRecord(athlete, country, pos, raceTime);\n            }\n            else{\n                resultArr[size] = new RaceResult(athlete, country, pos, raceTime);\n            }\n            size++;\n       "}
