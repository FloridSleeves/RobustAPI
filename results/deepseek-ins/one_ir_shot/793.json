This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to get the current date and time in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: java.time.LocalDateTime.now()\n<<<code>>>: LocalDateTime now = LocalDateTime.now();\nSystem.out.println(now);\n<<<explanation>>>: The now() method of the LocalDateTime class returns the current date and time. This is a non-terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to convert a string to an integer in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Integer.parseInt()\n<<<code>>>: String str = \"123\";\nint num = Integer.parseInt(str);\n<<<explanation>>>: The parseInt() method of the Integer class returns the int value represented by the specified String. This is a static method and does not need an object to be called.\nQuestion: How to convert a string to a double in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Double.parseDouble()\n<<<code>>>: String str = \"123.45\";\ndouble num = Double.parseDouble(str);\n<<<explanation>>>: The parseDouble() method of the Double class returns the double value represented by the specified String. This is a static method and does not need an object to be called.\nQuestion: How to convert an integer to a string in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Integer.toString()\n<<<code>>>: int num = 123;\nString str = Integer.toString(num);\n<<<explanation>>>: The toString() method of the Integer class returns a String object representing the specified integer. This is a static method and does not need an object to be called.\nQuestion: How to convert a double to a string in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Double.toString()\n<<<code>>>: double num = 123.45;\nString str = Double.toString(num);\n<<<explanation>>>: The toString() method of the Double class returns a String object representing the specified double. This is a static method and does not need an object to be called.\nQuestion: How to create a new file in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: new FileOutputStream\n<<<code>>>: FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(\"newfile.txt\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The FileOutputStream class represents an output stream of bytes to a file in a file system. This is a subclass of the OutputStream class.\nQuestion: How to write to a file in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>: FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(\"newfile.txt\");\nfos.write(\"Hello, World!\".getBytes());\nfos.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The write() method of the FileOutputStream class writes b.length bytes from the specified byte array to this file output stream. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to read from a file in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileInputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(\"existingfile.txt\");\nint content;\nwhile ((content = fis.read()) != -1) {\n    System.out.print((char) content);\n}\nfis.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The read() method of the FileInputStream class reads the next byte of data from the input stream. This is a non-terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to delete a file in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: File.delete\n<<<code>>>: File file = new File(\"existingfile.txt\");\nfile.delete();\n<<<explanation>>>: The delete() method of the File class deletes the file denoted by this abstract pathname. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to check if a file exists in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: File.exists\n<<<code>>>: File file = new File(\"existingfile.txt\");\nif (file.exists()) {\n    System.out.println(\"File exists\");\n} else {\n    System.out.println(\"File"}
