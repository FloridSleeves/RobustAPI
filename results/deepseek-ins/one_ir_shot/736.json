Here is an example:\n\n```python\narray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\ntotal = sum(array)\n```\n\nIn this example, the sum() function takes an iterable (in this case, the array) and returns the sum of its elements.\n\nQuestion: How can I print a 2D array to a file in Python?\nAnswer: You can use the built-in open() function to open a file and write to it. Here is an example:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Create a 2D array\ndvorana = np.random.randint(0, 3, (5, 5))\n\n# Open a file for writing\nwith open('dvorana.txt', 'w') as file:\n    # Iterate over the rows of the array\n    for row in dvorana:\n        # Convert each row to a string and write it to the file\n        file.write(' '.join(map(str, row)) + '\\n')\n```\n\nIn this example, the open() function opens a file named 'dvorana.txt' for writing. The 'w' argument means that the file will be opened for writing, and any existing content will be deleted. The with statement is used to ensure that the file is properly closed after it is no longer needed. The ' '.join() function is used to convert each row of the array to a string, and the map() function is used to convert each element of the row to a string. The '\\n' character is used to separate the rows in the file.\n```\n\n```javascript\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in JavaScript?\nAnswer: The sum of an array in JavaScript can be calculated using the reduce() method. Here is an example:\n\n```javascript\nlet array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nlet sum = array.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);\n```\n\nIn this example, the reduce() method takes a function (a, b) => a + b, which adds together the elements of the array, and a starting value of 0. The result is the sum of the elements in the array.\n\nQuestion: How can I print a 2D array to a file in JavaScript?\nAnswer: You can use the FileSaver.js library to save a file in JavaScript. Here is an example:\n\n```javascript\nimport { saveAs } from 'file-saver';\n\n// Create a 2D array\nlet dvorana = Array.from({ length: 5 }, () => Array.from({ length: 5 }, () => Math.floor(Math."}
