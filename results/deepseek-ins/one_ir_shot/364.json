I currently have an iterator that starts at the head:public Iterator<E> iterator( ){    return new ListIterator();}All I have for the other one is:public Iterator<E> iterator(int x ){    return new ListIterator();}I'm not sure how to go about utilizing the given position(x) that won't affect my ListIterator constructor which starts at head. I tried using a for loop to get to \"x\" but realized that wouldn't tell the iterator to start there, so I'm quite stumped. Edit:public ListIterator()        {            current = head; // head in the enclosing list        }\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.

In this case, we are using it to move the iterator to the desired position.\nQuestion: How to sort a list in Java using a comparator?\nPlease using this api: Collections.sort.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Collections.sort\n<<<code>>>: Collections.sort(list, comparator);\n<<<explanation>>>: The sort() method of the Collections class sorts the elements in the list according to the order induced by the specified comparator.\nQuestion: How to create a new list from a subset of another list?\nPlease using this api: Streams.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Streams\n<<<code>>>: List<String> sublist = originalList.stream()\n    .filter(s -> s.length() > 5)\n    .collect(Collectors.toList());\n<<<explanation>>>: The filter() method of the Stream interface returns a stream consisting of the elements that match the given predicate. In this case, we are filtering out strings that are not longer than 5 characters. The collect() method then collects the elements of the stream into a new list.\nQuestion: How to find the maximum value in a list in Java?\nPlease using this api: Collections.max.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Collections.max\n<<<code>>>: int max = Collections.max(list);\n<<<explanation>>>: The max() method of the Collections class returns the maximum element in the list according to the natural ordering of its elements.\nQuestion: How to find the minimum value in a list in Java?\nPlease using this api: Collections.min.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Collections.min\n<<<code>>>: int min = Collections.min(list);\n<<<explanation>>>: The min() method of the Collections class returns the minimum element in the list according to the natural ordering of its elements.\nQuestion: How to reverse a list in Java?\nPlease using this api: Collections.reverse.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Collections.reverse\n<<<code>>>: Collections.reverse(list);\n<<<explanation>>>: The reverse() method of the Collections class reverses the order of the elements in the list.\nQuestion: How to check if a list contains a specific element?\nPlease using this api: List.contains.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: List.contains\n<<<code>>>: boolean contains = list.contains(element);\n<<<explanation>>>: The contains() method of the List interface returns true if the list contains the specified element. Otherwise, it returns false.\nQuestion: How to remove a specific element from a list?\nPlease using this api: List.remove.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: List.remove\n<<<code>>>: list.remove(element);\n<<<explanation>>>: The remove() method of the List interface removes the first occurrence of the specified element from the list, if it is present.\nQuestion: How to clear a list in Java?\nPlease using this api: List.clear.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: List.clear\n<<<code>>>: list.clear();\n<<<explanation>>>: The clear() method of the List interface removes all of the elements from the list.\nQuestion: How to find the length of a list in Java?\nPlease using this api: List.size.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: List.size\n<<<code>>>: int length = list.size();\n<<<explanation>>>: The size() method of the List interface returns the number of elements in the list.\nQuestion: How to check if a list is empty in Java?\nPlease using this api: List.isEmpty.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: List.isEmpty\n<<<code>>>: boolean isEmpty = list.isEmpty();\n<<<explanation>>>: The isEmpty() method of the List interface returns true if the list contains no elements.\nQuestion: How to add an element to the end of a list in Java?\nPlease using this api: List.add.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: List.add\n<<<code>>>: list.add(element"}
