I'm trying to modify the text from testfile.txt and write it to a new file named mdemarco.txt. The modification I'm trying to do is add a line number in front of each line. Does anybody know a way to maybe write the contents of the while loop to a string while it runs and output the resulting string to mdemarco.txt or anything like that?public class Writefile{public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException{  try  {     Scanner file = new Scanner(new File(\"testfile.txt\"));     File output = new File(\"mdemarco.txt\");     String s = \"\";     String b = \"\";     int n = 0;     while(file.hasNext())     {        s = file.nextLine();        n++;        System.out.println(n+\". \"+s);        b = (n+\". \"+s);     }//end while     PrintWriter printer = new PrintWriter(output);     printer.println(b);     printer.close();  }//end try     catch(FileNotFoundException fnfe)  {     System.out.println(\"Was not able to locate testfile.txt.\");  }}//end main}//end classThe input file text is:doremefa solatedoAnd the output I'm getting is only8. doCan anybody help?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.

You should open the PrintWriter outside the while loop and append to it in each iteration. Here is the corrected code:\npublic class Writefile {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        try {\n            Scanner file = new Scanner(new File(\"testfile.txt\"));\n            File output = new File(\"mdemarco.txt\");\n            PrintWriter printer = new PrintWriter(output);\n            String s = \"\";\n            int n = 0;\n            while (file.hasNext()) {\n                s = file.nextLine();\n                n++;\n                System.out.println(n + \". \" + s);\n                printer.println(n + \". \" + s); // append to the file\n            }\n            printer.close();\n        } catch (FileNotFoundException fnfe) {\n            System.out.println(\"Was not able to locate testfile.txt.\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThis code will append each line of the input file with its line number to the output file.\n\nA: Here is the corrected code:\npublic class Writefile {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        try {\n            Scanner file = new Scanner(new File(\"testfile.txt\"));\n            File output = new File(\"mdemarco.txt\");\n            PrintWriter printer = new PrintWriter(output);\n            String s = \"\";\n            int n = 0;\n            while (file.hasNext()) {\n                s = file.nextLine();\n                n++;\n                System.out.println(n + \". \" + s);\n                printer.println(n + \". \" + s); // append to the file\n            }\n            printer.close();\n        } catch (FileNotFoundException fnfe) {\n            System.out.println(\"Was not able to locate testfile.txt.\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nIn this code, the PrintWriter is opened before the while loop. Inside the loop, each line of the input file is printed with its line number and also written to the output file. After the while loop, the PrintWriter is closed. This way, all lines from the input file are written to the output file with their line numbers.\n\nA: Here is the corrected code:\npublic class Writefile{\n    public static void main(String[] args)"}
