If the character is a newline then the line is flushed and the underlying output stream is flushed if it is necessary to write the newline character(s). The write(int c) method of the Writer class is equivalent to the write(char[] c, int off, int len) method with a character array of length one. The newline character(s) are written out.\nQuestion: How to sort a list of objects in Java?\nPlease using this api: Collections.sort.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Collections.sort\n<<<code>>>: \nList<Person> persons = new ArrayList<>();\n// add persons to the list\nCollections.sort(persons, new Comparator<Person>() {\n    @Override\n    public int compare(Person p1, Person p2) {\n        return p1.getName().compareTo(p2.getName());\n    }\n});\n<<<explanation>>>: The sort() method of the Collections class sorts the specified list into ascending order, according to the natural ordering of its elements. The sort is not stable, i.e., equal elements may not preserve their relative order.\nQuestion: How to create a new thread in Java?\nPlease using this api: Thread.start.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Thread.start\n<<<code>>>: \nThread thread = new Thread(new Runnable() {\n    @Override\n    public void run() {\n        // do something\n    }\n});\nthread.start();\n<<<explanation>>>: The start() method of the Thread class causes the thread to begin execution; the Java Virtual Machine calls the run method of the Thread class. The result is that two threads are running concurrently: the current thread (which returns from the call to the start method) and the thread that this method started.\nQuestion: How to convert a List to an Array in Java?\nPlease using this api: List.toArray.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: List.toArray\n<<<code>>>: \nList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();\n// add elements to the list\nString[] array = list.toArray(new String[0]);\n<<<explanation>>>: The toArray() method of the List interface returns an array containing all of the elements in this list in proper sequence (from first to last element). The returned array will be of type Object[], if no parameter is passed to toArray(). If a parameter is passed to toArray(), it will be used as the initial size of the array.\n```\n\n## Answers:\n\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nAnswer:\n```java\nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n```\n\nQuestion: How to read/write String from/to .txt?\nAnswer:\n```java\nPrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"output.txt\", \"UTF-8\");\ntry (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"input.txt\"))) {\n    String line;\n    while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n        // do something with line\n        writer.println(line);\n    }\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n} finally {\n    writer.close();\n}\n```\n\nQuestion: How to sort a list of objects in Java?\nAnswer:\n```java\nList<Person> persons = new ArrayList<>();\n// add persons to the list\nCollections.sort(persons, new Comparator<Person>() {\n    @Override\n    public int compare(Person p1, Person p2) {\n        return p1.getName().compareTo(p2.getName());\n   "}
