If there are no more elements in the iteration, it throws a NoSuchElementException. We can use a ternary operator to check if there is a next element before calling next(). If there is not, it returns null.\nQuestion: How can I convert a List to a Map using Java 8?\nPlease using this api: Collectors.toMap.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Collectors.toMap\n<<<code>>>: Map<String, String> map = list.stream().collect(Collectors.toMap(MyObject::getKey, MyObject::getValue));\n<<<explanation>>>: The toMap collector is a terminal operation that transforms a stream into a Map. The first two arguments are the key and value mapping functions. The third argument is an optional merge function that is used to resolve collisions between values associated with the same key.\nQuestion: How can I sort a list in Java 8?\nPlease using this api: Stream.sorted.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Stream.sorted\n<<<code>>>: List<String> sortedList = myList.stream().sorted().collect(Collectors.toList());\n<<<explanation>>>: The sorted() method of the Stream interface returns a stream consisting of the elements of this stream, sorted according to natural order. The sorted() method returns a sorted view of the stream. The sorted view is backed by the original stream, and actions performed on the sorted view do not affect the original stream.\nQuestion: How can I find the intersection of two lists in Java 8?\nPlease using this api: Stream.filter.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Stream.filter\n<<<code>>>: List<String> intersection = list1.stream().filter(list2::contains).collect(Collectors.toList());\n<<<explanation>>>: The filter() method of the Stream interface returns a stream consisting of the elements of this stream that match the given predicate. In this case, we are filtering list1 to only include elements that are also in list2.\nQuestion: How can I find the union of two lists in Java 8?\nPlease using this api: Stream.distinct.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Stream.distinct\n<<<code>>>: List<String> union = Stream.concat(list1.stream(), list2.stream()).distinct().collect(Collectors.toList());\n<<<explanation>>>: The distinct() method of the Stream interface returns a stream consisting of the distinct elements (according to Object.equals(Object)) of this stream. In this case, we are concatenating list1 and list2, and then filtering out duplicates.\nQuestion: How can I find the difference of two lists in Java 8?\nPlease using this api: Stream.filter.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Stream.filter\n<<<code>>>: List<String> difference = list1.stream().filter(element -> !list2.contains(element)).collect(Collectors.toList());\n<<<explanation>>>: The filter() method of the Stream interface returns a stream consisting of the elements of this stream that match the given predicate. In this case, we are filtering list1 to only include elements that are not in list2.\nQuestion: How can I find the maximum element in a list in Java 8?\nPlease using this api: Stream.max.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Stream.max\n<<<code>>>: Optional<Integer> max = myList.stream().max(Integer::compareTo);\n<<<explanation>>>: The max() method of the Stream interface returns an Optional describing the maximum element of this stream, or an empty Optional if the stream is empty. The comparator is used to compare the elements.\nQuestion: How can I find the minimum element in a list in Java 8?\nPlease using this api: Stream.min.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Stream.min\n<<<code>>>: Optional<Integer> min = myList.stream().min(Integer::compareTo);\n<<<explanation>>>: The min() method of the Stream interface returns an Optional describing the minimum element of this stream, or an empty Optional if the stream is empty. The comparator is used to compare"}
