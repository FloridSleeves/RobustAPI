The number of bytes read is returned as an integer. If there are no bytes to read, -1 is returned.\nQuestion: How can I read a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: FileInputStream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileInputStream\n<<<code>>>: FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(\"file.txt\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The FileInputStream class obtains input bytes from a file in a file system.

It makes the performance fast by buffering characters. The BufferedReader class in Java is used for buffering characters. It makes the performance fast by buffering characters.\nQuestion: How can I write to a file line by line in Java?\nPlease using this api: BufferedWriter.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedWriter\n<<<code>>>: BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(\"file.txt\"));\nbw.write(\"This is a line of text\");\nbw.newLine();\nbw.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The BufferedWriter class in Java is used for buffering characters.

The try block contains a set of statements where an exception can occur. The catch block is used to handle the exception. The finally block is used to execute important code such as closing the connection, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.\n\n\nA: The problem is likely due to the fact that you are writing the encrypted data to the file as a byte array, and then trying to read it back in as a byte array. When you read it back in, you are not getting the original text because the encrypted data is not in a format that can be easily read back into text.\nInstead, you should write the encrypted data to the file as a string, and then read it back in as a string. Here's how you can do that:\n\nIn your encryption code:\n\n```java\nbyte[] outputBytes = cipher.doFinal(msgStr.getBytes());\nFileOutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream(encryptedFile, true);\noutputStream.write(outputBytes);\noutputStream.close();\n```\n\nChange it to:\n\n```java\nbyte[] outputBytes = cipher.doFinal(msgStr.getBytes());\nString encryptedString = new String(outputBytes);\nFileOutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream(encryptedFile, true);\noutputStream.write(encryptedString.getBytes());\noutputStream.close();\n```\n\nAnd in your decryption code:\n\n```java\nbyte[] inputBytes = new byte[(int) inputFile.length()];\ninputStream.read(inputBytes"}
