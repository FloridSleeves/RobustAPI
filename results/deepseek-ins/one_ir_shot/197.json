Improve this question                    Does anyone have an example of an SSH library connection using Java.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: InputStream in = new SSHClient().exec(\"command\").getInputStream();\nint c;\nwhile ((c = in.read()) != -1) {\n    System.out.print((char) c);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The read() method of the InputStream class reads the next byte of data from the input stream. Returns the next byte of data, or -1 if the end of the stream is reached. This is a blocking operation.\nQuestion: How to get the current date and time in Java?\nPlease using this api: Instant.now.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Instant.now\n<<<code>>>: LocalDateTime now = Instant.now().atZone(ZoneId.systemDefault()).toLocalDateTime();\n<<<explanation>>>: The now() method of the Instant class returns the current time from the system clock in the default time-zone. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to convert a string to a date in Java?\nPlease using this api: SimpleDateFormat.parse.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: SimpleDateFormat.parse\n<<<code>>>: SimpleDateFormat formatter = new SimpleDateFormat(\"dd-MM-yyyy\");\nDate date = formatter.parse(\"25-12-2010\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The parse() method of the SimpleDateFormat class parses text from a string to produce a Date.\nQuestion: How to convert a date to a string in Java?\nPlease using this api: SimpleDateFormat.format.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: SimpleDateFormat.format\n<<<code>>>: SimpleDateFormat formatter = new SimpleDateFormat(\"dd-MM-yyyy\");\nString dateString = formatter.format(new Date());\n<<<explanation>>>: The format() method of the SimpleDateFormat class converts a Date to a String.\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.readAllLines.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.readAllLines\n<<<code>>>: List<String> lines = Files.readAllLines(Paths.get(\"file.txt\"), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);\n<<<explanation>>>: The readAllLines() method of the Files class reads all lines from a file into a List of Strings. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to write to a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.write\n<<<code>>>: Files.write(Paths.get(\"file.txt\"), \"Hello, World!\".getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));\n<<<explanation>>>: The write() method of the Files class writes bytes to a file. If the file does not exist, it is created. If it does exist, it is truncated to zero size. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to handle exceptions in Java?\nPlease using this api: try-catch-finally.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: try-catch-finally\n<<<code>>>: try {\n    // code that may throw an exception\n} catch (ExceptionType name) {\n    // code to handle the exception\n} finally {\n    // code to be executed regardless of whether an exception occurred\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The try-catch-finally block in Java is used to handle exceptions. The try block contains a set of statements where an exception can occur. The catch block is used to handle the exception. The finally block is used to execute important code such as closing a connection, regardless of whether an exception occurred.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
