This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I sort an ArrayList in Java?\nPlease using this api: Collections.sort.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Collections.sort\n<<<code>>>: Collections.sort(list);\n<<<explanation>>>: The sort() method of the Collections class sorts the specified list into ascending order. This is a stable, in-place sorting algorithm with a time complexity of O(n log(n)).\nQuestion: How can I find the maximum value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint max = Arrays.stream(array).max().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The max() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalInt that represents the maximum element of this stream. The getAsInt() method returns the value of this OptionalInt. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the minimum value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint min = Arrays.stream(array).min().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The min() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalInt that represents the minimum element of this stream. The getAsInt() method returns the value of this OptionalInt. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the average of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\ndouble average = Arrays.stream(array).average().getAsDouble();\n<<<explanation>>>: The average() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalDouble that represents the average of the elements of this stream. The getAsDouble() method returns the value of this OptionalDouble. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the count of elements in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nlong count = Arrays.stream(array).count();\n<<<explanation>>>: The count() method of the Stream interface returns the count of elements in this stream. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the sum of elements in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the maximum value in an ArrayList in Java?\nPlease using this api: Collections.max.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Collections.max\n<<<code>>>: int max = Collections.max(list);\n<<<explanation>>>: The max() method of the Collections class returns the maximum element in the specified collection. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the minimum value in an ArrayList in Java?\nPlease using this api: Collections.min.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Collections.min\n<<<code>>>: int min = Collections.min(list);\n<<<explanation>>>: The min() method of the Collections class returns the minimum element in the specified collection. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I sort an ArrayList in Java?\nPlease using this api: Collections."}
