In this case, we are writing a script that sets a variable in JavaScript to the value of the boardSize.\nQuestion: How to create a 2D array in JavaScript?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Array of Arrays\n<<<code>>>: var board = new Array(boardSize);\nfor (var i = 0; i < boardSize; i++) {\n    board[i] = new Array(boardSize);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: In JavaScript, a 2D array is an array of arrays. We create an array of arrays by first creating an array of the desired height (boardSize), then filling each sub-array with a new array of the desired width (boardSize).\nQuestion: How to create a 2D array in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: new int[rows][columns]\n<<<code>>>: int[][] board = new int[boardSize][boardSize];\n<<<explanation>>>: In Java, a 2D array is created by specifying the number of rows and columns. In this case, we create a 2D array of integers with the same number of rows and columns as the boardSize.\nQuestion: How to iterate over a 2D array in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: for-each loop\n<<<code>>>: for (int[] row : board) {\n    for (int cell : row) {\n        // do something with cell\n    }\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: In Java, you can iterate over a 2D array using a for-each loop. The outer loop iterates over the rows, and the inner loop iterates over the cells in each row.\nQuestion: How to iterate over a 2D array in JavaScript?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: for loop\n<<<code>>>: for (var i = 0; i < board.length; i++) {\n    for (var j = 0; j < board[i].length; j++) {\n        // do something with board[i][j]\n    }\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: In JavaScript, you can iterate over a 2D array using a for loop. The outer loop iterates over the rows, and the inner loop iterates over the cells in each row.\nQuestion: How to fill a 2D array in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: for-each loop\n<<<code>>>: for (int i = 0; i < board.length; i++) {\n    for (int j = 0; j < board[i].length; j++) {\n        board[i][j] = someValue;\n    }\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: In Java, you can fill a 2D array using a for-each loop. The outer loop iterates over the rows, and the inner loop iterates over the cells in each row. You can then assign a value to each cell.\nQuestion: How to fill a 2D array in JavaScript?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: for loop\n<<<code>>>: for (var i = 0; i < board.length; i++) {\n    for (var j = 0; j < board[i].length; j++) {\n        board[i][j] = someValue;\n    }\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: In JavaScript, you can fill a 2D array using a for loop. The outer loop iterates over the rows, and the inner loop iterates over the cells in each row. You can then assign a value to each cell.\n\n\nA: You can use the following code to calculate the sum of an array in Java using the Arrays.stream API:\n\n```java\nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n```\n\nIn this code, `Arrays.stream(array)` creates a stream of integers from the array. The `sum()` method then calculates the sum of these integers.\n\nTo pass the boardSize parameter from a servlet to a JavaScript file, you can use the PrintWriter.write"}
