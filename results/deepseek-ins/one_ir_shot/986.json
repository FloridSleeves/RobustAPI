The bytes are encoded in the platform's default charset.\nQuestion: How can I read a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: FileInputStream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileInputStream\n<<<code>>>: File file = new File(\"path/to/file.txt\");\nFileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(file);\n<<<explanation>>>: The FileInputStream class is used to read data from a file. It is part of the Java I/O package and is used for reading binary data from a file.\nQuestion: How can I write to a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: FileOutputStream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileOutputStream\n<<<code>>>: File file = new File(\"path/to/file.txt\");\nFileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(file);\n<<<explanation>>>: The FileOutputStream class is used to write data to a file. It is part of the Java I/O package and is used for writing binary data to a file.\nQuestion: How can I read a line from a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader\n<<<code>>>: File file = new File(\"path/to/file.txt\");\nFileReader fr = new FileReader(file);\nBufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);\nString line = br.readLine();\n<<<explanation>>>: The BufferedReader class is used to read text from a character-input stream. It buffers characters so as to provide for the efficient reading of characters, arrays, and lines. The readLine method reads a line of text. It returns null if the end of the stream has been reached.\nQuestion: How can I write to a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: BufferedWriter.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedWriter\n<<<code>>>: File file = new File(\"path/to/file.txt\");\nFileWriter fw = new FileWriter(file);\nBufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(fw);\nbw.write(\"Hello World\");\nbw.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The BufferedWriter class in Java is used to provide buffering for Writer instances. It makes the performance fast by buffering characters. The buffered characters are used as the basic unit of input and output.\nQuestion: How can I read a file line by line in Java?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader\n<<<code>>>: File file = new File(\"path/to/file.txt\");\nFileReader fr = new FileReader(file);\nBufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);\nString line;\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The BufferedReader class is used to read text from a character-input stream. It buffers characters so as to provide for the efficient reading of characters, arrays, and lines. The readLine method reads a line of text. It returns null if the end of the stream has been reached.\nQuestion: How can I write to a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: BufferedWriter.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedWriter\n<<<code>>>: File file = new File(\"path/to/file.txt\");\nFileWriter fw = new FileWriter(file);\nBufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(fw);\nbw.write(\"Hello World\");\nbw.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The BufferedWriter class in Java is used to provide buffering for Writer instances.
