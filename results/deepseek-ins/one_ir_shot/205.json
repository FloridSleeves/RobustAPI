Returns the next byte of data, or -1 if the end of the stream is reached. This is a blocking operation.\nQuestion: How can I convert a List of Objects to a JSON String in Java?\nPlease using this api: ObjectMapper.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: ObjectMapper\n<<<code>>>: ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();\nString jsonString = mapper.writeValueAsString(myObjectsList);\n<<<explanation>>>: The writeValueAsString() method of the ObjectMapper class converts the given object into a JSON string.\nQuestion: How can I sort a List in Java?\nPlease using this api: Collections.sort.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Collections.sort\n<<<code>>>: Collections.sort(myList);\n<<<explanation>>>: The sort() method of the Collections class sorts the specified list into ascending order.\nQuestion: How can I find the maximum value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint max = Arrays.stream(array).max().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The max() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalInt that represents the maximum element of this stream. The getAsInt() method returns the value of this OptionalInt.\nQuestion: How can I find the minimum value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint min = Arrays.stream(array).min().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The min() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalInt that represents the minimum element of this stream. The getAsInt() method returns the value of this OptionalInt.\nQuestion: How can I find the average of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\ndouble average = Arrays.stream(array).average().getAsDouble();\n<<<explanation>>>: The average() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalDouble that represents the average of the elements of this stream. The getAsDouble() method returns the value of this OptionalDouble.\nQuestion: How can I count the number of elements in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nlong count = Arrays.stream(array).count();\n<<<explanation>>>: The count() method of the Stream interface returns the count of elements in this stream.\nQuestion: How can I check if a string contains a substring in Java?\nPlease using this api: String.contains.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: String.contains\n<<<code>>>: boolean contains = myString.contains(substring);\n<<<explanation>>>: The contains() method of the String class returns true if and only if this string contains the specified sequence of char values.\nQuestion: How can I replace a substring in a string in Java?\nPlease using this api: String.replace.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: String.replace\n<<<code>>>: String replaced = myString.replace(oldSubstring, newSubstring);\n<<<explanation>>>: The replace() method of the String class returns a new string resulting from replacing all occurrences of oldChar in this string with newChar.\nQuestion: How can I split a string into an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: String.split.\n"}
