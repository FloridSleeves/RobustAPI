This is a terminal operation.\n\n\nA: The issue you're facing is due to the fact that the TCP protocol does not guarantee that the data you send will be received in one go. It is possible that the data you send is split into multiple packets and arrives in different parts. This is known as TCP fragmentation.\nTo handle this, you can use TCP's concept of \"streaming\". Instead of sending a single JSON string, you can send it in chunks. Each chunk should be a complete JSON object. You can use a delimiter to indicate the end of each chunk.\nHere's an example of how you can modify your server code:\n\n```java\npublic void sendResponse(String response) {\n    byte[] bytes = response.getBytes();\n    int length = bytes.length;\n    byte[] lengthBytes = ByteBuffer.allocate(4).putInt(length).array();\n\n    DataOutputStream out = new DataOutputStream(mClientSocket.getOutputStream());\n    out.write(lengthBytes); // send the length of the JSON string\n    out.write(bytes); // send the JSON string\n    out.flush();\n}\n```\n\nAnd here's how you can modify your client code:\n\n```java\nBufferedReader input = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(mSocket.getInputStream()));\nDataInputStream in = new DataInputStream(mSocket.getInputStream());\n\nbyte[] lengthBytes = new byte[4];\nin.readFully(lengthBytes);\nint length = ByteBuffer.wrap(lengthBytes).getInt();\n\nbyte[] bytes = new byte[length];\nin.readFully(bytes);\nString response = new String(bytes);\n\nData data = new Gson().fromJson(response, Data.class);\n```\n\nThis way, you're sending the length of the JSON string first, followed by the JSON string itself. On the client side, you're first reading the length of the JSON string, then reading the JSON string itself. This way, you can ensure that you're always receiving a complete JSON object.\n\nPlease note that this is a simple example and might not cover all edge cases. You might need to handle exceptions and edge cases according to your application's requirements.\n\nAlso, remember that TCP is a stream-based protocol, not a message-based protocol. It does not provide any mechanism for ensuring that the entire message is received. If you need to ensure that the entire message is received, you should use a different protocol that provides this functionality, such as HTTP/HTTPS or a custom protocol.\n\nLastly, remember to close your streams properly to free up resources.\n\nI hope this helps you solve your issue. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.\n\n\nA: You can use the DataOutputStream.writeUTF() method to send the JSON string. This method writes a string in modified UTF-8 format to the output stream. The length of the string is written as a two-byte value, followed by the string data. This format allows for the transmission of any string of characters.\n\nHere is how you can modify your server code:\n\n```java\npublic void sendResponse(String response) {\n    DataOutputStream out = new DataOutputStream(mClientSocket.getOutputStream());\n    try {\n        out.writeUTF(response);\n        out.flush();\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd here is how you can modify your client code:\n\n```java\nBufferedReader input = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(mSocket.getInputStream()));\nDataInputStream in = new DataInputStream(mSocket.getInputStream());\n"}
