The getAsInt() method returns the value of the OptionalInt. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the minimum value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint min = Arrays.stream(array).min().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The min() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalInt that represents the minimum element of this stream. The getAsInt() method returns the value of the OptionalInt. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the average of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\ndouble average = Arrays.stream(array).average().getAsDouble();\n<<<explanation>>>: The average() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalDouble that represents the average of the elements of this stream. The getAsDouble() method returns the value of the OptionalDouble. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I count the number of elements in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nlong count = Arrays.stream(array).count();\n<<<explanation>>>: The count() method of the Stream interface returns the count of elements in this stream. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I check if an array contains a specific value in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nboolean contains = Arrays.stream(array).anyMatch(x -> x == 3);\n<<<explanation>>>: The anyMatch() method of the IntStream class returns whether any elements of this stream match the provided predicate. This is a short-circuiting terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I sort an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {5, 2, 3, 1, 4};\nint[] sortedArray = Arrays.stream(array).sorted().toArray();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sorted() method of the IntStream class returns a new stream consisting of the elements of this stream, sorted according to natural order. This is a intermediate operation.\nQuestion: How can I reverse an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint[] reversedArray = IntStream.range(0, array.length).map(i -> array[array.length"}
