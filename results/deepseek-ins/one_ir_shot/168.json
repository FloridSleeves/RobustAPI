Returns the byte read, or -1 if the end of the stream is reached.\nQuestion: How can I sort a list in Java?\nPlease using this api: Collections.sort.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Collections.sort\n<<<code>>>: List<String> list = Arrays.asList(\"D\", \"C\", \"E\", \"B\", \"A\");\nCollections.sort(list);\n<<<explanation>>>: The sort() method of the Collections class sorts the specified list into ascending order. The sort is not stable, i.e., equal elements may not preserve their relative order. This is a stable sort.\nQuestion: How can I find the maximum value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint max = Arrays.stream(array).max().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The max() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalInt that represents the maximum element of this stream. If the stream is empty, the result is an empty Optional. This is a short-circuiting terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the minimum value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint min = Arrays.stream(array).min().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The min() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalInt that represents the minimum element of this stream. If the stream is empty, the result is an empty Optional. This is a short-circuiting terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the average of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\ndouble average = Arrays.stream(array).average().getAsDouble();\n<<<explanation>>>: The average() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalDouble that represents the average of the elements of this stream. If the stream is empty, the result is an empty Optional. This is a short-circuiting terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I count the number of elements in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nlong count = Arrays.stream(array).count();\n<<<explanation>>>: The count() method of the Stream interface returns the count of elements in this stream. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the sum of the squares of the elements in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sumOfSquares = Arrays.stream(array).map(n -> n * n).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The map() method of the Stream interface returns a stream consisting of the results of applying the given function to the elements of this stream. The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the product of the elements in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint product = Arrays.stream(array).reduce(1, (a, b) -> a * b"}
