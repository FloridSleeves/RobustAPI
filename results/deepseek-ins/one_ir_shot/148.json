Returns the next byte of data, or -1 if the end of the stream is reached.\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java?:\nPlease using this api: FileInputStream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileInputStream\n<<<code>>>: FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(\"test.txt\");\nint data = fis.read();\n<<<explanation>>>: The read() method of the FileInputStream class reads the next byte of data from the file. It returns an int value which is the byte read, or -1 if the end of the file is reached.\nQuestion: How to read a file line by line in Java?:\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"test.txt\"));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The readLine() method of the BufferedReader class reads a line of text. It returns a String containing the contents of the line, or null if the end of the stream has been reached.\nQuestion: How to write to a file in Java?:\nPlease using this api: FileOutputStream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileOutputStream\n<<<code>>>: FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(\"test.txt\");\nString data = \"Hello, World!\";\nbyte[] arr = data.getBytes();\nfos.write(arr);\n<<<explanation>>>: The write() method of the FileOutputStream class writes bytes to the file.\nQuestion: How to create a file in Java?:\nPlease using this api: File.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: File\n<<<code>>>: File file = new File(\"test.txt\");\nboolean created = file.createNewFile();\n<<<explanation>>>: The createNewFile() method of the File class creates a new, empty file in the file system represented by this abstract pathname if and only if a file with this name does not yet exist.\nQuestion: How to delete a file in Java?:\nPlease using this api: File.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: File\n<<<code>>>: File file = new File(\"test.txt\");\nboolean deleted = file.delete();\n<<<explanation>>>: The delete() method of the File class deletes the file or directory denoted by this abstract pathname.\nQuestion: How to list files in a directory in Java?:\nPlease using this api: File.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: File\n<<<code>>>: File folder = new File(\"path/to/folder\");\nString[] list = folder.list();\n<<<explanation>>>: The list() method of the File class returns an array of strings naming the files and directories in the directory denoted by this abstract pathname.\nQuestion: How to check if a file exists in Java?:\nPlease using this api: File.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: File\n<<<code>>>: File file = new File(\"test.txt\");\nboolean exists = file.exists();\n<<<explanation>>>: The exists() method of the File class tests whether the file or directory denoted by this abstract pathname exists.\nQuestion: How to get the size of a file in Java?:\nPlease using this api: File.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: File\n<<<code>>>: File file = new File(\"test.txt\");\nlong size = file.length();\n<<<explanation>>>: The length() method of the File class returns the length of the file in bytes.\nQuestion: How to create a directory in Java?:\nPlease using this api: File.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: File\n<<<code>>>: File dir = new File(\"path/to/directory\");\nboolean created = dir.mkdir();\n<<<explanation>>>: The mkdir() method of the File class creates a directory named by this abstract pathname.\nQuestion: How to delete a directory in Java?:\nPlease using this api: File.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: File\n<<<code>>>: File dir = new File(\"path"}
