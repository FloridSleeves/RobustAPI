Now I'm using the .split() function to try separate the tweets from one another but it would seem that \\r\\n09/19/14 isn't an appropriate split string? Here is the code:String[] value = line.split(\"\\r\\n09/19/14\");PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"hello.txt\", \"UTF-8\");writer.println(value[0]);writer.close();The text file 'hello', when I open it is just the following string again, \"TweetJSONObject\\r\\n09/19/14TweetJSONObject\".

The string is interpreted as a sequence of Unicode characters. The characters are written in exactly the same order.\nQuestion: How to get the current date and time in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: java.time.LocalDateTime.now()\n<<<code>>>: LocalDateTime now = LocalDateTime.now();\nSystem.out.println(now);\n<<<explanation>>>: The now() method of the LocalDateTime class returns the current date and time. The result is a LocalDateTime object.\nQuestion: How to convert a string to an integer in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Integer.parseInt()\n<<<code>>>: int i = Integer.parseInt(\"123\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The parseInt() method of the Integer class parses the string argument as a signed decimal integer. The characters in the string must all be decimal digits, except that the first character may be an ASCII minus sign '-' to indicate a negative value. The resulting integer value is returned.\nQuestion: How to convert a string to a float in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Float.parseFloat()\n<<<code>>>: float f = Float.parseFloat(\"123.45\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The parseFloat() method of the Float class parses the string argument as a floating-point number. The characters in the string must all be decimal digits, which are interpreted as the integer part of the number. The fractional part of the number is determined by the position of any decimal point in the string and the number of digits following it. The resulting float value is returned.\nQuestion: How to convert a string to a double in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Double.parseDouble()\n<<<code>>>: double d = Double.parseDouble(\"123.45\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The parseDouble() method of the Double class parses the string argument as a floating-point number. The characters in the string must all be decimal digits, which are interpreted as the integer part of the number. The fractional part of the number is determined by the position of any decimal point in the string and the number of digits following it. The resulting double value is returned.\nQuestion: How to convert an integer to a string in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Integer.toString()\n<<<code>>>: String s = Integer.toString(123);\n<<<explanation>>>: The toString() method of the Integer class returns a String object representing the specified integer.\nQuestion: How to convert a float to a string in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Float.toString()\n<<<code>>>: String s = Float.toString(123.45f);\n<<<explanation>>>: The toString() method of the Float class returns a String object representing the specified float.\nQuestion: How to convert a double to a string in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Double.toString()\n<<<code>>>: String s = Double.toString(123.45);\n<<<explanation>>>: The toString() method of the Double class returns a String object representing the specified double.\nQuestion: How to convert a string to a boolean in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Boolean.parseBoolean()\n<<<code>>>: boolean b = Boolean.parseBoolean(\"true\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The parseBoolean() method of the Boolean class parses the string argument as a boolean. The string is considered to be true if it is not null and is equal, ignoring case, to the string \"true\". The string is considered to be false if it is not null and is equal, ignoring case, to the string \"false\". The resulting boolean value is returned.\nQuestion: How to convert a boolean to a string in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Boolean.toString()\n<<<code>>>: String s = Boolean.toString(true);\n<<<explanation>>>: The toString() method of the Boolean class returns a String object representing the specified boolean. The string is \"true\" if the boolean is true; otherwise,"}
