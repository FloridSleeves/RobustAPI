The problem is that you are not closing the PrintWriter. Always remember to close your resources after you are done using them. Here is the corrected code:\npublic void hourlyOverall() throws FileNotFoundException{   \n    PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(\"wage info\");\n    hourlyOverall = tips / hours + hourlyWage;\n    out.println(hourlyOverall);\n    out.close(); // Always remember to close your resources\n}\n\nAlso, make sure that the file \"wage info\" is in the same directory as your Java program. If it is not, you will need to provide the full path to the file.\n\nA: You are creating a FileOutputStream but not using it. You should use PrintWriter to write to the file.\nHere is the corrected code:\npublic void hourlyOverall() throws FileNotFoundException{   \n    PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(\"wage info\");\n    hourlyOverall = tips / hours + hourlyWage;\n    out.println(hourlyOverall);\n    out.close();\n}\n\nThe FileOutputStream is used for writing raw bytes to a file, while PrintWriter is used for writing formatted representations of objects to a file.\nAlso, remember to close the PrintWriter after you are done with it. This is to ensure that all data is written to the file and that the file is properly closed.\n\nA: You are creating a FileOutputStream but not using it.
