The number of bytes read is returned as an integer. This method returns -1 if the end of the stream has been reached.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I read a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"file.txt\"));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The readLine() method of the BufferedReader class reads a line of text. A line is considered to be terminated by any one of a line feed ('\\n'), a carriage return ('\\r'), or a carriage return followed immediately by a linefeed.\nQuestion: How can I write to a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: BufferedWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(\"file.txt\"));\nbw.write(\"Hello, World!\");\nbw.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The write() method of the BufferedWriter class writes a string to the file. The string is translated into bytes according to the character encoding used by the file connection.\nQuestion: How can I read a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.readAllLines.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.readAllLines\n<<<code>>>: List<String> lines = Files.readAllLines(Paths.get(\"file.txt\"));\nlines.forEach(System.out::println);\n<<<explanation>>>: The readAllLines() method of the Files class returns a list containing all lines of the specified file. The lines are read from the file and returned as a List.\nQuestion: How can I write to a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.write\n<<<code>>>: Files.write(Paths.get(\"file.txt\"), \"Hello, World!\".getBytes());\n<<<explanation>>>: The write() method of the Files class writes bytes to the specified file. If the file does not exist, it is created. If the file exists, it is truncated to zero size.\nQuestion: How can I read a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: Scanner.nextLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Scanner.nextLine\n<<<code>>>: Scanner scanner = new Scanner(new File(\"file.txt\"));\nwhile (scanner.hasNextLine()) {\n    System.out.println(scanner.nextLine());\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The nextLine() method of the Scanner class is used to get the next line from the input. It returns the rest of the current line, excluding any line separator at the end. The position is set to the beginning of the next line.\nQuestion: How can I write to a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.println.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.println\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(\"file.txt\"));\npw.println(\"Hello, World!\");\npw.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The println() method of the PrintWriter class writes a line of text to the file. The line is"}
