In this case, we are splitting each line of the file into tokens based on spaces. The first token is the x value and the second token is the y value. We then convert these tokens to integers and use them to create a new Point object, which we add to our list of points.\nQuestion: How to create a custom exception in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: class MyException extends Exception\n<<<code>>>: \npublic class MyException extends Exception {\n    public MyException(String message) {\n        super(message);\n    }\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: To create a custom exception in Java, you simply create a new class that extends the Exception class. The constructor of your custom exception should call the constructor of the Exception class with the message you want to display.\nQuestion: How to handle exceptions in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: try, catch, finally\n<<<code>>>: \ntry {\n    // code that may throw an exception\n} catch (ExceptionType name) {\n    // code to handle the exception\n} finally {\n    // code to be executed regardless of whether an exception was thrown\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: In Java, you can handle exceptions using the try, catch, and finally blocks. The try block contains the code that may throw an exception. The catch block contains the code to handle the exception. The finally block contains the code to be executed regardless of whether an exception was thrown.\nQuestion: How to create a custom exception in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: class MyException extends Exception\n<<<code>>>: \npublic class MyException extends Exception {\n    public MyException(String message) {\n        super(message);\n    }\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: To create a custom exception in Java, you simply create a new class that extends the Exception class.
