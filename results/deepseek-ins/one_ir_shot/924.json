The bytes are encoded in the platform's default charset.

The write() method of the FileOutputStream class is a terminal operation.\n\n\nA: The code you provided is correct and should work as expected. It creates a new file, writes a string to it, and then closes the file.\n\n*\n\n*The FileNotFoundException is thrown when attempting to open a connection to a file that does not exist. In your case, it's thrown when you try to open a FileOutputStream with a non-existent file. You can solve this by creating the file before opening the FileOutputStream.\n\n*The IOException is thrown when an I/O operation is performed and an I/O error occurs. This can occur for a variety of reasons, such as running out of disk space, the file being locked by another process, etc. You can solve this by making sure that the file is properly closed after you're done with it.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\nFile file = new File(\"D:/projects/tFile.txt\");\ntry {\n    file.createNewFile();\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\ntry {\n    FileOutputStream fout = new FileOutputStream(file);\n    String s = \"Hello World\";\n    byte[] b = s.getBytes();\n    fout.write(b);\n    fout.close();\n} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n\nThis code will create a new file at the specified location if it doesn't already exist, write the string \"Hello World\" to the file, and then close the file. If an error occurs at any point, it will be caught and its stack trace will be printed to the console.\n\nA: The code you provided is correct and should work as expected.
