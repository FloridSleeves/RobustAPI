The regular expression \"(?i)<[^>]*Hello[^>]*>\" matches any string that starts with \"<\", followed by any characters that are not \">\", followed by \"Hello\", followed by any characters that are not \">\", and ends with \">\". The replacement string \"HI\" replaces the matched string. The \"(?i)\" in the regular expression makes the match case-insensitive.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\n\n\nA: Here is the solution using Java 8's Stream API:\n\n```java\nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n```\n\nThis code creates a stream of integers from the array, then uses the sum() method to calculate the sum of these integers.\n\nFor the second part of your question, you can use the replaceAll() method of the String class to replace the occurrences of the word \"Hello\" in your XML string. Here is an example:\n\n```java\nString xmlString = \"<some tag>    <some_nested_tag attr=\\\"Hello\\\"> Text </some_nested_tag>    Hello world Hello Programming</some tag>\";\nString replacedString = xmlString.replaceAll(\"(?i)<[^>]*Hello[^>]*>\", \"HI\");\n```\n\nThis code uses a regular expression to match the occurrences of the word \"Hello\" in the XML string. The (?i) at the start of the regular expression makes the match case-insensitive. The matched string is then replaced with the string \"HI\".\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the XML string is well-formed and that the word \"Hello\" is not part of the content of any XML tags. If the XML string is not well-formed or if the word \"Hello\" is part of the content of XML tags, you may need to use a more sophisticated XML parsing library to handle the XML string correctly.\n\nAlso, please note that the replaceAll() method in Java's String class uses regular expressions. If you're not familiar with regular expressions, you may need to learn more about them to use this method effectively.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n"}
