Please advise how can I perform this .\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: DataOutputStream.write\n<<<code>>>: dos.write(c);\n<<<explanation>>>: The write(int b) method of DataOutputStream class writes the specified byte to the output stream.\nQuestion: How to create a new file in java:\nPlease using this api: FileOutputStream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileOutputStream\n<<<code>>>: FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(\"newFile.txt\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The FileOutputStream class is a subclass of OutputStream and is used to write data to a file. The constructor of this class takes a single argument which is the name of the file. If the file does not exist, then a new file is created. If the file exists, then it is truncated to zero size.\nQuestion: How to read a file in java:\nPlease using this api: FileInputStream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileInputStream\n<<<code>>>: FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(\"file.txt\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The FileInputStream class is a subclass of InputStream and is used to read data from a file. The constructor of this class takes a single argument which is the name of the file.\nQuestion: How to write to a file in java:\nPlease using this api: FileOutputStream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileOutputStream\n<<<code>>>: FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(\"file.txt\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The FileOutputStream class is a subclass of OutputStream and is used to write data to a file. The constructor of this class takes a single argument which is the name of the file. If the file does not exist, then a new file is created. If the file exists, then it is truncated to zero size.\nQuestion: How to read a file line by line in java:\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"file.txt\"));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The BufferedReader class in Java is used to read the data from the character-input stream. It makes the performance fast by buffering characters. The readLine() method reads a line of text. It returns null if the end of the stream is reached.\nQuestion: How to write to a file line by line in java:\nPlease using this api: BufferedWriter.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedWriter\n<<<code>>>: BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(\"file.txt\"));\nbw.write(\"Hello, World!\");\nbw.newLine();\nbw.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The BufferedWriter class in Java is used to provide buffering for the characters written to the underlying output stream. It makes the performance fast by buffering characters. The write() method writes a string. The newLine() method writes the line separator. The close() method closes the stream.\nQuestion: How to convert a string to an integer in java:\nPlease using this api: Integer.parseInt.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Integer.parseInt\n<<<code>>>: int i = Integer.parseInt(\"123\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The parseInt() method of the Integer class converts the string argument into an integer. If the argument cannot be parsed into an integer, then it throws a NumberFormatException.\nQuestion: How to convert an integer to a string in java:\nPlease using this api: Integer.toString.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Integer.toString\n<<<code>>>: String s = Integer.toString(123);\n<<<explanation>>>: The toString() method of the Integer class returns a String object representing the specified integer.\nQuestion: How to sort an array in java:\nPlease using this api: Arrays.sort.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.sort\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {5, 2, 8, 3, 1};\nArrays.sort(array);\n<<<explanation>>>: The sort() method of the Arrays class sorts the specified array of objects into ascending numerical order.\nQuestion: How to find the maximum value in an array in java:\nPlease using this api: Arrays."}
