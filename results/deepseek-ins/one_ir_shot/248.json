This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to parse XOP/MTOM SOAP response using java?: :I just want to know, is there any simple way for parsing  MTOM/XOP SOAP response. The problem is that I use plain HTTP to send soap message and javax.xml for parsing response. But some services responds me with mulipart/related and it    requires much more complex logic to parse it (performance matters). So I wonder may I somehow take advantage of apache cxf, apache axiom or any other library for parsing MTOM/XOP SOAP response?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.

The @RequestMapping annotation is used to map a specific request path or pattern onto a specific handler method.\nQuestion: How to create a simple SOAP Web Service using Spring Boot and Spring-WS?\nPlease using this api: @Endpoint.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: @Endpoint\n<<<code>>>:\n@Endpoint\npublic class HelloEndpoint {\n\n    private static final String NAMESPACE_URI = \"http://spring.io/guides/gs-producing-web-service\";\n\n    @PayloadRoot(namespace = NAMESPACE_URI, localPart = \"getCountryRequest\")\n    @ResponsePayload\n    public GetCountryResponse getCountry(@RequestPayload GetCountryRequest request) {\n        GetCountryResponse response = new GetCountryResponse();\n        response.setCountry(request.getName());\n        return response;\n    }\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The @Endpoint annotation is used to define a SOAP endpoint. The @PayloadRoot annotation is used to map a specific request message onto a specific handler method. The @RequestPayload and @ResponsePayload annotations are used to bind the method parameter to the request message and the return value to the response message.\n\n\nA: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.
