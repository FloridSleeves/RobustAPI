I have the \"board\" stored as a 2 dimensional char array. I want to be able to send and receive this array through Sockets. I am currently using a InputStream and OutputStream to send single bytes. However, I don't think this will work for sending the array. Also, these streams only seem capable of sending int type data. Can someone please explain to me how too send 2 dimensional char arrays over sockets using I/O streams. Example code would be great! Thanks.

The value byte is returned as an int in the range 0 to 255. If no byte is available because the end of the stream has been reached, the value -1 is returned.\nQuestion: How to read/write a 2D char array through a Socket?\nPlease using this api: ObjectOutputStream.writeObject.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: ObjectOutputStream.writeObject\n<<<code>>>: \nObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(client.getOutputStream());\nchar[][] board = new char[3][3];\noos.writeObject(board);\n<<<explanation>>>: The writeObject() method of the ObjectOutputStream class writes an object to the output stream. The object is written in a way that can be read back in using an ObjectInputStream.\n```\n\nPlease note that the above code examples are for Java 8 and later. In Java 7, you would need to use a library like Google's Protocol Buffers or Apache Avro to serialize and deserialize your 2D char array.\n\nAlso, remember that you need to handle exceptions properly in your code. The above examples do not include exception handling for simplicity.\n\nLastly, the size of the 2D array should be known before sending it. If the size is not known beforehand, you would need to send some additional information (like the dimensions of the array) before sending the array itself.\n\nI hope this helps you with your question. Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\n```\n\nPlease answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.
