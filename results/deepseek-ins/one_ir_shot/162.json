Also is it better to just read up the input stream into an array or string and then create input streams for each use ?EDIT 2:Sorry to reopen the question, but the conditions are somewhat different when working inside desktop and web application. First of all, the InputStream i get from the org.apache.commons.fileupload.FileItem in my tomcat web app doesn't support markings thus cannot reset. Second, I'd like to be able to keep the file in memory for faster acces and less io problems when dealing with files.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.

The byte array contains the data to be read from the input stream.\nQuestion: How to use the cachedInputStream with POIFSFileSystem?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: POIFSFileSystem\n<<<code>>>: \nPOIFSFileSystem fileSystem = new POIFSFileSystem(cachedInputStream);\n<<<explanation>>>: The POIFSFileSystem class represents a file system in an Office document. It can be used to read and write Office documents in the Microsoft Office file format, such as Word and Excel.\n\n\nA: Question: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nAnswer:\n<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: \nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.

Returns the byte read, or -1 if the end of the stream is reached. The ByteArrayOutputStream.toByteArray() method returns a newly allocated byte array containing the data from this output stream. The ByteArrayInputStream class is a InputStream that reads from a byte array. The byte array contains the data to be read from the input stream.\n\nQuestion: How to use the cachedInputStream with POIFSFileSystem?\nAnswer:\n<<<api>>>: POIFSFileSystem\n<<<code>>>: \nPOIFSFileSystem fileSystem = new POIFSFileSystem(cachedInputStream);\n<<<explanation>>>: The POIFSFileSystem class represents a file system in an Office document. It can be used to read and write Office documents in the Microsoft Office file format, such as Word and Excel.\n\nPlease note that the InputStream.read method is not suitable for caching because it cannot be reset. If you need to reset the stream, you should consider using a BufferedInputStream which wraps an existing InputStream and buffers some data.\n\nA: Question: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nAnswer:\n<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: \nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.
