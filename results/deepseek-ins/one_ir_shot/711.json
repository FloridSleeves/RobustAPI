I have flat file with 10 columns and a total of, lets say, 9750 rows.  All the rows are pipe delimited.  I need to split the file into 2000 rows each (5 files).

How do I do this in Java?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: \nBufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"input.txt\"));\nString line;\nint count = 0;\nint fileCount = 1;\nPrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(\"output\" + fileCount + \".txt\");\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    pw.println(line);\n    count++;\n    if (count == 2000) {\n        pw.close();\n        fileCount++;\n        pw = new PrintWriter(\"output\" + fileCount + \".txt\");\n        count = 0;\n    }\n}\nbr.close();\npw.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: This code reads the input file line by line, writing each line to the current output file. When the count reaches 2000, it closes the current output file and starts writing to a new one. The new file is named \"output\" followed by the current fileCount.\nQuestion: How can I read a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: \nBufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"file.txt\"));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\nbr.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: This code reads the file line by line and prints each line to the console. The BufferedReader.readLine method returns null when there are no more lines to read.\nQuestion: How can I write to a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.println.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.println\n<<<code>>>: \nPrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(\"file.txt\");\npw.println(\"Hello, World!\");\npw.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: This code writes the string \"Hello, World!\" to the file \"file.txt\". The PrintWriter.println method writes a line to the file followed by a newline character. After writing, it is important to close the PrintWriter to free up system resources.\nQuestion: How can I read a CSV file in Java?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: \nBufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"file.csv\"));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    String[] values = line.split(\",\"); // split the line by comma\n    // do something with the values\n}\nbr.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: This code reads the CSV file line by line, splitting each line into an array of values using the comma as the delimiter. The BufferedReader.readLine method returns null when there are no more lines to read.\nQuestion: How can I write to a CSV file in Java?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.println.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.println\n<<<code>>>: \nPrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(\"file.csv\");\npw.println(\"value1,value2,value3\"); // write a line to the CSV file\npw.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: This code writes a line to the CSV file. The PrintWriter.println method writes a line to the file followed by a newline character. The values are separated by commas. After writing, it is important to close the PrintWriter to free up system resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
