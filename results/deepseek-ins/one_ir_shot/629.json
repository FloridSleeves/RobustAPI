For this program, I need to define several (in fact too many ~ 200) sets. I have researched and found that I could use ArrayLists in order to store integers.In the problem I am trying to solve, there are T (T being any integer) many different ArrayLists I need to create. I need to define a unique ArrayList for every value of T. For instance, for T=3 I will need to define three different ArrayLists where I will be able to store integers for every different index:ArrayList T1 = new ArrayList();ArrayList T2 = new ArrayList();ArrayList T3 = new ArrayList();The problem here is that I am clueless on how I may define as many ArrayLists as  T. I have tried to create a \"for loop\" in order to initialize these variables but as I expected it didn't turn out well (simply because I need different names for each ArrayList and I could not vary the name of every ArrayList) I was sure it wouldn't work (or at least I was sure that I was doing it wrong even if there is a way to do it - which I could not find by searching on the internet) but just to give an idea of what I was trying to do, the code looked like this:for (int i=1; i<T; i++) {    ArrayList T+i = new ArrayList(); //I tried to vary the name of the arraylist by adding the variable \"i\" next to T.}In the code above, I could not achieve to define indexes for the ArrayLists but please note that it would be extremely convenient if we can do this by adding indexes to ArrayLists.As this is my very first attempt on Dynamic Programming I am a little lost and I appreciate all of your help!

Thanks in advance.\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Map.get\n<<<code>>>: Map<String, ArrayList<Integer>> map = new HashMap<>();\nArrayList<Integer> T1 = map.get(\"T1\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The get() method of the Map interface returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or null if this map contains no mapping for the key.\nQuestion: How can I add elements to a specific index in an ArrayList in Java?\nPlease using this api: ArrayList.add.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: ArrayList.add\n<<<code>>>: ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();\nlist.add(0, 10); // Adds 10 at index 0\n<<<explanation>>>: The add() method of the ArrayList class adds the specified element at the specified position in this list. If the position is greater than the current size of the list, the element is added to the end of the list.\nQuestion: How can I remove elements from an ArrayList in Java?\nPlease using this api: ArrayList.remove.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: ArrayList.remove\n<<<code>>>: ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();\nlist.remove(0); // Removes the element at index 0\n<<<explanation>>>: The remove() method of the ArrayList class removes the element at the specified position in this list. If the position is greater than the current size of the list, it throws an IndexOutOfBoundsException.\nQuestion: How can I check if an ArrayList contains a specific element in Java?\nPlease using this api: ArrayList.contains.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: ArrayList.contains\n<<<code>>>: ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();\nboolean contains = list.contains(10); // Returns true if the list contains 10, false otherwise\n<<<explanation>>>: The contains() method of the ArrayList class returns true if this list contains the specified element.\nQuestion: How can I get the size of an ArrayList in Java?\nPlease using this api: ArrayList.size.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: ArrayList.size\n<<<code>>>: ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();\nint size = list.size(); // Returns the size of the list\n<<<explanation>>>: The size() method of the ArrayList class returns the number of elements in this list.\nQuestion: How can I iterate over an ArrayList in Java?\nPlease using this api: for-each loop.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: for-each loop\n<<<code>>>: ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();\nfor (int num : list) {\n    System.out.println(num);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The for-each loop is used to iterate over the elements of an array or an ArrayList. It does not provide access to the index of the current element, but it provides access to the value of the current element.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
