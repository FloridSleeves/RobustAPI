The tokens are usually separated by spaces. In this case, we are using it to break the string at the \"-\" and \"()\" characters. The result is that we get three parts of the string: part1 is the phone number, part2 is the fax number, and part3 is empty because there are no more tokens.\nQuestion: How to get the current date and time in Java?\nPlease using this api: java.time.LocalDateTime.now.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: java.time.LocalDateTime\n<<<code>>>: LocalDateTime now = LocalDateTime.now();\n<<<explanation>>>: The now() method of the LocalDateTime class returns the current date and time. This is a static factory method that returns an instance of LocalDateTime representing the current instant.\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: java.nio.file.Files.readAllLines.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: java.nio.file.Files\n<<<code>>>: List<String> lines = Files.readAllLines(Paths.get(\"file.txt\"));\n<<<explanation>>>: The readAllLines() method of the Files class reads all lines from a file into a list of strings. The file is specified by its path. The path is an instance of the Path class. The Paths.get() method is used to obtain a Path instance.\nQuestion: How to write to a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: java.nio.file.Files.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: java.nio.file.Files\n<<<code>>>: Files.write(Paths.get(\"file.txt\"), \"Hello, World!\".getBytes());\n<<<explanation>>>: The write() method of the Files class writes bytes to a file. The file is specified by its path. The path is an instance of the Path class. The Paths.get() method is used to obtain a Path instance. The \"Hello, World!\" string is converted to bytes before writing to the file.\nQuestion: How to sort a list in Java?\nPlease using this api: java.util.Collections.sort.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: java.util.Collections\n<<<code>>>: Collections.sort(list);\n<<<explanation>>>: The sort() method of the Collections class sorts the elements of a list in a specific order. The order is determined by the elements' natural ordering, which is defined by the compareTo() method of the elements' classes.\nQuestion: How to reverse a list in Java?\nPlease using this api: java.util.Collections.reverse.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: java.util.Collections\n<<<code>>>: Collections.reverse(list);\n<<<explanation>>>: The reverse() method of the Collections class reverses the order of the elements in a list. The first element becomes the last element, the second element becomes the second to last element, and so on.\nQuestion: How to find the maximum element in a list in Java?\nPlease using this api: java.util.Collections.max.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: java.util.Collections\n<<<code>>>: int max = Collections.max(list);\n<<<explanation>>>: The max() method of the Collections class returns the maximum element in a list. The maximum element is determined by the elements' natural ordering, which is defined by the compareTo() method of the elements' classes.\nQuestion: How to find the minimum element in a list in Java?\nPlease using this api: java.util.Collections.min.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: java.util.Collections\n<<<code>>>: int min = Collections.min(list);\n<<<explanation>>>: The min() method of the Collections class returns the minimum element in a list. The minimum element is determined by the elements' natural ordering, which is defined by the compareTo() method of the elements' classes.\nQuestion: How to create a new list from a sublist of another list in Java?\nPlease using this api: java.util.Collections."}
