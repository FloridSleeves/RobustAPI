The Bitmap.compress() method is used to compress the bitmap into a specific format. The File.mkdirs() method is used to create a directory and its parent directories if they do not exist.\n\nA: The code you provided seems to be correct. It creates a directory \"AVP_saved\" in the external storage directory if it doesn't exist, and then saves the image from the ImageView to this directory.\n\nIf the image is not saved, there could be a few reasons:\n\n1. Permissions: Make sure you have the necessary permissions in your AndroidManifest.xml file to write to external storage.\n\n2. Storage space: Check if there is enough space in your external storage to save the image.\n\n3. File path: The path you are using might not exist or it might not be accessible. You can print the value of `root` and `myDir` to verify if the directory is created and accessible.\n\n4. ImageView content: Make sure the ImageView has a valid image to save.\n\n5. Error in the code: There might be an error in the code that is not visible in the provided code snippet.\n\nIf you are still having issues, please provide more details about the error message or the behavior you are observing.\n\nAlso, consider using the `try-with-resources` statement to automatically close the `FileOutputStream`. This can help prevent potential resource leaks. Here is how you can modify your code:\n\n```java\ntry (FileOutputStream fOut = new FileOutputStream(file)) {\n    bitmap.compress(Bitmap.CompressFormat.PNG, 100, fOut);\n    fOut.flush();\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n```\n\nThis code will automatically close `fOut` when it is no longer needed, even if an exception is thrown.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>"}
