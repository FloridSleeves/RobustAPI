This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\n\n\nA: Here is how you can read from a file without using Scanner:\n\n```java\nprivate TreeMap<String, Double> prices = new TreeMap<String, Double>();\n\npublic void readFromFile(String fileName){\n    File file = new File(fileName);\n    BufferedReader br = null;\n    try {\n        br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file));\n        String line;\n        while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n            StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(line, \" \");\n            String item = st.nextToken(); //Gets the item name\n            double price = Double.parseDouble(st.nextToken()); //The next word is the price\n            prices.put(item, price);\n        }\n    } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    } finally {\n        try {\n            if (br != null) br.close();\n        } catch (IOException ex) {\n            ex.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, we use BufferedReader to read the file line by line. For each line, we use StringTokenizer to split the line into two parts: the item name and the price. We then put the item and price into the prices TreeMap.\n\nFor calculating the sum of an array in Java, you can use Arrays.stream as you mentioned:\n\n```java\nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n```\n\nIn this code, we create a stream from the array, and then call the sum() method on the stream to get the sum of the elements in the array.\n\nI hope this helps you understand how to read from a file and calculate the sum of an array in Java without using the Scanner class.\n\n\nA: Here is how you can read from a file without using Scanner:\n\n```java\nprivate TreeMap<String, Double> prices = new TreeMap<String, Double>();\n\npublic void readFromFile(String fileName){\n    File file = new File(fileName);\n    BufferedReader br = null;\n    try {\n        br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file));\n        String line;\n        while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n            StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(line, \" \");\n            String item = st.nextToken(); //Gets the item name\n            double price = Double.parseDouble(st.nextToken()); //The next word is the price\n            prices.put(item, price);\n        }\n    } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    } finally {\n        try {\n            if (br != null) br.close();\n        } catch (IOException ex) {\n            ex.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, we use BufferedReader to read the file line by line.
