This is a void method.\nQuestion: How can I find the maximum value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint max = Arrays.stream(array).max().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The max() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalInt that represents the maximum element of this stream. The getAsInt() method returns the value represented by this OptionalInt. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the minimum value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint min = Arrays.stream(array).min().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The min() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalInt that represents the minimum element of this stream. The getAsInt() method returns the value represented by this OptionalInt. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the average of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\ndouble average = Arrays.stream(array).average().getAsDouble();\n<<<explanation>>>: The average() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalDouble that represents the average of the elements of this stream. The getAsDouble() method returns the value represented by this OptionalDouble. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the sum of the squares of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sumOfSquares = Arrays.stream(array).map(x -> x * x).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The map() method of the IntStream class returns a stream consisting of the results of applying the given function to the elements of this stream. The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the product of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint product = Arrays.stream(array).reduce(1, (a, b) -> a * b);\n<<<explanation>>>: The reduce() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalInt that represents the reduction of the elements of this stream according to the provided binary operator. The getAsInt() method returns the value represented by this OptionalInt. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the sum of the cubes of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\n"}
