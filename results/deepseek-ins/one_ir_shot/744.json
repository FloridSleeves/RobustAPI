If the character is a newline, then the line is ended and the underlying output stream is flushed.\nQuestion: How can I sort a list of objects by a specific attribute in Java?\nPlease using this api: Streams.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Streams\n<<<code>>>: List<Object> sortedList = objects.stream().sorted(Comparator.comparing(Object::getAttribute)).collect(Collectors.toList());\n<<<explanation>>>: The sorted() method of the Stream class returns a stream consisting of the elements of this stream, sorted according to the provided Comparator. The collect() method then collects the sorted elements into a new List.\nQuestion: How can I find the maximum value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint max = Arrays.stream(array).max().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The max() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalInt that represents the maximum element of this stream. The getAsInt() method then returns the value of the OptionalInt.\nQuestion: How can I find the minimum value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint min = Arrays.stream(array).min().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The min() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalInt that represents the minimum element of this stream. The getAsInt() method then returns the value of the OptionalInt.\nQuestion: How can I find the average of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\ndouble average = Arrays.stream(array).average().getAsDouble();\n<<<explanation>>>: The average() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalDouble that represents the average of the elements of this stream. The getAsDouble() method then returns the value of the OptionalDouble.\nQuestion: How can I count the number of elements in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nlong count = Arrays.stream(array).count();\n<<<explanation>>>: The count() method of the Stream interface returns the count of elements in this stream.\n\n\nA: The issue you're experiencing is due to the fact that you're not flushing the PrintWriter after writing to it. The PrintWriter buffers the output and only writes it to the underlying output stream when it's full or when you call the flush() method.\nIn your case, you're not calling the flush() method after writing to the PrintWriter, so the output isn't being written to the file immediately.\nTo fix this, you should call the flush() method after you're done writing to the PrintWriter. Here's how you can do it:\nwrite.flush();\n\nThis will ensure that all the output is written to the file immediately.\nAlso, you should close the PrintWriter after you're done writing to it. You can do this by calling the close() method on the PrintWriter. Here's how you can do it:\nwrite.close();\n\nThis will ensure that the PrintWriter is properly closed and that all resources are released.\nBy calling flush() and close() after you're done writing to the PrintWriter, you should be able to get the output you expect in the file.\n\nA: The issue is not with the order of the appending, but with the fact that you are not flushing the PrintWriter after writing to it.\nThe PrintWriter buffers the output and only writes it to the underlying output stream"}
