This method can only be called once per call to next(). If the underlying collection is modified while the iteration is in progress in any way other than by calling this method, the results of the iteration are undefined.\nQuestion: How can I sort a list of objects in Java?\nPlease using this api: Collections.sort.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Collections.sort\n<<<code>>>: List<Object> list = new ArrayList<>();\nCollections.sort(list);\n<<<explanation>>>: The sort() method of the Collections class sorts the specified list into ascending order. The sort is not stable, i.e., equal elements may not preserve their relative order. The specified list is sorted into ascending order according to the natural ordering of its elements, or by a Comparator provided to a method.\nQuestion: How can I find the maximum value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint max = Arrays.stream(array).max().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The max() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalInt that represents the maximum element of this stream. If the stream is empty, the result is an empty Optional. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation. The getAsInt() method returns the value of this OptionalInt, blocking if necessary until it is available.\nQuestion: How can I find the minimum value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint min = Arrays.stream(array).min().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The min() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalInt that represents the minimum element of this stream. If the stream is empty, the result is an empty Optional. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation. The getAsInt() method returns the value of this OptionalInt, blocking if necessary until it is available.\n\n```\n\n## \ud83d\udca1 Solution:\n\n```python\ndef answer_questions(questions):\n    answers = []\n    for question in questions:\n        if \"How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\" in question:\n            answers.append(\"<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.
