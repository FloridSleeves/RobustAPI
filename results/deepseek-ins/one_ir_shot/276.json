My professor send us a JUnit test so we can know if our code is working correctly. Now every method has passed the test except the iterator test which fails the test. It appears to be a java.lang.AssertionError and I cant seem to figure out a way of fixing it.\n\nThe AssertionError is a subclass of the RuntimeException class and is thrown when a method being tested asserts that something is true. In other words, it's a way of telling you that your test is failing.\n\nIf you could see the error and point it out to me would be awesome. Thanks in advance\n\nThe error message you're seeing is usually followed by a stack trace, which will give you a clear indication of what's going wrong. This will usually point you to the line of code where the error is occurring.\n\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\n\nYou're correct, the Iterator.next method is used to get the next element from an Iterator. Here's an example of how you might use it:\n\n```java\nIterator<Contact> iterator = contacts.iterator();\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\n    Contact contact = iterator.next();\n    // Do something with contact\n}\n```\n\nThis code will iterate over each element in the `contacts` list, and do something with each one. The `hasNext()` method is used to check if there's another element in the list, and the `next()` method is used to get the next element.\n\nPlease using this api: Collections.sort.\n\nYou're also correct, Collections.sort is used to sort a list of objects. Here's an example of how you might use it:\n\n```java\nList<Contact> contacts = new ArrayList<>();\n// Add some contacts to the list\nCollections.sort(contacts, new Comparator<Contact>() {\n    @Override\n    public int compare(Contact c1, Contact c2) {\n        return c1"}
