Returns the next byte of data, or -1 if the end of the stream is reached.\nQuestion: How can I read a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"file.txt\"));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The readLine() method of the BufferedReader class reads a line of text. It returns null if the end of the stream has been reached.\nQuestion: How can I write to a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: BufferedWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(\"file.txt\"));\nbw.write(\"Hello, World!\");\nbw.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The write() method of the BufferedWriter class writes text to the file. The text is not written until the buffer is full.\nQuestion: How can I handle exceptions in Java?\nPlease using this api: try-catch-finally.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: try-catch-finally\n<<<code>>>: try {\n    FileReader fr = new FileReader(\"file.txt\");\n} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {\n    System.out.println(\"File not found: \" + e.getMessage());\n} finally {\n    System.out.println(\"End of program.\");\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The try-catch-finally block is used to handle exceptions in Java. The try block contains a set of statements where an exception can occur. The catch block contains a set of statements that handle the exception. The finally block contains a set of statements that are always executed, regardless of whether an exception occurs.\n\n\nA: Here is the answer to your questions:\n\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nAnswer:\n<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.
