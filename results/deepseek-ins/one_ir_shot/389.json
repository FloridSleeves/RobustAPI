This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Reheapify java.util.PriorityQueue after updating elements: :I have a PriorityQueue containing references to some objects. When I initially insert the elements into the priority queue the ordering is maintained by the data structure. Now after a remove operation I update some of the references which are being held by the priority queue. Ideally this requires a reheapify operation on the priority queue but as is obvious since I am modifying selected references externally a reheapify cannot be triggered. So what is the best way to ensure that I am able to get the advantage of a heap like fast extract max in the presence of modifications to arbitrary elements inside the queue? I see I need a better data structure?To be more specific I need an implementation of something like a Fibonacci heap in Java.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithmIs that available?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.

This method may be called repeatedly to get the next element in the iteration.\nQuestion: How can I sort a list of objects in Java?\nPlease using this api: Collections.sort.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Collections.sort\n<<<code>>>: List<MyObject> list = new ArrayList<>();\n// add elements to list\nCollections.sort(list);\n<<<explanation>>>: The sort() method of the Collections class sorts the specified list into ascending order. The sort is not stable, i.e., equal elements may not preserve their original order.\nQuestion: How can I find the maximum element in a list in Java?\nPlease using this api: Collections.max.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Collections.max\n<<<code>>>: List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);\nint max = Collections.max(list);\n<<<explanation>>>: The max() method of the Collections class returns the maximum element in the specified collection.\nQuestion: How can I find the minimum element in a list in Java?\nPlease using this api: Collections.min.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Collections.min\n<<<code>>>: List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);\nint min = Collections.min(list);\n<<<explanation>>>: The min() method of the Collections class returns the minimum element in the specified collection.\nQuestion: How can I reverse a list in Java?\nPlease using this api: Collections.reverse.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Collections.reverse\n<<<code>>>: List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);\nCollections.reverse(list);\n<<<explanation>>>: The reverse() method of the Collections class reverses the order of the elements in the specified list.\nQuestion: How can I shuffle a list in Java?\nPlease using this api: Collections.shuffle.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Collections.shuffle\n<<<code>>>: List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);\nCollections.shuffle(list);\n<<<explanation>>>: The shuffle() method of the Collections class shuffles the elements in the specified list using the default source of randomness.\nQuestion: How can I remove duplicates from a list in Java?\nPlease using this api: new HashSet.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: new HashSet\n<<<code>>>: List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5);\nList<Integer> listWithoutDuplicates = new ArrayList<>(new HashSet<>(list));\n<<<explanation>>>: A HashSet does not allow duplicate elements. By creating a new HashSet from the list, we automatically remove any duplicates. Then we create a new ArrayList from the HashSet.\nQuestion: How can I find the intersection of two lists in Java?\nPlease using this api: new HashSet.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: new HashSet\n<<<code>>>: List<Integer> list1 = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);\nList<Integer> list2 = Arrays.asList(4, 5, 6, 7, 8);\nlist1.retainAll(list2);\n<<<explanation>>>: The retainAll() method of the List interface removes from this list all of its elements that are not contained in the specified collection. In this case, it removes all elements from list1 that are not in list2.\nQuestion: How can I find the union of two lists in Java?\nPlease using this api: new HashSet.\nAnswer"}
