This method behaves as though invoking print(String.valueOf(x)) and then println(). This is a convenience method that behaves as though it were written: print(x); println();\nQuestion: How can I read a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: FileInputStream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileInputStream\n<<<code>>>: FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(\"file.txt\");\nbyte[] data = new byte[fis.available()];\nfis.read(data);\nString text = new String(data);\n<<<explanation>>>: The read() method of the FileInputStream class reads some number of bytes from the file into an array of bytes. The number of bytes actually read is returned as an integer. This method blocks until some input is available.\nQuestion: How can I write to a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: FileOutputStream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileOutputStream\n<<<code>>>: FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(\"file.txt\");\nString text = \"Hello, World!\";\nbyte[] data = text.getBytes();\nfos.write(data);\nfos.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The write() method of the FileOutputStream class writes b.length bytes from the specified byte array to this file output stream. The write(int b) method of the OutputStream class writes the specified byte to this file output stream.\nQuestion: How can I read a file line by line in Java?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"file.txt\"));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\nbr.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The readLine() method of the BufferedReader class reads a line of text. A line is considered to be terminated by any one of a line feed ('\\n'), a carriage return ('\\r'), or a carriage return followed immediately by a line feed.\nQuestion: How can I sort an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.sort.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.sort\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {5, 2, 8, 6, 1};\nArrays.sort(array);\n<<<explanation>>>: The sort() method of the Arrays class sorts the specified array of objects into ascending numerical order. The sorting algorithm is a variation of the QuickSort algorithm.\nQuestion: How can I find the maximum and minimum value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {5, 2, 8, 6, 1};\nint max = Arrays.stream(array).max().getAsInt();\nint min = Arrays.stream(array).min().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The max() method of the IntStream class returns the maximum element in this stream. The min() method of the IntStream class returns the minimum element in this stream.\nQuestion: How can I find the average of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {5, 2, 8, 6, 1};\ndouble average = Arrays.stream(array).average().getAsDouble();\n<<<explanation>>>: The average() method of the IntStream class returns the average of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the number of elements in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<"}
