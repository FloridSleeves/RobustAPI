Although the API's have the methods that return synchronised versions of common collections, there seems to be no way to programmatically release the lock by calling a finished method; AFAICT the lock appears to be released when the wrapper is garbage collected.Is there anything that does this in the Java SE API, or is it considered easy enough just to roll something myself?

Thanks for your constructive input.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: synchronized(collection) { Iterator<T> iterator = collection.iterator(); while (iterator.hasNext()) { T element = iterator.next(); // do something with element } }\n<<<explanation>>>: The synchronized keyword ensures that only one thread can access the code inside the block at a time. This is useful when you want to prevent simultaneous access to a shared resource. However, it does not provide a way to release the lock after you're done with the collection. If you need to do that, you would need to implement your own synchronization mechanism.\nQuestion: How to create a new thread in Java?\nPlease using this api: Thread.start.\n<<<api>>>: Thread.start\n<<<code>>>: new Thread(new Runnable() { public void run() { // your code here } }).start();\n<<<explanation>>>: The start() method of the Thread class starts a new thread of execution. The new thread begins execution of the run method of this Thread class. The start method is called on a thread object to start its execution.\nQuestion: How to create a new thread in Java?\nPlease using this api: Thread.run.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Thread.run\n<<<code>>>: new Thread(new Runnable() { public void run() { // your code here } }).run();\n<<<explanation>>>: The run() method of the Thread class is the entry point for any thread in Java. When a new thread is created, the run() method is invoked automatically. However, calling run() directly does not start a new thread. It just executes the code in the run() method in the current thread.\nQuestion: How to create a new thread in Java?\nPlease using this api: Thread.currentThread.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Thread.currentThread\n<<<code>>>: Thread currentThread = Thread.currentThread();\n<<<explanation>>>: The currentThread() method of the Thread class returns a reference to the currently executing thread object. This method is often used to get a reference to the current thread object in a static context.\nQuestion: How to create a new thread in Java?\nPlease using this api: Thread.sleep.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Thread.sleep\n<<<code>>>: Thread.sleep(1000);\n<<<explanation>>>: The sleep() method of the Thread class causes the current thread to temporarily pause and let other threads run. The thread is awakened when general processing time for all threads is zero. The argument is interpreted as milliseconds.\nQuestion: How to create a new thread in Java?\nPlease using this api: Thread.yield.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Thread.yield\n<<<code>>>: Thread.yield();\n<<<explanation>>>: The yield() method of the Thread class causes the currently executing thread object to temporarily pause and allow other threads to execute. The thread returns to the runnable state.\nQuestion: How to create a new thread in Java?\nPlease using this api: Thread.interrupt.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Thread.interrupt\n<<<code>>>: Thread thread = new Thread();\nthread.interrupt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The interrupt() method of the Thread class causes the thread to stop what it is doing and do something else. It is generally used to signal that the thread should stop what it is doing and do something else. The thread will continue to run until it is stopped or until it is notified by a method.\nQuestion: How to create a new thread in Java?\nPlease using this api: Thread.stop.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Thread.stop\n<<<code>>>: Thread thread = new Thread();\nthread.stop();\n<<<explanation>>>: The stop() method of the Thread class causes the thread to be stopped. This method can be called on a thread only if the thread is either a daemon thread or the current thread. The thread's stop() method can be called only once; subsequent calls will throw IllegalThreadStateException.\nQuestion: How to create a new thread in Java?\nPlease using this api: Thread.join.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Thread.join\n<<<code>>>: Thread thread = new Thread();\nthread.join();\n<<<explanation>>>: The join() method of the Thread class waits for this thread to die. It makes the current thread wait until this thread completes"}
