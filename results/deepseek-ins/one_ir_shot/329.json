Improve this question                    From our application we fetch images (jpeg/png) from a third party service, after download we want to save these images as compressed.Can any one please guide how to compress images in Java ?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: Iterator<BufferedImage> iterator = ImageIO.read(new File(\"image.jpg\")).iterator();\nBufferedImage image = iterator.next();\n<<<explanation>>>: The next() method of the Iterator interface returns the next element in the iteration. In this case, it returns the next BufferedImage from the iterator.\nQuestion: How to get the current date and time in Java?\nPlease using this api: LocalDateTime.now.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: LocalDateTime.now\n<<<code>>>: LocalDateTime now = LocalDateTime.now();\n<<<explanation>>>: The now() method of the LocalDateTime class returns the current date and time.\nQuestion: How to create a new thread in Java?\nPlease using this api: Thread.start.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Thread.start\n<<<code>>>: new Thread(() -> System.out.println(\"New thread\")).start();\n<<<explanation>>>: The start() method of the Thread class starts a new thread of execution. The new thread begins execution of a separate call stack.\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"file.txt\"));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\nreader.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The readLine() method of the BufferedReader class reads a line of text. It returns null if the end of the stream has been reached.\nQuestion: How to write to a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: BufferedWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(\"file.txt\"));\nwriter.write(\"Hello, World!\");\nwriter.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The write() method of the BufferedWriter class writes text to the file. The text is not automatically written out to the file; the write() method does not automatically flush the output buffer.\nQuestion: How to handle exceptions in Java?\nPlease using this api: try-catch-finally.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: try-catch-finally\n<<<code>>>: try {\n    // code that may throw an exception\n} catch (ExceptionType name) {\n    // code to handle the exception\n} finally {\n    // code to be executed regardless of whether an exception occurred\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The try-catch-finally statement is used to handle exceptions in Java. The try block contains a set of statements where an exception can occur. The catch block contains a set of statements that handle the exception. The finally block contains a set of statements that are always executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred.\nQuestion: How to create a new instance of a class in Java?\nPlease using this api: new.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: new\n<<<code>>>: MyClass instance = new MyClass();\n<<<explanation>>>: The new keyword in Java is used to create a new instance of a class. The new keyword allocates memory for a new object and invokes the class's constructor.\nQuestion: How to create a new instance of an interface in Java?\nPlease using this api: new.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: new\n<<<code>>>: MyInterface instance = new MyClass();\n<<<explanation>>>: In Java, an interface is a reference type, similar to a class. It can be used as a type for variables and parameters, and it can also be used to create instances of classes that implement the interface. The new keyword is used to create a new instance of a class that implements the interface.\nQuestion: How to create a new instance of an abstract class in Java?\nPlease using this api: new.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: new\n<<<code>>>: MyAbstractClass instance = new MyConcreteClass();\n<<<explanation>>>: An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated. However, it can be subclassed and its subclasses can be instantiated. The new keyword is used to create a new instance of a subclass of the abstract class.\nQuestion: How"}
