Here is an example:\n\n```java\nimport java.io.BufferedReader;\nimport java.io.FileReader;\nimport java.io.IOException;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"path_to_your_file\"))) {\n            String line;\n            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n                System.out.println(line);\n            }\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, we're creating a new BufferedReader that reads from a FileReader. The FileReader is connected to the file at the specified path. We then enter a loop where we read each line of the file with br.readLine() and print it to the console. The loop continues until br.readLine() returns null, which indicates the end of the file.\n\nRemember to replace \"path_to_your_file\" with the actual path to your file.\n\nAlso, make sure to handle the IOException that can be thrown by the BufferedReader. In this example, we're simply printing the stack trace to the console.\n\nThis is a basic example. Depending on your"}
