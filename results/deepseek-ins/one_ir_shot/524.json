I am looking for a cleaner solution.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: \n@Entity\npublic class A {\n    //fields\n    @OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true)\n    @OrderBy(\"id ASC\")\n    private Set<B> b = new LinkedHashSet<>();\n\n    public void addB(B bb) {\n        if (this.b.size() >= 5) {\n            this.b.remove(this.b.iterator().next());\n        }\n        this.b.add(bb);\n    }\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: We are using a LinkedHashSet which maintains the insertion order. In the addB method, we are checking if the size of the set is more than or equal to 5. If yes, we remove the oldest entry (which is the first entry in the set as it is in the order of insertion).\nQuestion: How to create a custom exception in Java?\nPlease using this api: throw new.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: throw new\n<<<code>>>: public class CustomException extends Exception {\n    public CustomException(String message) {\n        super(message);\n    }\n}\n\nthrow new CustomException(\"This is a custom exception\");\n<<<explanation>>>: We are creating a new class that extends the Exception class. The constructor of this class takes a String message and passes it to the superclass's constructor. This allows us to create a custom exception with a message. We then throw this custom exception using the 'throw' keyword.\nQuestion: What is the difference between the '==' and 'equals()' in Java?\nPlease using this api: == and equals()\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: == and equals()\n<<<code>>>: \nint a = 10;\nint b = 10;\nSystem.out.println(a == b); // true\n\nString s1 = new String(\"Hello\");\nString s2 = new String(\"Hello\");\nSystem.out.println(s1 == s2); // false\nSystem.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); // true\n<<<explanation>>>: '==' is a comparison operator in Java that checks if the two references point to the same location. It's called the \"reference equality\" comparison.\n\nOn the other hand, 'equals()' is a method that checks if the two objects are equal. It's called the \"value equality\" comparison. The 'equals()' method is overridden in the String class to compare the values of the strings.\n\nIn the example, a == b is true because both variables point to the same location. However, s1 == s2 is false because s1 and s2 are two different String objects and hence, they are not the same location in memory. But s1.equals(s2) is true because the 'equals()' method compares the values of the strings, which are the same in this case.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n"}
