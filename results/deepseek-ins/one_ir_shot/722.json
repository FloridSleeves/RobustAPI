The character to be written is the one that is converted into a char from the int parameter. The character is encoded using the platform's default charset. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I read a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"file.txt\"));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\nreader.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The readLine method of the BufferedReader class reads a line of text. A line is considered to be terminated by any one of a line feed ('\\n'), a carriage return ('\\r'), or a carriage return followed immediately by a line feed. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I write to a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.println.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.println\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"file.txt\", \"UTF-8\");\nwriter.println(\"Hello, World!\");\nwriter.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The println method of the PrintWriter class prints a line and then terminates the line. The string to be printed is converted to characters using the platform's default charset. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I sort an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.sort.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.sort\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {5, 2, 8, 6, 1};\nArrays.sort(array);\n<<<explanation>>>: The sort method of the Arrays class sorts the specified array of objects into ascending numerical order. This is a stable sort. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the maximum value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint max = Arrays.stream(array).max().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The max() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalInt that represents the maximum element of this stream. This is a short-circuiting terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the minimum value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint min = Arrays.stream(array).min().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The min() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalInt that represents the minimum element of this stream. This is a short-circuiting terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the average of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\ndouble average = Arrays.stream(array).average().getAsDouble();\n<<<explanation>>>: The average() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalDouble that represents the average of the elements of this stream. This is a short-circuiting terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the sum of the squares of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sumOfSquares = Arrays.stream(array).map(x -> x * x).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The"}
