Have read a txt file with a buffer reader and trying to use a StringTokenizer.The string i have it like this, where some text first and some numbers after. I only need to numbers, and want to skip \"Text\".Test 2 5 1My code:// Check if the graph contains an cycle    StringTokenizer st1 = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());    Graph.checkForCycle(null, Integer.parseInt(st1.()), Integer.parseInt(st1.nextToken()), Integer.parseInt(st1.nextToken()));      As you can see there are 4 sets here and i want the last 3 to be send with the paramenter when i call the method Graph.checkForCycle()Hope someone can help.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.
