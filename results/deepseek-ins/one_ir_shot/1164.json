This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I read a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: \nBufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"file.txt\"));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The readLine() method of the BufferedReader class reads a line of text. It returns null if the end of the stream has been reached. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I write to a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: BufferedWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: \nBufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(\"file.txt\"));\nbw.write(\"Hello, World!\");\nbw.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The write() method of the BufferedWriter class writes text to the file. This is a void method and does not return anything. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I handle exceptions in Java?\nPlease using this api: try-catch-finally.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: try-catch-finally\n<<<code>>>: \ntry {\n    // Code that may throw an exception\n} catch (ExceptionType name) {\n    // Code to handle the exception\n} finally {\n    // Code to be executed regardless of whether an exception occurred\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The try-catch-finally block is used to handle exceptions in Java. The try block contains the code that may throw an exception. The catch block contains the code to handle the exception. The finally block contains the code to be executed regardless of whether an exception occurred.\nQuestion: How can I create a new file in Java?\nPlease using this api: File.createNewFile.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: File.createNewFile\n<<<code>>>: \nFile file = new File(\"file.txt\");\ntry {\n    if (file.createNewFile()) {\n        System.out.println(\"File created successfully\");\n    } else {\n        System.out.println(\"File already exists\");\n    }\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The createNewFile() method of the File class creates a new file if it does not exist. It returns true if the file was created successfully, and false if the file already exists. This is a void method and does not return anything. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I delete a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: File.delete.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: File.delete\n<<<code>>>: \nFile file = new File(\"file.txt\");\nif (file.delete()) {\n    System.out.println(\"File deleted successfully\");\n} else {\n    System.out.println(\"Failed to delete the file\");\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The delete() method of the File class deletes the file denoted by this abstract pathname. This is a void method and does not return anything. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I rename a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: File.renameTo.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: File.renameTo\n<<<code>>>: \nFile oldFile = new File(\"old.txt\");\nFile newFile = new File(\"new.txt\");\nif (oldFile.renameTo(newFile)) {\n    System.out.println(\"File renamed successfully\");\n} else {\n    System.out.println(\"Failed to rename the file\");\n}\n<<<explan"}
