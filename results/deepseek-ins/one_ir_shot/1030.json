The difference between the two lies in the context they are called in. Static methods are called on the class itself, without needing to instantiate an object of the class. Non-static methods, on the other hand, are called on an instance of the class. Static methods can't access instance variables or instance methods directly. They can only access static variables or static methods. Non-static methods can access both instance variables and instance methods.\n\n\nA: Question: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nAnswer:\n<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: \nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.

The string tokenizer uses the delimiter set in the constructor of this string tokenizer to determine where the tokens begin and end. In your case, you are setting \"/()\" as the delimiter, which means it will ignore everything inside the parentheses.\n\nQuestion: What is the difference between a static and non-static method in Java?\nAnswer:\n<<<api>>>: Static and non-static methods\n<<<code>>>: \n<<<explanation>>>: In Java, methods can be declared as static or non-static.
