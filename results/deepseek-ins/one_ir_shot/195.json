If I use a DataInputStream instead, its got the values from the filereturn info;}\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: int read = stream.read(content);\n<<<explanation>>>: The read() method of the InputStream class reads some number of bytes from the input stream and stores them into the buffer array b. The method returns the total number of bytes read into the buffer, or -1 if there is no more data because the end of the stream has been reached.\nQuestion: How can I read a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.readAllBytes.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.readAllBytes\n<<<code>>>: byte[] bytes = Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get(\"path/to/file\"));\n<<<explanation>>>: The readAllBytes method reads all the bytes from a file into a byte array. This method is suitable for reading all bytes from a file because it does not skip any bytes.\nQuestion: How can I write a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.write\n<<<code>>>: Files.write(Paths.get(\"path/to/file\"), \"Hello, World!\".getBytes());\n<<<explanation>>>: The write method writes bytes to a file. If the file does not exist, it is created. If it does exist, it is overwritten.\nQuestion: How can I read a file line by line in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.lines.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.lines\n<<<code>>>: try (Stream<String> stream = Files.lines(Paths.get(\"path/to/file\"))) {\n    stream.forEach(System.out::println);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The lines method returns a Stream<String> that yields the lines of the file. The lines are read from the file in the order they are found. This method does not support the use of a charset to decode the bytes in the file.\nQuestion: How can I read a file line by line in Java?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: try (BufferedReader br = Files.newBufferedReader(Paths.get(\"path/to/file\"))) {\n    String line;\n    while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n        System.out.println(line);\n    }\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The readLine method reads a line of text from the file. A line is considered to be terminated by any one of a line feed ('\\n'), a carriage return ('\\r'), or a carriage return followed immediately by a line feed.\nQuestion: How can I read a file line by line in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.newBufferedReader.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.newBufferedReader\n<<<code>>>: try (BufferedReader br = Files.newBufferedReader(Paths.get(\"path/to/file\"))) {\n    String line;\n    while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n        System.out.println(line);\n    }\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The newBufferedReader method returns a new buffered reader that reads text from the specified file. The buffer size is initially set to 8192 characters.\nQuestion: How can I read a file line by line in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.lines.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.lines\n<<<code>>>: try (Stream<String> stream = Files.lines(Paths.get(\"path/to/file\"))) {\n    stream.forEach(System.out::println);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The lines method returns a Stream<String> that yields the lines of the file. The lines are read from the file in the order they are found. This method does not support the use of a charset to decode the bytes in the file.\n\n\nA: You can use the Files.lines method to read a file line by line in Java. Here is an example:\n\n```java\nPath path = Paths.get(\"path/to/file\");\ntry (Stream<String> lines = Files.lines(path)) {\n    lines.forEach(System.out::println);\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n"}
