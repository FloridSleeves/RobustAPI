The encoding used is UTF-8. The resultant byte array can be different based on the encoding used. In your case, you are using \"utf-8\" which is a variable length encoding and can result in different byte arrays for the same string.\nQuestion: What is the difference between the \"==\" operator and the equals() method in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: == and equals()\n<<<code>>>: int a = 1;\nint b = 1;\nString s1 = new String(\"test\");\nString s2 = new String(\"test\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The \"==\" operator compares the references of the objects. It checks if both variables point to the same object. In your case, a and b are integers and they are pointing to the same location in memory, so \"a == b\" will return true.\nFor the equals() method, it compares the actual content of the objects. It checks if the content of both variables is the same. In your case, s1 and s2 are Strings and their content is the same, so \"s1.equals(s2)\" will return true.\n\nPlease note that the \"==\" operator can be used to compare primitive types like int, float, etc., and the equals() method can be used to compare objects.\n\nQuestion: What is the difference between the \"==\" operator and the equals() method in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: == and equals()\n<<<code>>>: int a = 1;\nint b = 1;\nString s1 = new String(\"test\");\nString s2 = new String(\"test\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The \"==\" operator compares the references of the objects.
