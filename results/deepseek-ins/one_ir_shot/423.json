But when it returns true (so it finds what I look for), it should perform the code on the previous and the next item.

Clarification: I have java.awt.Component elements!\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: Iterator<Component> iterator = getComponents().iterator();\nComponent previous = null;\nComponent current = iterator.next();\nwhile(iterator.hasNext()) {\n    Component next = iterator.next();\n    //do something with previous, current and next\n    previous = current;\n    current = next;\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The next() method of the Iterator interface returns the next element in the iteration. This method may be called repeatedly to get the next element in the iteration.\nQuestion: How can I get the last element of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nOptionalInt max = Arrays.stream(array).max();\n<<<explanation>>>: The max() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalInt describing the maximum element of this stream, or an empty Optional if this stream is empty. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I get the first element of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nOptionalInt min = Arrays.stream(array).min();\n<<<explanation>>>: The min() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalInt describing the minimum element of this stream, or an empty Optional if this stream is empty. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I check if an array contains a specific element?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nboolean contains = Arrays.stream(array).anyMatch(i -> i == 3);\n<<<explanation>>>: The anyMatch() method of the IntStream class returns whether any elements of this stream match the provided predicate. This is a short-circuiting terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I count the number of elements in an array?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nlong count = Arrays.stream(array).count();\n<<<explanation>>>: The count() method of the Stream interface returns the count of elements in this stream. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I sort an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {5, 2, 3, 1, 4};\nint[] sortedArray = Arrays.stream(array).sorted().toArray();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sorted() method of the IntStream class returns a stream consisting of the elements of this stream, sorted according to natural order. This is a intermediate operation.\nQuestion: How can I reverse an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint[] reversedArray = IntStream.range(0, array.length).map(i -> array[array.length - i - 1]).toArray();\n<<<explanation>>>: The map() method of the IntStream class returns a stream consisting of the results of applying the given function to the elements of this stream. This is a intermediate operation.\n\n\nA: Here is how you can refer to the previous and next item during an iteration using Java 8 Streams:\n\n```java\nList<Component> components = getComponents();\n\nfor (int i = 1; i < components.size() - 1; i++) {\n    Component previous = components.get(i - 1);\n    Component current = components.get(i);\n    Component next = components.get(i + 1);\n    // do something with previous,"}
