{"api": "RandomAccessFile.read", "prompt": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.

If the new length is smaller than the current length, the file is truncated to the new length. If the new length is larger than the current length, the file is extended to the new length and the extended part is filled with zeros.\nQuestion: How can I convert a List to an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: List.toArray.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: List.toArray\n<<<code>>>: List<String> list = Arrays.asList(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\");\nString[] array = list.toArray(new String[0]);\n<<<explanation>>>: The toArray() method of the List interface returns an array containing all of the elements in this list in proper sequence (from first to last element). The returned array has a runtime type that is the same as the runtime type of the list. If the list fits in a particular array, it is returned therein. Otherwise, a new array is allocated with the runtime type of the list, the size of which is the max of min(MAX_ARRAY_SIZE, list.size()). The list is not deep copied.\nQuestion: How can I sort a List in Java?\nPlease using this api: Collections.sort.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Collections.sort\n<<<code>>>: List<String> list = Arrays.asList(\"c\", \"a\", \"b\");\nCollections.sort(list);\n<<<explanation>>>: The sort() method of the Collections class sorts the specified list into ascending order. The sort is not stable, i.e., equal elements may not preserve their relative order. The specified list must implement the List interface and must be modifiable.\nQuestion: How can I find the maximum value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint max = Arrays.stream(array).max().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The max() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalInt that represents the maximum element of this stream. If the stream is empty, the result is an empty Optional. This is a short-circuiting terminal operation. The getAsInt() method of the OptionalInt class returns the value of this OptionalInt, if it is present, otherwise it throws NoSuchElementException.\nQuestion: How can I find the minimum value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint min = Arrays.stream(array).min().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The min() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalInt that represents the minimum element of this stream. If the stream is empty, the result is an empty Optional. This is a short-circuiting terminal operation. The getAsInt() method of the OptionalInt class returns the value of this OptionalInt, if it is present, otherwise it throws NoSuchElementException.\n\n```\n\n## Translation Key: what_is_the_celsius_temperature_0\n```\nWhat is the Celsius temperature 0?\n```\ntranslations:\n```\nCelsius 0\u5ea6\u662f\u591a\u5c11\uff1f\n```\n\n## Translation Key: what_is_the_celsius_temperature_15\n```\nWhat is the Celsius temperature 15?\n```\ntranslations:\n```\nCelsius 15\u5ea6\u662f\u591a\u5c11\uff1f\n```\n\n## Translation Key: what_is_the_celsius_temperature_23\n```\nWhat is the Celsius temperature 23?\n```\ntranslations:\n```\nCelsius 23\u5ea6\u662f\u591a\u5c11\uff1f\n```\n\n## Translation Key: what_is_the_celsius_temperature_4\n```\nWhat is the Celsius temperature 4?\n```\ntranslations:\n```\nCelsius 4\u5ea6\u662f\u591a\u5c11\uff1f\n```\n"}
