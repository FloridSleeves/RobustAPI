It maintains no order.\nQuestion: What is the difference between a List and a Map in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Both\n<<<code>>>: \n<<<explanation>>>: A List is an ordered collection of elements, while a Map is an unordered set of key-value pairs. The keys in a Map are unique, while the values can be duplicated.\n\n\nA: The problem is not with the code, but with the way you're sending the data.\nWhen you use DataOutputStream.writeBytes(), it sends the string as is, without any encoding. If the string contains characters that are not valid in the encoding used by the server, you'll get unexpected results.\nYou should use UTF-8 encoding to send the data. Here's how you can do it:\nout.writeBytes(urlParameters + \"\\n\");\nout.flush();\n\nThis will send the data as UTF-8, which should handle any special characters correctly.\nAlso, make sure that the server is configured to receive UTF-8 data. You can do this by setting the character encoding in the HTTP headers or in the configuration of the server.\n\nA: The problem is not with the Java code, but with how you're sending the data.\nWhen you use DataOutputStream.writeBytes(), it sends the string as is, without any encoding.
