The character to be written is given as an integer.

In your code, you have declared an array of Strings named items but you have not initialized it.\nYou can initialize it in the constructor of your StringPrinter class like this:\npublic StringPrinter(String fileName) {\n    file = new File(fileName);\n    items = new String[2]; // Initialize the items array\n}\n\nAlso, you should initialize the items array in the main method before you try to access its elements:\npublic static void main(String args[]) {\n    StringPrinter some = new StringPrinter(\"Workyou.txt\");\n    some.items[0] = \"Testing One!\";\n    some.items[1] = \"Testing Two!\";\n    some.toFile();\n}\n\nThis way, you will avoid the NullPointerException.\n\nA: You are getting a NullPointerException because you are trying to access an array element that has not been initialized.\nIn your code, you have declared an array of Strings named items but you have not initialized it.\nYou can initialize it in the constructor of your StringPrinter class like this:\npublic StringPrinter(String fileName) {\n    file = new File(fileName);\n    items = new String[2]; // Initialize the items array\n}\n\nAlso, you should initialize the items array in the main method before you try to access its elements:\npublic static void main(String args[]) {\n    StringPrinter some = new StringPrinter(\"Workyou.txt\");\n    some.items[0] = \"Testing One!\";\n    some.items[1] = \"Testing Two!\";\n    some.toFile();\n}\n\nThis way, you will avoid the NullPointerException.\n\nA: The NullPointerException is thrown because you are trying to access an array element that has not been initialized.
