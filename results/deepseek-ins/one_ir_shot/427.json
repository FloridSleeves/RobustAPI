This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Idiom for getting unique pairs of collection elements in Java: :Is there a standard idiom for getting a set of each unique pair of elements in a given Collection?  For our purposes, the set of (a,b) is equivalent to (b,a), and thus only one should appear in the resulting set.I can see how one might construct such a set using a Pair class that implements hashCode and equals() based on the paired elements, but I'm wondering if there isn't already a more standard way to generate such a set.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.

This is a standard way to iterate over a collection in Java. In this code, we use it to get each pair of elements in the collection. We add each pair to a HashSet, which automatically removes duplicates.\nQuestion: How can I find the maximum value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint max = Arrays.stream(array).max().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The max() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalInt that represents the maximum element of this stream. The getAsInt() method is used to get the value from the OptionalInt. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the minimum value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint min = Arrays.stream(array).min().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The min() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalInt that represents the minimum element of this stream. The getAsInt() method is used to get the value from the OptionalInt. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the average of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\ndouble average = Arrays.stream(array).average().getAsDouble();\n<<<explanation>>>: The average() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalDouble that represents the average of elements of this stream. The getAsDouble() method is used to get the value from the OptionalDouble. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I count the number of elements in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nlong count = Arrays.stream(array).count();\n<<<explanation>>>: The count() method of the Stream interface returns the count of elements in this stream. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I sort an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {5, 2, 3, 1, 4};\narray = Arrays.stream(array).sorted().toArray();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sorted() method of the IntStream class returns a sorted view of this stream. The toArray() method is used to convert the stream to an array. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I reverse an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\narray = IntStream.range(0, array.length).map(i -> array[array.length - i - 1]).toArray();\n<<<explanation>>>: The range() method of the IntStream class returns an IntStream that consists of a sequence of int values. The map() method is used to transform each element of the stream. The toArray() method is used to convert the stream to an array. This is"}
