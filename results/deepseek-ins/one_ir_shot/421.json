Currently I simply iterate thru the list looking and establish comms with a host to check its not busy. If not I will send a job to it. This approach tends to mean that the first host in the list tends to get hot constanly with the load not balanced properly with the rest of the available hosts.in pseudocode ..for (Host h : hosts) {    //checkstatus    if status == job accepted break;}I'd like to balance this load properly between the hosts i.e first time host one is used 2nd time the method is used host 2. Just wondering that the most elegant solution to this is ??ThanksW\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.

The sort is stable, i.e., equal elements remain in their original order. This is a stable, non-concurrent, general-purpose sort. This is a stable, mutating sort.\nQuestion: How can I create a new array with the elements of another array reversed?\nPlease using this api: System.arraycopy.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: System.arraycopy\n<<<code>>>: int[] original = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint[] reversed = new int[original.length];\nSystem.arraycopy(original, 0, reversed, 0, original.length);\nfor (int i = 0; i < original.length / 2; i++) {\n    int temp = reversed[i];\n    reversed[i] = reversed[original.length - i - 1];\n    reversed[original.length - i - 1] = temp;\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The arraycopy() method of the System class copies an array from one position to another. The arraycopy() method throws an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if srcPos is greater than equal to destination.length or if destPos is greater than equal to src.length. This is a non-terminal operation.\n\n\nA: Here is the answer to your question:\n\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.
