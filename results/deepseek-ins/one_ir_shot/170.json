The value byte is returned as an int in the range 0 to 255. If no byte is available because the end of the stream has been reached, the value -1 is returned. This is a blocking operation.\nQuestion: How can I read a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.readAllLines.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.readAllLines\n<<<code>>>: List<String> lines = Files.readAllLines(Paths.get(\"myfile.txt\"));\nfor (String line : lines) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The readAllLines method returns a list of strings, where each string is a line from the file. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I write to a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.write\n<<<code>>>: Files.write(Paths.get(\"myfile.txt\"), \"Hello, World!\".getBytes(), StandardOpenOption.CREATE);\n<<<explanation>>>: The write method writes the specified bytes to this file. The file is created if it does not exist. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I append to a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.write\n<<<code>>>: Files.write(Paths.get(\"myfile.txt\"), \"Hello, World!\".getBytes(), StandardOpenOption.APPEND);\n<<<explanation>>>: The write method writes the specified bytes to this file. If the file does not exist, it is created. If it does exist, then bytes are appended to the end of the file. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I read a file line by line in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.lines.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.lines\n<<<code>>>: Files.lines(Paths.get(\"myfile.txt\")).forEach(System.out::println);\n<<<explanation>>>: The lines method returns a Stream<String> that represents the lines of the file. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I check if a file exists in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.exists.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.exists\n<<<code>>>: boolean exists = Files.exists(Paths.get(\"myfile.txt\"), LinkOption.NOFOLLOW_LINKS);\n<<<explanation>>>: The exists method checks whether the file or directory denoted by this path exists. If the file system implementation supports symbolic links, then the option NOFOLLOW_LINKS can be used to determine whether the symbolic link itself exists, not the file or directory it refers to. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I get the size of a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.size.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.size\n<<<code>>>: long size = Files.size(Paths.get(\"myfile.txt\"));\n<<<explanation>>>: The size method returns the size of the file denoted by this path. This is a terminal operation. The size is returned in bytes.\nQuestion: How can I delete a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.delete.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.delete\n<<<code>>>: Files.delete(Paths.get(\"myfile.txt\"));\n<<<explanation>>>: The delete method deletes the file or directory denoted by this path. If the file or directory does not exist, then no action is performed. If the file or directory exists but is not a directory, then it is deleted. If the file or directory exists and is a directory, then it must be empty in order to be deleted. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I list all files in a directory in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.list.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.list\n<<<code>>>: Files."}
