I want to enforce this rule during construction of this object so that you can't create a map with values that aren't either of those.e.g.class Record {  public Record(String key, Map<String,Object> attrs) {    // check that attrs only contains Objects which are Strings or List<Strings>  }}Other ways I have thought of to solve the problem might be...1)class Record {  public Record(String key, Map<String,String> attrs, Map<String,List<String>> multiAttrs) {    // ...  }}2)class Record {  public Record(String key, Map<String,Value> attrs) {    // ...  }}class Value {  // Create some funky class that encapsulates lists.  // Perhaps returning the only element in the list if the size is 1,  // but returning the list otherwise}I am not immediately excited at the alternatives, but I'm just putting it there as stuff I've already considered.

Really I want the distinction between Strings and List to be transparent to the user of the class.\nPlease using this api: List.get.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: List.get\n<<<code>>>: List<Object> list = new ArrayList<>();\nlist.add(\"Hello\");\nlist.add(Arrays.asList(\"World\", \"!\"))\nString str = (String) list.get(0);\nList<String> strList = (List<String>) list.get(1);\n<<<explanation>>>: The get() method of the List interface returns the element at the specified position in this list. Note that this method does not perform any range checking. If you pass an index that is outside the bounds of the list, it will throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.\nQuestion: How can I convert a string to an integer in Java?\nPlease using this api: Integer.parseInt.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Integer.parseInt\n<<<code>>>: String str = \"123\";\nint num = Integer.parseInt(str);\n<<<explanation>>>: The parseInt() method of the Integer class parses the specified String argument as a signed decimal integer. The characters in the string must all be decimal digits, except that the first character may be an ASCII minus sign '-' to indicate a negative value. The resulting integer value is returned.\nQuestion: How can I convert a string to a float in Java?\nPlease using this api: Float.parseFloat.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Float.parseFloat\n<<<code>>>: String str = \"123.45\";\nfloat num = Float.parseFloat(str);\n<<<explanation>>>: The parseFloat() method of the Float class parses the specified String argument as a floating-point number. The characters in the string must all be decimal digits, except that the first character may be an ASCII minus sign '-' to indicate a negative value. The resulting float value is returned.\nQuestion: How can I convert a string to a double in Java?\nPlease using this api: Double.parseDouble.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Double.parseDouble\n<<<code>>>: String str = \"123.456\";\ndouble num = Double.parseDouble(str);\n<<<explanation>>>: The parseDouble() method of the Double class parses the specified String argument as a double. The characters in the string must all be decimal digits, except that the first character may be an ASCII minus sign '-' to indicate a negative value. The resulting double value is returned.\nQuestion: How can I convert an integer to a string in Java?\nPlease using this api: Integer.toString.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Integer.toString\n<<<code>>>: int num = 123;\nString str = Integer.toString(num);\n<<<explanation>>>: The toString() method of the Integer class returns a String object representing the specified integer. In other words, this method converts an int to a String.\nQuestion: How can I convert a float to a string in Java?\nPlease using this api: Float.toString.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Float.toString\n<<<code>>>: float num = 123.45f;\nString str = Float.toString(num);\n<<<explanation>>>: The toString() method of the Float class returns a String object representing the specified float. In other words, this method converts a float to a String.\nQuestion: How can I convert a double to a string in Java?\nPlease using this api: Double.toString.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Double.toString\n<<<code>>>: double num = 123.456;\nString str = Double.toString(num);\n<<<explanation>>>: The toString() method of the Double class returns a String object representing the specified double. In other words, this method converts a double to a String.\n\n\nA: The API you're looking for is the toString() method. \n\ntoString() is a method of the Object class in Java. It returns a string representation of the object. The string representation is not necessarily human-readable, but it can be used for debugging purposes.\n\nHere's an example:\n\nObject obj = new Object();\nString str = obj.toString();\n\nIn this example, str will be a string representation of the object.\n\nFor your other questions, you can use the parseInt(), parseFloat(), parseDouble() methods to convert a string to an integer, float, or double respectively."}
