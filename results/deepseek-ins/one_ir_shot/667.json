It's a lightweight framework that provides a simple and elegant way to create web applications. In this example, a GET request to the '/hello' route will return 'Hello world!'\nQuestion: How to create a simple RESTful API using Spring Boot?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Spring Boot\n<<<code>>>: import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;\nimport org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;\n\n@RestController\npublic class HelloController {\n\n    @GetMapping(\"/hello\")\n    public String sayHello() {\n        return \"Hello World\";\n    }\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: Spring Boot is a framework for building web applications. It provides a simple and straightforward approach to creating stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications. The @RestController annotation is used to define a controller. The @GetMapping annotation is used to map a GET request onto a specific handler method. In this example, a GET request to the '/hello' route will return 'Hello World'.\n```\n\n## AI's answer:\n```\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nAnswer: You can use the Arrays.stream API in Java to calculate the sum of an array. Here is an example:\n\n```java\nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n```\n\nIn this code, `Arrays.stream(array)` creates a stream from the array, and the `sum()` method calculates the sum of the elements in the stream.\n\nQuestion: Receiving Data On Sinatra Server: \nAnswer: In Sinatra, you can receive data from a client by defining a route that accepts a POST request. Here is an example:\n\n```ruby\npost '/hello' do\n  data = request.body.read\n  # Now you can use the data variable in your code\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, a POST request to the '/hello' route will read the body of the request and store it in the `data` variable.\n\nQuestion: How to create a simple RESTful API using Sinatra?\nAnswer: Sinatra is a DSL for quickly creating web applications in Ruby.
