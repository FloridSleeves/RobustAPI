It is a legacy class that is recommended for use only in applications designed for early Java platforms. Beginning with JDK 1.1, the recommended approach for breaking a string into tokens is to use the java.util.StringTokenizer class.\nQuestion: How to sort a HashMap by values in Java?\nPlease using this api: Streams.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Streams\n<<<code>>>: Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();\nmap.put(\"one\", 1);\nmap.put(\"two\", 2);\nmap.put(\"three\", 3);\nmap.put(\"four\", 4);\nmap.put(\"five\", 5);\n\nMap<String, Integer> sortedMap = map.entrySet()\n                .stream()\n                .sorted(Map.Entry.comparingByValue())\n                .collect(Collectors.toMap(Map.Entry::getKey, Map.Entry::getValue, (e1, e2) -> e2, LinkedHashMap::new));\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The sorted() method of the Stream API is used to sort the elements of a stream. The sorted() method takes a Comparator to compare the elements. The Map.Entry.comparingByValue() method returns a Comparator that compares the values of two Map.Entry objects. The sorted() method returns a Stream consisting of the elements of the original stream, sorted according to the provided Comparator. The collect() method is used to convert the sorted stream back into a Map. The LinkedHashMap constructor is used to create a LinkedHashMap that preserves the order of elements.\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: FileInputStream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileInputStream\n<<<code>>>: FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(\"file.txt\");\nbyte[] data = new byte[fis.available()];\nfis.read(data);\nfis.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The FileInputStream class is used to read data from a file. The read() method of the FileInputStream class is used to read the data from the file. The available() method of the FileInputStream class is used to find out how many bytes are available in the file. The close() method of the FileInputStream class is used to close the file.\nQuestion: How to write to a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: FileOutputStream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileOutputStream\n<<<code>>>: FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(\"file.txt\");\nString data = \"Hello, World!\";\nfos.write(data.getBytes());\nfos.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The FileOutputStream class is used to write data to a file. The write() method of the FileOutputStream class is used to write data to the file. The close() method of the FileOutputStream class is used to close the file.\nQuestion: How to read a file line by line in Java?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"file.txt\"));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\nbr.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The BufferedReader class is used to read text from a character-input stream, buffering characters so as to provide for the efficient reading of characters, arrays, and lines. The readLine() method of the BufferedReader class is used to read a line of text. The while loop is used to read all lines of the file. The close() method of the BufferedReader class is used to close the reader.\nQuestion: How to write to a file line by line in Java?\nPlease using this api: BufferedWriter.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedWriter\n<<<code>>>: BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(\"file.txt\"));\nbw.write(\"Hello, World"}
