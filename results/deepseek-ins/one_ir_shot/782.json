The string is interpreted as a sequence of Unicode characters.

A line is considered to be terminated by any one of a line feed ('\\n'), a carriage return ('\\r'), or a carriage return followed immediately by a line feed. This is a terminal operation.\n\n\nA: Your code is almost correct. The problem is that you are trying to create a directory and a file at the same time. The mkdir() method is used to create a directory, not a file. If you want to create a file, you should use createNewFile() method.\nHere is the corrected code:\nimport java.io.*;\n\nclass PS_Task1 {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        try {\n            File file = new File(\"Library\\\\test.txt\");\n            if (file.getParentFile().mkdirs()) {\n                System.out.println(\"Directory created\");\n            }\n            if (file.createNewFile()) {\n                System.out.println(\"File created\");\n            }\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            System.out.println(\"Exception: \" + e.getMessage());\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThis code will create the directory \"Library\" if it doesn't exist, and then create the file \"test.txt\" in this directory. The getParentFile() method returns the parent File object of the File object. The mkdirs() method creates the directory and any necessary parent directories.\nFor writing to a file, you can use PrintWriter:\nPrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"Library\\\\test.txt\", \"UTF-8\");\nwriter.println(\"Hello, World!\");\nwriter.close();\n\nThis will write the string \"Hello, World!\" to the file. The println() method writes a line to the output stream.\nFor reading a file, you can use BufferedReader:\nBufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"Library\\\\test.txt\"));\nString line = reader.readLine();\nSystem.out.println(line);\nreader.close();\n\nThis will read the first line of the file and print it to the console. The readLine() method reads a line of text.\n\nA: Here is the corrected code:\nimport java.io.*;\n\nclass PS_Task1 {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        try {\n            File file = new File(\"Library/test.txt\");\n            if (file.getParentFile().mkdirs()) {\n                System.out.println(\"Directory created\");\n            }\n            if (file.createNewFile()) {\n                System.out.println(\"File created\");\n            }\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            System.out.println(\"Exception: \" + e.getMessage());\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThis code will create the directory \"Library\" if it doesn't exist, and then create the file \"test.txt\" in this directory.

The println() method writes a line to the output stream.\nFor reading a file, you can use BufferedReader:\nBufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"Library/test.txt\"));\nString line = reader.readLine();"}
