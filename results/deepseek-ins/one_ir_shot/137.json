It returns a boolean value indicating whether the directory was created or not.\nQuestion: How to convert a string to a date in Java?\nPlease using this api: SimpleDateFormat.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: SimpleDateFormat\n<<<code>>>: SimpleDateFormat formatter = new SimpleDateFormat(\"dd-MM-yyyy\");\nString dateInString = \"31-08-1988\";\nDate date = formatter.parse(dateInString);\n<<<explanation>>>: The parse() method of the SimpleDateFormat class is used to convert a string to a date. The string should be in the format specified in the SimpleDateFormat object.\nQuestion: How to get the current date and time in Java?\nPlease using this api: Instant.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Instant\n<<<code>>>: Instant now = Instant.now();\n<<<explanation>>>: The now() method of the Instant class returns the current date and time. It returns an Instant representing the current time in the system's UTC clock.\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader\n<<<code>>>: File file = new File(\"path/to/file.txt\");\nBufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The BufferedReader class in Java is used to read the content from a character-input stream. It buffers characters so as to provide for the efficient reading of characters, arrays, and lines.\nQuestion: How to write to a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: BufferedWriter.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedWriter\n<<<code>>>: File file = new File(\"path/to/file.txt\");\nBufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(file));\nbw.write(\"Hello, World!\");\nbw.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The BufferedWriter class in Java is used for writing character-output streams to a text-based character output stream. It buffers characters so as to provide for the efficient writing of characters, arrays, and strings.\nQuestion: How to handle exceptions in Java?\nPlease using this api: try-catch-finally.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: try-catch-finally\n<<<code>>>: try {\n    // code that may throw an exception\n} catch (ExceptionType name) {\n    // code to handle the exception\n} finally {\n    // code to be executed regardless of whether an exception occurred\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The try-catch-finally block in Java is used to handle exceptions. The try block contains the code that may throw an exception, the catch block contains the code to handle the exception, and the finally block contains the code to be executed regardless of whether an exception occurred.\n\n\nA: Here is the answer to your question:\n\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\n\nAnswer:\n<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\n\nIn the code snippet, we are using the Arrays.stream() method to convert the array into a Stream. Then we call the sum() method on the stream to calculate the sum of its elements. The result is stored in the variable 'sum'.\n\nQuestion: Mkdir in Shell Script not creating folder in mac OS while executing using java: :cmdFile.sh:cd \"E:\\\\myWorkSpace\\\\sampleTest\"mkdir \"E:\\\\myWorkSpace\\\\sampleTest\\output\"Java:runtime.exec(\"cmdFile.sh\");The above shell script creates the folder if executed through a command prompt.
