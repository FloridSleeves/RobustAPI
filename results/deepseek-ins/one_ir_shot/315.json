This method may be called repeatedly to get the next element in the iteration. If there are no more elements in the iteration, a NoSuchElementException is thrown.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Python?\nPlease using this api: sum.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: sum\n<<<code>>>: array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\ntotal = sum(array)\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() function returns the sum of all elements in an iterable.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in JavaScript?\nPlease using this api: reduce.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: reduce\n<<<code>>>: var array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nvar total = array.reduce(function(a, b) {\n    return a + b;\n}, 0);\n<<<explanation>>>: The reduce() method executes a reducer function (that you provide) on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value. The output value is the accumulated result of running the reducer function on all elements in the array. The second argument to reduce is an initial value for the accumulator (in this case 0).\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in C#?\nPlease using this api: Linq.Sum.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Linq.Sum\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint total = array.Sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The Sum() method returns the sum of the elements in a collection.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Ruby?\nPlease using this api: inject.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: inject\n<<<code>>>: array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\ntotal = array.inject(0, :+)\n<<<explanation>>>: The inject method is used to accumulate a value by iterating over an array. The first argument is the initial value, and the second argument is the symbol of the operation to be performed. In this case, the operation is addition (:+).\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Swift?\nPlease using this api: reduce.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: reduce\n<<<code>>>: let array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nlet total = array.reduce(0, +)\n<<<explanation>>>: The reduce(into:_:) method applies a function to all the elements of the collection, in order, using the result of the previous application as the first argument of the next. The second argument is the initial result value. In this case, the function is addition (+).\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in PHP?\nPlease using this api: array_sum.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: array_sum\n<<<code>>>: $array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n$total = array_sum($array);\n<<<explanation>>>: The array_sum() function calculates the sum of values in an array.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Perl?\nPlease using this api: List::Util 'sum'.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: List::Util 'sum'\n<<<code>>>: use List::Util 'sum';\nmy @array = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5);\nmy $total = sum(@array);\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum function returns the sum of all elements in a list.\n```\n\n## AI's answer\n```\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint"}
