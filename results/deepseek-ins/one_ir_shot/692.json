This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Reading a File versus Writing One: :This question is not specific question, but more a general question. For reading a file I know you can use Scanner and read it and then print it. However reading a file and then printing it in a new format, like double space, indents, basically any spacing issues, is that also considered reading it or is it writing it? From my understanding of what my teacher has taught me, is that writing overwrites the original document and replaces it. Also how does one use the PrintWriter command? I have never seen this before in my class nor have read about it in my textbook but its on my test according to my teacher. Could someone give an explanation and an example about it? I read this site http://www.caveofprogramming.com/frontpage/articles/java/java-file-reading-and-writing-files-in-java/ on writing files, but it uses FileWriter, which I'm assuming takes the place of scanner? Is that right?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.

Is that right?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"filename.txt\", \"UTF-8\");\nwriter.write(\"Hello, World!\");\nwriter.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The write() method of the PrintWriter class writes a string to the file. The string is interpreted as a sequence of Unicode characters. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I create a new file in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: File\n<<<code>>>: File file = new File(\"filename.txt\");\nboolean created = file.createNewFile();\n<<<explanation>>>: The createNewFile() method of the File class tries to create a new file with the pathname of this abstract pathname. If the file does not exist, it is created; if it does exist, it is not changed. This method returns true if and only if the file was successfully created. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I read a file line by line in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Scanner.hasNextLine\n<<<code>>>: Scanner scanner = new Scanner(new File(\"filename.txt\"));\nwhile (scanner.hasNextLine()) {\n    String line = scanner.nextLine();\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\nscanner.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The hasNextLine() method of the Scanner class returns true if this scanner has another line in its input. The hasNextLine method may block while waiting for input to scan. This is a query operation.\nQuestion: How can I read a file character by character in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Scanner.hasNext\n<<<code>>>: Scanner scanner = new Scanner(new File(\"filename.txt\"));\nwhile (scanner.hasNext()) {\n    char ch = scanner.next().charAt(0);\n    System.out.println(ch);\n}\nscanner.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The hasNext() method of the Scanner class returns true if this scanner has another token in its input. The hasNext method may block while waiting for input to scan. This is a query operation.\nQuestion: How can I write a string to a file in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.println\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"filename.txt\", \"UTF-8\");\nwriter.println(\"Hello, World!\");\nwriter.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The println() method of the PrintWriter class writes a line of text to the file. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I append a string to a file in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.print or PrintWriter.println\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(\"filename.txt\", true));\nwriter.println(\"Hello, World!\");\nwriter.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The print() and println() methods of the PrintWriter class write formatted representations of objects to the file. The println() method writes a line separator. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I read a file as a string in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.readAllLines\n<<<code>>>: List<String> lines = Files.readAllLines(Paths.get(\"filename.txt\"));\nString content = String.join(\"\\n\", lines);\n<<<explanation>>>: The readAllLines() method of the Files class returns a list of strings, where each string is a line from the file. This is a query operation.\nQuestion: How can I write a string to a file in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.write\n<<<code>>>: Files.write(Paths.get(\"filename.txt\"), \"Hello, World!\".getBytes());\n<<<explanation>>>: The write() method of the Files class writes bytes to a file. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I append a string to a file in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.write\n<<<code>>>: Files.write(Paths.get(\"filename.txt\"), \"Hello, World!\".getBytes(), StandardOpenOption.APPEND);\n<<<explanation>>>: The write() method of the Files class writes bytes to a file.
