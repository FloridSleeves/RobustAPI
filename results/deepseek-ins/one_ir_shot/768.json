The Content-Type is set to \"application/octet-stream\" to indicate that the file is being sent as raw bytes. The file is read into a byte array and written to the output stream of the connection.\nQuestion: How can I create a custom exception in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: class\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\npublic class CustomException extends Exception {\n    public CustomException(String message) {\n        super(message);\n    }\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: This code defines a new exception class named CustomException that extends the built-in Exception class. The constructor of the CustomException class takes a String parameter that is passed to the constructor of the Exception class. This allows you to provide a custom message when an instance of CustomException is created.\nQuestion: How can I create a custom annotation in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: @interface\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\npublic @interface CustomAnnotation {\n    String value();\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: This code defines a new annotation type named CustomAnnotation. The annotation type has a single element named value of type String. This is a simple example of a custom annotation, but you can define more complex ones with multiple elements.\nQuestion: How can I create a custom class loader in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: ClassLoader\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\npublic class CustomClassLoader extends ClassLoader {\n    public CustomClassLoader(ClassLoader parent) {\n        super(parent);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected Class<?> findClass(String name) throws ClassNotFoundException {\n        // Implement your custom class loading logic here\n        throw new ClassNotFoundException();\n    }\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: This code defines a new class loader named CustomClassLoader that extends the built-in ClassLoader class. The findClass() method is overridden to provide custom class loading logic. In this example, it throws a ClassNotFoundException, indicating that the class could not be found. You would replace this with your own logic to load classes.\nQuestion: How can I create a custom thread pool in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Executors.newFixedThreadPool\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);\nfor (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {\n    executor.execute(new Runnable() {\n        public void run() {\n            // Perform task\n        }\n    });\n}\nexecutor.shutdown();\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: This code creates a new fixed thread pool with 10 threads. The Executors.newFixedThreadPool() method returns an ExecutorService that uses a ThreadPoolExecutor to manage the threads. The threads in the pool are created and started when the ExecutorService is created, and they remain active until the ExecutorService is shut down. The tasks are added to the thread pool using the execute() method, which submits them for execution and returns immediately. The tasks are executed by the threads in the pool in the order that they are submitted.\nQuestion: How can I create a custom comparator in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Comparator\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nComparator<String> comparator = new Comparator<String>() {\n    public int compare(String s1, String"}
