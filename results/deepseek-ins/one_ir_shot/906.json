The bytes are encoded in the platform's default charset. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to read a file as bytes in Java:\nPlease using this api: Files.readAllBytes.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.readAllBytes\n<<<code>>>: byte[] bytes = Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get(\"file.txt\"));\n<<<explanation>>>: The readAllBytes method of the Files class returns the contents of the file as a byte array.

If the file does not exist, it is created. If it does exist, it is overwritten. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to read a file as a string in Java:\nPlease using this api: Files.readAllLines.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.readAllLines\n<<<code>>>: String content = Files.readAllLines(Paths.file.txt\").stream().collect(Collectors.joining(System.lineSeparator()));\n<<<explanation>>>: The readAllLines method of the Files class returns a list of strings, where each string is a line from the file.
