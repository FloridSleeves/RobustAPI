The character to be written is given as an integer. This method is overridden by the write(char[] buf, int off, int len) method.\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java?:\nPlease using this api: Files.readAllLines.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.readAllLines\n<<<code>>>: List<String> lines = Files.readAllLines(Paths.get(\"input.txt\"), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);\nfor (String line : lines) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The readAllLines method returns a list of strings where each string is a line from the file. The lines are read using the UTF-8 charset. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to write a file in Java?:\nPlease using this api: Files.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.write\n<<<code>>>: Files.write(Paths.get(\"output.txt\"), \"Hello, World!\".getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8), StandardOpenOption.CREATE);\n<<<explanation>>>: The write method writes the specified bytes to this file. The file is opened using the specified options. If the file does not exist, it is created. If it does exist, it is truncated to zero size. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to read a file line by line in Java?:\nPlease using this api: Files.lines.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.lines\n<<<code>>>: Files.lines(Paths.get(\"input.txt\"), StandardCharsets.UTF_8).forEach(System.out::println);\n<<<explanation>>>: The lines method returns a Stream<String> that yields the lines of this file. The lines are read using the UTF-8 charset. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to write a file line by line in Java?:\nPlease using this api: Files.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.write\n<<<code>>>: List<String> lines = Arrays.asList(\"Hello, World1\", \"Hello, World2\", \"Hello, World3\");\nFiles.write(Paths.get(\"output.txt\"), lines, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);\n<<<explanation>>>: The write method writes the specified lines to this file. The lines are written using the UTF-8 charset. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to read a file as a stream in Java?:\nPlease using this api: Files.lines.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.lines\n<<<code>>>: try (Stream<String> stream = Files.lines(Paths.get(\"input.txt\"), StandardCharsets.UTF_8)) {\n    stream.forEach(System.out::println);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The lines method returns a Stream<String> that yields the lines of this file. The lines are read using the UTF-8 charset. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to write a file as a stream in Java?:\nPlease using this api: Files.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.write\n<<<code>>>: Stream<String> stream = Stream.of(\"Hello, World1\", \"Hello, World2\", \"Hello, World3\");\nFiles.write(Paths.get(\"output.txt\"), (Iterable<String>) stream::iterator, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);\n<<<explanation>>>: The write method writes the specified lines to this file. The lines are written using the UTF-8 charset. This is a terminal operation.\n\n\nA: Here are the answers to your questions:\n\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nAnswer:\n<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: \nint[] array = {1, 2,"}
