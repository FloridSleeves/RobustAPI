This means that you are opening and closing the file in each iteration, which is why you are losing all your data. You should move the closing of the PrintWriter outside of the while loop.\nHere is the corrected code:\nimport java.io.*;\n\npublic class CacheData {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        String target_dir = \"C:\\\\Files\";\n        String output = \"C:\\\\Files\\\\output.txt\";\n        File dir = new File(target_dir);\n        File[] files = dir.listFiles();\n        PrintWriter outputStream = new PrintWriter(output); // Open the file once\n        for (File textfiles : files) {\n            if (textfiles.isFile() && textfiles.getName().endsWith(\".txt\")) {\n                BufferedReader inputStream = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(textfiles));\n                String line;\n                while ((line = inputStream.readLine()) != null) {\n                    System.out.println(line);\n                    outputStream.println(line); // Write to the file\n                }\n                inputStream.close(); // Close the file after reading\n            }\n        }\n        outputStream.close(); // Close the file after writing\n    }\n}\n\nThis code will read all the lines from the text files in the directory, print them to the console, and write them to the output.txt file.\n\nA: Your code is almost correct, but you are closing the PrintWriter in each iteration of the loop.
