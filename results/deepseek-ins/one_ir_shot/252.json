I know the structure from some documentation and would like to use that stream as an ObjectInputStream, but before I can call any self made readObject methods, this approach fails, due to java.io.StreamCorruptedException: invalid stream header. What's the best way to populate java objects from such a byte stream?BTW: Data is coming in as LittleEndian, texts as 16bit chars preceeded by 4 byte size info, e.g.   03 00 00 00 41 00 62 00 63 00   (hex)would result in \"Abc\"\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.

In this case, it is used to convert a byte array to a hexadecimal string. The \"%02X\" format string specifies that each byte should be converted to a two-digit hexadecimal number.\nQuestion: How to convert a hexadecimal string to a byte array in Java?\nPlease using this api: ByteBuffer.wrap.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: ByteBuffer.wrap\n<<<code>>>: String hex = \"0102030405\";\nbyte[] bytes = ByteBuffer.wrap(hex.getBytes()).array();\n<<<explanation>>>: The wrap() method of the ByteBuffer class wraps a byte array into a ByteBuffer. The getBytes() method of the String class is used to convert the hexadecimal string to a byte array. The array() method of the ByteBuffer class is then used to get the byte array from the ByteBuffer.\n\n```\n\n## Answer:\n\n```plaintext\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nAnswer: Arrays.stream\nCode: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\nExplanation: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.
