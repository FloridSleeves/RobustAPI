Unfortunately, cryptography is not my strong side. Now I can write to file several messages and then close file. Then i can open it, append some messages, close again and after decryption I see padding bytes in the middle of file. Is there any way to work with encrypted file without having to decrypt it every time I want to append some messages?EDIT: little more details. Current implementation utlizes CipherOutputStream. As i understand there's no way to seek using it.Can i use 'NoPadding' option if i will control that output data size is divisible by block size?\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.

The file pointer is then incremented by one. The seek() method of the RandomAccessFile class sets the file-pointer offset, in bytes, from the beginning of this file.\nQuestion: How to convert a string to a byte array in Java?\nPlease using this api: ByteBuffer.wrap.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: ByteBuffer.wrap\n<<<code>>>: String str = \"Hello, World!\";\nbyte[] bytes = str.getBytes();\nByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.wrap(bytes);\n<<<explanation>>>: The wrap() method of the ByteBuffer class is a static factory that allocates a new heap-based ByteBuffer implementation whose content is backed by the given byte array. The position is set to zero, the limit is set to the length of the array, and the mark is set to -1.\nQuestion: How to convert a byte array to a string in Java?\nPlease using this api: new String.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: new String\n<<<code>>>: byte[] bytes = {72, 101, 108, 108, 111};\nString str = new String(bytes);\n<<<explanation>>>: The constructor of the String class that takes a byte array and a charset will create a new String by decoding the byte array using the specified charset.\nQuestion: How to convert a string to a byte array in Java?\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: String.getBytes\n<<<code>>>: String str = \"Hello, World!\";\nbyte[] bytes = str.getBytes();\n<<<explanation>>>: The getBytes() method of the String class returns a sequence of bytes that represent the string. The encoding used is platform dependent.\nQuestion: How to convert a byte array to a string in Java?\nPlease using this api: new String.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: new String\n<<<code>>>: byte[] bytes = {72, 101, 108, 108, 111};\nString str = new String(bytes);\n<<<explanation>>>: The constructor of the String class that takes a byte array and a charset will create a new String by decoding the byte array using the specified charset.\n\n\nA: Here are the answers to your questions:\n\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nAnswer:\n<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.
