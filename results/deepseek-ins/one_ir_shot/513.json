This is a terminal operation. In this case, we are using it to iterate over the entries of the map. For each entry, we print the key as many times as its value.\n\n\nA: Here is how you can calculate the sum of an array using Java 8's Stream API:\n\n```java\nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n```\n\nIn this code, `Arrays.stream(array)` creates a stream of integers from the array. The `sum()` method then calculates the sum of these integers.\n\nAs for your second question, you can create a custom iterator by implementing the Iterator interface in your inner class. Here is a simple example:\n\n```java\nclass CustomIterator implements Iterator<String> {\n    private Iterator<Map.Entry<String, Integer>> iterator;\n    private Map.Entry<String, Integer> currentEntry;\n    private int count;\n\n    public CustomIterator(Map<String, Integer> map) {\n        this.iterator = map.entrySet().iterator();\n        if (iterator.hasNext()) {\n            this.currentEntry = iterator.next();\n            this.count = currentEntry.getValue();\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public boolean hasNext() {\n        return count > 0 || iterator.hasNext();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String next() {\n        if (count == 0) {\n            if (iterator.hasNext()) {\n                this.currentEntry = iterator.next();\n                this.count = currentEntry.getValue();\n            } else {\n                throw new NoSuchElementException();\n            }\n        }\n        count--;\n        return currentEntry.getKey();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, the `CustomIterator` class implements the `Iterator<String>` interface. The `next()` method returns the key of the current entry as many times as its value. The `hasNext()` method returns true if there are more elements to iterate over. The constructor of the `CustomIterator` class takes a `Map<String, Integer>` as a parameter and initializes the iterator and count variables.\n\nYou can use this custom iterator in your code like this:\n\n```java\nMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();\nmap.put(\"hello\", 3);\nmap.put(\"world\", 2);\n\nIterator<String> iterator = new CustomIterator(map);\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\n    System.out.println(iterator.next());\n}\n```\n\nThis will print \"hello\" three times, then \"world\" twice.\n\nThis approach is more efficient than creating an ArrayList and iterating over it, because it avoids the need to store all the elements in memory at once. Instead, it only stores the current entry and the count of repetitions.\n\nPlease note that this is a simple implementation and may not cover all edge cases. You may need to adjust it to fit your specific needs.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>"}
