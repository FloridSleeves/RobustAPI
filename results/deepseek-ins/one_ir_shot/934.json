It is used for message authentication. The keyed-HMAC is a variant of the HMAC that uses a secret key. The key is used to create a hash function that is then used to create the HMAC.\nQuestion: What is the difference between a List and an Array in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: None (this is a conceptual question)\n<<<code>>>: None\n<<<explanation>>>: Arrays in Java are fixed-size and can't be resized. Lists in Java are dynamic and can be resized. Lists in Java can contain duplicate elements, while arrays can't. Lists in Java are backed by an array, which means that they can be used as an array, but they also provide additional methods for manipulating the data.\nQuestion: How can I sort an array in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.sort\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {5, 2, 8, 1, 3};\nArrays.sort(array);\n<<<explanation>>>: The sort() method of the Arrays class sorts the specified array of objects into ascending numerical order. The sort is not stable. The sort is not guaranteed to be in any particular order.\nQuestion: What is the difference between a List and an Array in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: None (this is a conceptual question)\n<<<code>>>: None\n<<<explanation>>>: Arrays in Java are fixed-size and can't be resized.
