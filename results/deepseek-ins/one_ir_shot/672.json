The character to be written is the one that is converted to an int by the method. This is a convenience method that is equivalent to write(c).\nQuestion: How can I read a text file in Java?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"highscores.txt\"));\nString line;\nwhile((line = in.readLine()) != null){\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\nin.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The readLine() method of the BufferedReader class reads a line of text. A line is considered to be terminated by any one of a line feed ('\\n'), a carriage return ('\\r'), or a carriage return followed immediately by a line feed.\nQuestion: How can I check if a file exists in Java?\nPlease using this api: File.exists.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: File.exists\n<<<code>>>: File save = new File(\"highscores.txt\");\nif (!save.exists()){\n    save.createNewFile();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The exists() method of the File class tests whether the file or directory denoted by this abstract pathname exists.\nQuestion: How can I create a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: File.createNewFile.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: File.createNewFile\n<<<code>>>: File save = new File(\"highscores.txt\");\nsave.createNewFile();\n<<<explanation>>>: The createNewFile() method of the File class tries to create a new file denoted by this abstract pathname.\nQuestion: How can I write to a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.println.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.println\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"highscores.txt\", \"UTF-8\");\nwriter.println(\"Hello, World!\");\nwriter.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The println() method of the PrintWriter class prints a line of text followed by a line separator. The line separator string is defined by the system property line.separator, and is not necessarily a single newline ('\\n') character.\nQuestion: How can I read from a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"highscores.txt\"));\nString line;\nwhile((line = in.readLine()) != null){\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\nin.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The readLine() method of the BufferedReader class reads a line of text. A line is considered to be terminated by any one of a line feed ('\\n'), a carriage return ('\\r'), or a carriage return followed immediately by a line feed.\n\n\nA: You can use the File.createNewFile() method to create a new file if it doesn't exist. Here is an example:\nFile save = new File(\"highscores.txt\");\nif (!save.exists()) {\n    try {\n        save.createNewFile();\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    }\n}\n\nThis code will create a new file named \"highscores.txt\" in the same directory as your Java program if it doesn't already exist. If the file already exists, the createNewFile() method will do nothing.\n\nA: You can use the File.exists() method to check if a file exists. If the file does not exist, you can use the File.createNewFile() method to create a new file. Here is an example:\nFile save ="}
