It is a save game file but I can't use java.util.Properties for this (it is under the specification). I have to read the entire file and ignore commented lines and the keys that are not relevant in some classes. These properties are unique but they may be sorted in any order. My file current file looks like this:# BioplayerOrigin=NewlandsplayerClass=Warlock# ArmorplayerHelmet=emptyplayerUpperArmor=armor900playerBottomArmor=armor457playerBoots=boot109etcThese properties are going to be written and placed according to the player's progress and the filereader would have to reach the end of file and get only the matched keys. I've tried different approaches but so far nothing came close to the results that I would had using java.util.Properties.

It returns null if the end of the stream has been reached. This is a terminal operation. The split() method of the String class splits this string around matches of the given regular expression. The trim() method of the String class returns a string whose value is this string, with any leading and trailing whitespace removed.\nQuestion: How to create a simple GUI in Java using Swing:\nPlease using this api: JFrame, JPanel, JButton, JLabel.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: JFrame, JPanel, JButton, JLabel\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nimport javax.swing.*;\nimport java.awt.*;\n\npublic class MyGUI {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        JFrame frame = new JFrame(\"My GUI\");\n        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);\n        frame.setSize(300, 200);\n\n        JPanel panel = new JPanel();\n        panel.setLayout(new FlowLayout());\n\n        JButton button = new JButton(\"Click me\");\n        panel.add(button);\n\n        JLabel label = new JLabel(\"Hello, World!\");\n        panel.add(label);\n\n        frame.getContentPane().add(panel);\n        frame.setVisible(true);\n    }\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: JFrame is the top-level container for a Java Swing GUI.
