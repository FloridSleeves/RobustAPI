This method returns null if there are no more lines to read. The sort() method of the List interface sorts the elements in the list according to their natural ordering. The reverse() method of the Collections class reverses the order of the elements in the list.\nQuestion: How can I sort a list of objects in Java?\nPlease using this api: Collections.sort.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Collections.sort\n<<<code>>>: List<MyObject> list = new ArrayList<>();\nCollections.sort(list, Comparator.comparing(MyObject::getMyProperty));\n<<<explanation>>>: The sort() method of the Collections class sorts the elements in the list according to their natural ordering. The comparing() method of the Comparator class returns a comparator that compares by applying the given function to the elements. This is a special case of a reduction.\nQuestion: How can I sort a list of strings in Java?\nPlease using this api: Collections.sort.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Collections.sort\n<<<code>>>: List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();\nCollections.sort(list);\n<<<explanation>>>: The sort() method of the Collections class sorts the elements in the list according to their natural ordering. The natural ordering of strings is lexicographical order.\nQuestion: How can I sort a list of integers in Java?\nPlease using this api: Collections.sort.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Collections.sort\n<<<code>>>: List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();\nCollections.sort(list);\n<<<explanation>>>: The sort() method of the Collections class sorts the elements in the list according to their natural ordering. The natural ordering of integers is ascending order.\nQuestion: How can I sort a list of custom objects in Java?\nPlease using this api: Collections.sort.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Collections.sort\n<<<code>>>: List<MyCustomObject> list = new ArrayList<>();\nCollections.sort(list, Comparator.comparing(MyCustomObject::getProperty));\n<<<explanation>>>: The sort() method of the Collections class sorts the elements in the list according to their natural ordering. The comparing() method of the Comparator class returns a comparator that compares by applying the given function to the elements. This is a special case of a reduction.\n\n```\n\nPlease note that the code examples provided are in Java.\n\n## AI's answer:\n\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\n\nAnswer:\n\n```java\nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n```\n\nExplanation: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.
