I am trying to make it so that if the enemies are within a certain distance of the ammos, then the enemys remove themselves from the screen. I have attempted to do it and the code compiles, but i am unsure why the enemys arent being removed from the screen once been hit. Can anyone see anything wrong with the code below?

This is a terminal operation. The remove() method of the Iterator interface removes from the underlying collection the last element returned by this iterator. This method can be called only once per call to next().\nQuestion: How can I sort an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.sort.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.sort\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {5, 2, 8, 1, 9};\nArrays.sort(array);\n<<<explanation>>>: The sort() method of the Arrays class sorts the specified array of objects into ascending numerical order. This is a stable sort. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the maximum value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint max = Arrays.stream(array).max().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The max() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalInt describing the maximum element of this stream, or an empty OptionalInt if the stream is empty. This is a short-circuiting terminal operation. The getAsInt() method of the OptionalInt class returns the value, or throws NoSuchElementException if there is no value.\nQuestion: How can I find the minimum value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint min = Arrays.stream(array).min().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The min() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalInt describing the minimum element of this stream, or an empty OptionalInt if the stream is empty. This is a short-circuiting terminal operation. The getAsInt() method of the OptionalInt class returns the value, or throws NoSuchElementException if there is no value.\n\n```\n\n## AI's answer:\n```\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nAnswer: Arrays.stream\nCode: \nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\nExplanation: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\n\nQuestion: Removing from an arraylist android: \nAnswer: Iterator.next\nCode: \nIterator<TopEnemy> iterator = newTopEnemy.iterator();\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\n    TopEnemy enemy = iterator.next();\n    for (int q = 0; q < ammo.length; q++) {\n        float xsubs = enemy.enemyX - ammo[q].positionX;\n        float ysubs = enemy.enemyY - ammo[q].positionY;\n        float squared = (xsubs * xsubs) + (ysubs * ysubs);\n        float distance = (float)Math.sqrt(squared);\n        if (distance < 10.0) {\n            iterator.remove();\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n}\nExplan"}
