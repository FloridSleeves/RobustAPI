It is overloaded to accept a string.\nQuestion: How can I get the file extension of an uploaded file in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: String.split\n<<<code>>>: String fileName = \"example.txt\";\nString[] splitArray = fileName.split(\"\\\\.\");\nString extension = splitArray[splitArray.length-1];\n<<<explanation>>>: The split() method of the String class splits this string around matches of the given regular expression. In this case, we are splitting by the period (.) character. The extension is the last element of the resulting array.\nQuestion: How can I write a file to a directory in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.copy\n<<<code>>>: Path source = Paths.get(\"sourcefile.txt\");\nPath target = Paths.get(\"targetdir/targetfile.txt\");\nFiles.copy(source, target, StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING);\n<<<explanation>>>: The copy() method of the Files class copies the content of the source file to the target file. The REPLACE_EXISTING option replaces the existing file if it exists.\nQuestion: How can I handle a file upload in Java using commons file upload streaming API?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileItemFactory, FileItemIterator\n<<<code>>>: FileItemFactory factory = new DiskFileItemFactory();\nFileItemIterator iterator = factory.createItemIterator(request, \"upload\");\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\n    FileItem item = iterator.next();\n    if (!item.isFormField()) {\n        String fileName = item.getName();\n        String fileExtension = fileName.substring(fileName.lastIndexOf(\".\"));\n        File uploadedFile = new File(\"uploads/\" + fileName);\n        item.write(uploadedFile);\n    }\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The createItemIterator() method of the FileItemFactory class creates an iterator that iterates over the items in the multipart request. The isFormField() method of the FileItem class checks if the item is a form field or a file. The getName() method of the FileItem class gets the name of the file. The substring() method of the String class is used to get the file extension. The write() method of the FileItem class writes the content of the file to the specified file.\n\nPlease note that the code examples provided are simplified and may not cover all edge cases. Always validate and sanitize user input when handling file uploads to prevent security vulnerabilities.\n\nAlso, remember to handle exceptions that may occur during file operations.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>"}
