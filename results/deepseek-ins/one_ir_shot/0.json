The setContentView() method must be called before findViewById() because it sets the layout for the activity.\nIn your MainActivity, you should call setContentView(R.layout.activity_main) before calling helper.setupDatePicker().\nHere's how your onCreate() method should look:\nprotected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n    requestWindowFeature(Window.FEATURE_NO_TITLE);\n    getWindow().setFlags(WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_FULLSCREEN, WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_FULLSCREEN);\n    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main); // Set the layout for the activity\n    AlarmHelper helper = new AlarmHelper();\n    helper.setupDatePicker();\n}\n\nAlso, you should consider extending ListActivity instead of Activity if you're going to use a ListView. This will give you a ListView that you can easily access with getListView().\n\nA: The NullPointerException is because you are trying to call findViewById() before setContentView().
