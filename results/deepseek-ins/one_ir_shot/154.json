Each row in the table is represented by an instance of the specified type parameter. This is a non-terminal operation.\n\n\nA: \nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\n\nYou can use the Arrays.stream API in Java 8 and later. Here is an example:\n\n```java\nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n```\n\nIn this example, `Arrays.stream(array)` creates a stream of integers from the array, and `sum()` calculates the sum of these integers.\n\n\nQuestion: Socket Server with multiple client in java: :I have to create a socket server which will listen to multiple client. Suppose there are 6 clients connected to the server at the same time and each of the clients are sending some commands to server at the same time. If these clients sending the message to server for every 1 second how can I handle the those messages from the 6 clients on the server side to store it in the table and the acknowledgement to each client. How can i handle these input from from the client. Whether I have to create 6 threads to handle these inputs from the client. Please give me a idea to approach this issue.\n\nYou can handle multiple client connections by creating a separate thread for each client. This way, you can handle each client's input and output independently. Here's a basic example of how you can do this:\n\n```java\nServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(port);\nwhile (true) {\n    Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();\n    new Thread(new ClientHandler(clientSocket)).start();\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `serverSocket.accept()` waits for a client to connect to the server. When a client connects, a new `ClientHandler` thread is created and started. The `ClientHandler` class should implement `Runnable` and handle the client's input and output.\n\nFor handling the messages from the clients, you can use `InputStream.read()` to read the messages from the client's input stream. You can store these messages in a table and send an acknowledgement to the client using `OutputStream.write()`.\n\nWhether you need to create a separate thread for each client depends on your specific requirements. If you have a large number of clients, you might want to consider using a thread pool to limit the number of threads that are active at once.\n\n\nQuestion: How can I create a table in JavaFX?\n\nYou can create a table in JavaFX using the `TableView` class. Here's an example:\n\n```java\nTableView<Person> table = new TableView<>();\nTableColumn<Person, String> firstNameCol = new TableColumn<>(\"First Name\");\nfirstNameCol.setCellValueFactory(new PropertyValueFactory<>(\"firstName\"));\ntable.getColumns().addAll(firstNameCol, lastNameCol, emailCol);\n```\n\nIn this example, `new TableView<>()` creates a new table view. `TableColumn` objects are used to define the columns of the table, and `setCellValueFactory()` is used to specify how to get the data for each cell in the column"}
