This is a intermediate operation.\n\n\nA: Here is how you can calculate the sum of an array using Java 8's Stream API:\n\n```java\nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n```\n\nThis code creates a stream of integers from the array, then uses the sum() method to calculate the sum.\n\nFor your second question, you can use the Iterator to iterate over the list of strings and process each string. Here is an example:\n\n```java\nList<String> list = Arrays.asList(\"dbcebcdeddacbebcdacedbcda\".split(\"\"));\nIterator<String> iterator = list.iterator();\nwhile(iterator.hasNext()) {\n    String s = iterator.next();\n    // process s\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, the iterator goes through each string in the list and you can perform any operation you want on each string.\n\nFor your third question, you can use the flatMap method of the Stream API to flatten the 2D array into a single stream, then use the max() method to find the maximum value:\n\n```java\nint[][] array = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}};\nint max = Arrays.stream(array).flatMapToInt(Arrays::stream).max().getAsInt();\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can use the min() method to find the minimum value in the 2D array:\n\n```java\nint min = Arrays.stream(array).flatMapToInt(Arrays::stream).min().getAsInt();\n```\n\nThese codes create a stream of integers from the 2D array, then use the max() and min() methods to find the maximum and minimum values.\n\nPlease note that these codes assume that the 2D array is a square matrix. If it's not, you might need to adjust the code to handle the non-square case.\n\nAlso, these codes use Java 8's Stream API, which is available if you're using Java 8 or later. If you're using an older version of Java, you might need to use a different approach.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>"}
