The bytes are encoded in the platform's default charset. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: What is the difference between the two methods of writing to a file in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileOutputStream\n<<<code>>>: FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(\"file.txt\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The FileOutputStream class is a subclass of OutputStream and is used for writing data to a file. It is part of the Java I/O package.\nQuestion: How can I read a file in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileInputStream\n<<<code>>>: FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(\"file.txt\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The FileInputStream class is a subclass of InputStream and is used for reading data from a file. It is part of the Java I/O package.\nQuestion: How can I write to a file in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileOutputStream\n<<<code>>>: FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(\"file.txt\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The FileOutputStream class is a subclass of OutputStream and is used for writing data to a file. It is part of the Java I/O package.\nQuestion: How can I read a file line by line in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"file.txt\"));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The BufferedReader class is a subclass of Reader and is used for reading text from a character-input stream. It buffers characters so as to provide for the efficient reading of characters, arrays, and lines. It is part of the Java I/O package. The readLine() method reads a line of text. It returns null if the end of the stream has been reached.\nQuestion: How can I write to a file line by line in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedWriter\n<<<code>>>: BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(\"file.txt\"));\nbw.write(\"Line 1\");\nbw.newLine();\nbw.write(\"Line 2\");\nbw.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The BufferedWriter class is a subclass of Writer and is used for writing text to a character-output stream. It buffers characters so as to provide for the efficient writing of single characters, arrays, and strings. It is part of the Java I/O package. The newLine() method writes the line separator.\nQuestion: How can I read a file in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileInputStream\n<<<code>>>: FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(\"file.txt\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The FileInputStream class is a subclass of InputStream and is used for reading data from a file.
