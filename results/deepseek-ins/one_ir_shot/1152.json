This method continues to search for tokens from the beginning of the string.\nQuestion: How to use the Java 8 Stream API to filter out the words with a specific tag from a list of words?:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Stream.filter\n<<<code>>>: \nList<String> words = Arrays.asList(\"mike-NNS\", \"buses-NNP\", \"walk_VRB\", \"to_PRP\", \"and\", \"so\", \"on\");\nList<String> filteredWords = words.stream()\n    .filter(word -> !word.endsWith(\"_PRP\"))\n    .collect(Collectors.toList());\n<<<explanation>>>: The filter() method of the Stream interface returns a stream consisting of the elements of this stream that match the given predicate. This is a intermediate operation.\nQuestion: How to use Java 8 Stream API to find the sum of the elements in a list of integers?:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Stream.mapToInt\n<<<code>>>: \nList<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);\nint sum = numbers.stream().mapToInt(Integer::intValue).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The mapToInt() method of the Stream interface returns an IntStream consisting of the results of applying the given function to the elements of this stream. This is a intermediate operation. The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to use Java 8 Stream API to find the average of the elements in a list of integers?:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Stream.mapToInt\n<<<code>>>: \nList<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);\nOptionalDouble average = numbers.stream().mapToInt(Integer::intValue).average();\n<<<explanation>>>: The mapToInt() method of the Stream interface returns an IntStream consisting of the results of applying the given function to the elements of this stream. This is a intermediate operation. The average() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalDouble that represents the average of the elements in this stream. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to use Java 8 Stream API to find the maximum element in a list of integers?:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Stream.mapToInt\n<<<code>>>: \nList<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);\nOptionalInt max = numbers.stream().mapToInt(Integer::intValue).max();\n<<<explanation>>>: The mapToInt() method of the Stream interface returns an IntStream consisting of the results of applying the given function to the elements of this stream. This is a intermediate operation. The max() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalInt that represents the maximum element of this stream. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to use Java 8 Stream API to find the minimum element in a list of integers?:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Stream.mapToInt\n<<<code>>>: \nList<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);\nOptionalInt min = numbers.stream().mapToInt(Integer::intValue).min();\n<<<explanation>>>: The mapToInt() method of the Stream interface returns an IntStream consisting of the results of applying the given function to the elements of this stream. This is a intermediate operation. The min() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalInt that represents the minimum element of this stream. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to use Java 8 Stream API to find the count of elements in a list of integers?:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>:"}
