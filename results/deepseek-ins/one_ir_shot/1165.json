In Java, arrays are not assignable, they are objects. You can assign an array to a variable, but you can't assign a value to an array element.\nHere's how you can do it:\npublic double parseEqn(String str) {\n    StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(str,\"+-/*%\",true);\n    String first = st.nextToken();\n    String op = st.nextToken();\n    String second = st.nextToken();\n    double ff = Double.parseDouble(first);\n    double ss = Double.parseDouble(second);\n    double answer = 0.0;\n    if (op.equals(\"+\")){\n        answer= ff+ss;\n    } else if (op.equals(\"-\")){\n        answer= ff-ss;\n    } else if (op.equals(\"/\")){\n        answer= ff/ss;\n    } else if (op.equals(\"*\")){\n        answer= ff*ss;\n    }\n    return answer;\n}\n\nThis code will work as you expect. It tokenizes the input string, converts the first and second tokens to doubles, and then performs the operation indicated by the operator token.\n\nA: The error you're seeing is because you're trying to assign a value to an array in Java.
