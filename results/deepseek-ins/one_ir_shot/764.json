The character to be written is given as an integer. This is a convenience method that converts the integer to a character before writing it.\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The readLine() method of the BufferedReader class reads a line of text from the input stream and returns it as a String. It returns null if the end of the stream has been reached.\nQuestion: How to write a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.println.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.println\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(file);\npw.println(\"Hello, World!\");\npw.flush();\n<<<explanation>>>: The println() method of the PrintWriter class writes a line of text to the output stream.
