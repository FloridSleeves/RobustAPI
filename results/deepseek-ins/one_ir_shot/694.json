The write(String s) method of PrintWriter class is used to write a string to the output stream. The second argument \"UTF-8\" is used to specify the character encoding.\n\nA: Here is how you can calculate the sum of an array in Java using Arrays.stream:\n\n<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\n\nThe sum of the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is 15.\n\nRegarding your question about the encoding of the output file, it seems like you have already set the encoding to UTF-8 in your Eclipse settings. However, if you are still seeing characters encoded in a different way, it could be due to a number of factors. \n\nHere are a few things you could check:\n\n1. Make sure your source code file is saved in UTF-8 encoding. You can check this in Eclipse by right-clicking on your file and selecting \"Properties\", then going to the \"Text file encoding\" tab.\n\n2. Make sure your output file is being written in UTF-8 encoding. You can check this by opening the file in a text editor and checking the encoding.\n\n3. Make sure your system's default encoding is set to UTF-8. You can check this by running the command `System.getProperty(\"file.encoding\")` in your Java program.\n\n4. If you are writing to a file, make sure you are using the correct encoding when opening the file. For example, in Java, you can specify the encoding when opening a file with `new FileOutputStream(filename, false)`.\n\nIf you are still having issues, it would be helpful to know more about your specific situation. For example, what operating system are you using, and how are you running your program?\n\nAs for your question about running the executable .jar file outside of the command line, it depends on the operating system. \n\nOn Windows, you can typically double-click the .jar file to run it. On Mac, you can drag the .jar file to the Applications folder to create a shortcut. On Linux, you can extract the .jar file and run it from the command line with `java -jar filename.jar`.\n\nIf you are having trouble running the .jar file, it might be due to a problem with the Java runtime environment on your system. You can download and install the latest version of Java from the official website.\n\nAs for the BufferedWriter issue, you are on the right track. You are correctly specifying the character encoding when creating the BufferedWriter. Here is an example:\n\n```java\nBufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(new FileOutputStream(filename), \"UTF-8\"));\nbw.write(\"Hello, World!\");\nbw.close();\n```\n\nThis should ensure that your output file is encoded correctly in UTF-8.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n"}
