I am given an iterator for a list of integers. I need to write a function that returns takes this iterator as argument and returns the iterator for even numbers only. I was told, I cannot modify the original list of numbers. Hence, removing odd numbers from the list is not the solution. Please advise.

This method may be called repeatedly to get the next element in the iteration. If there are no more elements in the iteration, a NoSuchElementException is thrown.\nQuestion: What is the difference between the '==' operator and the 'equals()' method in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: '==' operator and 'equals()' method\n<<<code>>>: \nint a = 10;\nint b = 10;\nString s1 = new String(\"Hello\");\nString s2 = new String(\"Hello\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The '==' operator is used to compare primitive data types and references. It checks if both the objects point to the same memory location or not. On the other hand, the 'equals()' method is used to compare complex data types like String, Arrays etc. It checks if the actual content of the objects is same or not.\nQuestion: What is the difference between '==' and '===' in JavaScript?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: '==' and '===' in JavaScript\n<<<code>>>: \nvar a = 10;\nvar b = \"10\";\nvar c = [10];\n<<<explanation>>>: The '==' operator in JavaScript is used for loose equality, which means it converts the operands to the same type before making the comparison. The '===' operator is known as strict equality, which means it does not perform type conversion and returns true only if both operands are of the same type and equal value.\nQuestion: What is the difference between '==' and '===' in Python?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: '==' and '===' in Python\n<<<code>>>: \na = 10\nb = \"10\"\nc = [10]\n<<<explanation>>>: The '==' operator in Python is used for equality comparison, which means it checks if the values of two operands are equal or not. The '===' operator does not exist in Python. Python uses '==' and 'is' for equality and identity comparison respectively.\nQuestion: What is the difference between '==' and '===' in C#?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: '==' and '===' in C#\n<<<code>>>: \nint a = 10;\nstring b = \"10\";\nList<int> c = new List<int> { 10 };\n<<<explanation>>>: The '==' operator in C# is used for equality comparison, which means it checks if the values of two operands are equal or not. The '===' operator does not exist in C#. C# uses '==' and 'is' for equality and identity comparison respectively.\n\n```\n\n## AI's answer\n```\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.
