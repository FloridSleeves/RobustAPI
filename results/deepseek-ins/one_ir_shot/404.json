Calling this method on an iterator that has passed the last element of the collection will throw a NoSuchElementException.\n\n\nA: The conventional iterator interface in Java does not separate traversal from element access. The Iterator interface provides a next() method to get the next element in the iteration and an hasNext() method to check if there is a next element. These methods are used to traverse the collection and access the elements.\n\nIf you want to move the pointer around without returning an element, you can use a ListIterator. The ListIterator interface extends the Iterator interface and provides additional operations to retrieve, insert, and remove elements from a list.\n\nHere is an example of using a ListIterator:\n\n```java\nList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();\n// populate the list\n\nListIterator<String> iterator = list.listIterator();\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\n    iterator.next(); // Move the pointer\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the ListIterator.next() method is used to move the pointer to the next element in the list. The ListIterator.hasNext() method is used to check if there is a next element in the list.\n\nPlease note that the ListIterator also provides methods to move the pointer backwards (previous()) and to insert and remove elements (add(), remove(), set()). If you don't need these operations, you can use the Iterator interface.\n\nIn conclusion, if you want to move the pointer around without returning an element, you can use the ListIterator interface.\n\nA: You can use Java 8's Stream API to calculate the sum of an array. Here is an example:\n\n```java\nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n```\n\nIn this example, the `Arrays.stream(array)` method is used to create a stream from the array. The `sum()` method is then called on the stream to calculate the sum of the elements in the array.\n\nAs for your second question, Java does not have a built-in interface that separates traversal from element access like you described. However, you can use a ListIterator to achieve this. Here is an example:\n\n```java\nList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();\n// populate the list\n\nListIterator<String> iterator = list.listIterator();\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\n    iterator.next(); // Move the pointer\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `ListIterator.next()` method is used to move the pointer to the next element in the list. The `ListIterator.hasNext()` method is used to check if there is a next element in the list.\n\nPlease note that the ListIterator also provides methods to move the pointer backwards (previous()) and to insert and remove elements (add(), remove(), set()).
