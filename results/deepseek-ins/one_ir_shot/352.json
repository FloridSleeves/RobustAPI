The current iterator is determined by the variable currentIterator. When hasNext() is called, it checks if the current iterator has a next element. If it does not, it increments currentIterator until it finds an iterator with a next element or until it has checked all iterators. The next() method simply returns the next element of the current iterator. The remove() method removes the last element returned by next() from the current iterator.\nQuestion: How to create a custom comparator in Java?\nPlease using this api: Comparator.comparing.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Comparator.comparing\n<<<code>>>: \nComparator<Person> comparator = Comparator.comparing(Person::getAge);\nList<Person> people = Arrays.asList(\n    new Person(\"Sara\", 20),\n    new Person(\"Mark\", 30),\n    new Person(\"Bob\", 40));\n\npeople.sort(comparator);\n\npublic class Person {\n    private String name;\n    private int age;\n\n    public Person(String name, int age) {\n        this.name = name;\n        this.age = age;\n    }\n\n    public String getName() {\n        return name;\n    }\n\n    public int getAge() {\n        return age;\n    }\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The Comparator.comparing() method takes a function that extracts a Comparable key from the object being compared, and returns a Comparator that compares according to the natural ordering of that key. In this case, it's comparing the age of the Person objects. The sort() method uses this comparator to sort the list of Person objects by age.\n\n```\n\n## 2022-03-11\n\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nAnswer: You can use the Arrays.stream API in Java 8 and later. Here is an example:\n\n```java\nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n```\n\nExplanation: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\n\nQuestion: How to join multiple iterators in Java?\nAnswer: You can create a new Iterator that cycles through the elements of the iterators in the list.
