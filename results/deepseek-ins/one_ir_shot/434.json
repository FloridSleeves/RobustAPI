I have initialized the hashmap with keys from 0-51 and the values are array of Card, as followsCard [] card = new Card[52]for (int i=1; i<=13; i++)    for (int j=0; j<4; j++)        card[++index] = new Card( ((i*10)+j) );and I populate the hashmap as follows:for (int i=1; i<=13; i++)    for (int j=0; j<4; j++)        deck.put( ++key, card[++index] );Now, what I want to do is to shuffle the values side of the hashmap, i do not want,for an example, the key[1] corresponds to card[0] and key[1] corresponds to card[1]. I want, for an exampel, the key[1] corresponds to card[38]. I want the values side to be shuffled.

In your case, you want to shuffle the values of the hashmap, so you should pass the values() method of the hashmap to the shuffle method.\n\nNote: The shuffle method works on a List, not a Collection. So you can convert the Collection to a List using the stream API:\n\n<<<code>>>: List<Card> cardList = deck.values().stream().collect(Collectors.toList());\nCollections.shuffle(cardList);\n<<<explanation>>>: The stream() method of the Collection interface returns a sequential Stream with this collection as its source. The collect() method of the Stream interface performs a mutable reduction operation on the elements of this stream. In this case, we use Collectors.toList() to collect the elements of the stream into a List.\n\nThis way, you can shuffle the values of the hashmap.\n\nA: Here is how you can calculate the sum of an array in Java using Arrays.stream:\n\n```java\nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n```\n\nIn this code, `Arrays.stream(array)` creates a stream of integers from the array. The `sum()` method then calculates the sum of these integers.\n\nAs for shuffling a deck of cards using a HashMap, you can use the `Collections.shuffle` method with the values of the HashMap as follows:\n\n```java\nHashMap<Integer, Card> deck = new HashMap<>();\n// Initialize the deck...\n\nList<Card> cardList = new ArrayList<>(deck.values());\nCollections.shuffle(cardList);\n```\n\nIn this code, `new ArrayList<>(deck.values())` creates a list of the Card objects from the HashMap. The `Collections.shuffle` method then shuffles this list.\n\nPlease note that the `Collections.shuffle` method works with Lists, not Collections. Therefore, you need to convert the Collection to a List before using it with `Collections.shuffle`.\n\nAlso, please note that the `Collections.shuffle` method shuffles the list in-place, meaning that the original order of the list is lost. If you need to keep the original order of the list, you should create a copy of it before shuffling.\n\nI hope this helps clarify how to use the `Arrays.stream` and `Collections.shuffle` methods in Java.\n\n\nA: Here is how you can calculate the sum of an array in Java using Arrays.stream:\n\n```java\nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint"}
