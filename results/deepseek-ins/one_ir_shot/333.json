This is the number of cells in the row, not counting any cells that are merged into this one.\nQuestion: How to get the value of a cell in a specific row and column in a specific sheet in an Excel file using Apache POI:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Cell.getCell(int columnIndex, int rowIndex)\n<<<code>>>: \nWorkbook workbook = WorkbookFactory.create(new File(\"ExcelFile.xlsx\"));\nSheet sheet = workbook.getSheetAt(0);\nCell cell = sheet.getRow(1).getCell(2);\nString cellValue = cell.getStringCellValue();\n<<<explanation>>>: The getCell(int columnIndex, int rowIndex) method of the Sheet class returns the cell at the specified position in this sheet. The cell is created if it does not exist. The row and column indices are zero-based.\nQuestion: How to read a specific cell value from an Excel file using Apache POI:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Cell.getStringCellValue()\n<<<code>>>: \nWorkbook workbook = WorkbookFactory.create(new File(\"ExcelFile.xlsx\"));\nSheet sheet = workbook.getSheetAt(0);\nCell cell = sheet.getRow(1).getCell(2);\nString cellValue = cell.getStringCellValue();\n<<<explanation>>>: The getStringCellValue() method of the Cell class returns the cell's value as a String. If the cell is not a string cell, the method will throw an exception.\nQuestion: How to read all the values from a specific column in an Excel file using Apache POI:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Sheet.getRow(int rowNum).getCell(int columnIndex)\n<<<code>>>: \nWorkbook workbook = WorkbookFactory.create(new File(\"ExcelFile.xlsx\"));\nSheet sheet = workbook.getSheetAt(0);\nint lastRowNum = sheet.getLastRowNum();\nfor (int i = 0; i <= lastRowNum; i++) {\n    Row row = sheet.getRow(i);\n    Cell cell = row.getCell(2); // column index is 2\n    String cellValue = cell.getStringCellValue();\n    System.out.println(cellValue);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The getRow(int rowNum) method of the Sheet class returns the row at the given zero-based row index. The row is created if it does not exist. The getCell(int columnIndex) method of the Row class returns the cell at the specified position in this row. The cell is created if it does not exist. The row and column indices are zero-based.\nQuestion: How to read all the values from a specific row in an Excel file using Apache POI:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Row.getCell(int columnIndex)\n<<<code>>>: \nWorkbook workbook = WorkbookFactory.create(new File(\"ExcelFile.xlsx\"));\nSheet sheet = workbook.getSheetAt(0);\nRow row = sheet.getRow(1); // row index is 1\nint lastCellNum = row.getLastCellNum();\nfor (int i = 0; i < lastCellNum; i++) {\n    Cell cell = row.getCell(i);\n    String cellValue = cell.getStringCellValue();\n    System.out.println(cellValue);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The getCell(int columnIndex) method of the Row class returns the cell at the specified position in this row. The cell is created if it does not exist. The column index is zero-based. The getLastCellNum() method of the Row class returns the index of the last cell in this row, considering that cells may be sparse.\nQuestion: How to read all the values from an Excel file using Apache POI:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Sheet.getRow(int rowNum).getCell(int columnIndex)\n<<<code>>>: \nWork"}
