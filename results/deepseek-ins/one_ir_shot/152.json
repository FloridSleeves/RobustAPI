Please advice on this. \nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: InputStream in = new FileInputStream(file);\nbyte[] buffer1 = new byte[1024];\nbyte[] buffer2 = new byte[1024];\nint bytesRead1 = in.read(buffer1);\nint bytesRead2 = in.read(buffer2);\n<<<explanation>>>: The read() method of the InputStream class reads some number of bytes from the input stream and stores them into the buffer array b. The number of bytes read is returned. If the end of the stream is reached, -1 is returned.
