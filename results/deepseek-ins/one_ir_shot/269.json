So Im stuck :(Any suggestions? thanks a lot!\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.

In this case, it returns the next Map<String, String> from the collection. Then, we use the get(Object key) method of the Map interface to get the value of the specific column.\nQuestion: How can I sort a list of integers in descending order in Java?\nPlease using this api: Collections.sort.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Collections.sort\n<<<code>>>: List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(5, 2, 10, 3, 1);\nCollections.sort(list, Collections.reverseOrder());\n<<<explanation>>>: The sort() method of the Collections class sorts the elements in the specified list into ascending order. If we want to sort in descending order, we can use the reverseOrder() method of the Collections class as a comparator.\n\n\nA: Question: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nAnswer:\n<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.
