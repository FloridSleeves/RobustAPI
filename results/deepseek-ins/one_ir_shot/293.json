The foreach loop in Java is designed to iterate over a collection or an array without the need to know the index of the current element. It's used to process each item in a collection or array.\n\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Python?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: sum\n<<<code>>>: array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nsum = sum(array)\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() function returns the sum of all elements in an iterable.\n\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in JavaScript?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: reduce\n<<<code>>>: let array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nlet sum = array.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);\n<<<explanation>>>: The reduce() method executes a reducer function (that you provide) on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value.
