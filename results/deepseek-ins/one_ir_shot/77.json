The number of bytes read is returned.\n\n\nA: Here is how you can write and read multiple byte[] in a file with Java:\n\n1. Writing multiple byte[] to a file:\n\n```java\nDataOutputStream out = new DataOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(\"file.txt\"));\n\nbyte[] byteArray1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nbyte[] byteArray2 = {6, 7, 8, 9, 10};\n\nout.write(byteArray1);\nout.write(byteArray2);\n\nout.close();\n```\n\n2. Reading multiple byte[] from a file:\n\n```java\nDataInputStream in = new DataInputStream(new FileInputStream(\"file.txt\"));\n\nbyte[] byteArray1 = new byte[5];\nbyte[] byteArray2 = new byte[5];\n\nin.readFully(byteArray1);\nin.readFully(byteArray2);\n\nin.close();\n```\n\nIn this example, we are writing two byte arrays to a file. After that, we are reading them back. The `readFully` method will throw an `EOFException` if the"}
