If the argument is null, then the string \"null\" is printed. The println() method behaves as print() but always prints a line terminator. In your case, you want to print the number and then terminate the line, so you should use print() instead of println().\nQuestion: How to get the current date and time in Java?\nPlease using this api: java.time.LocalDateTime.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: java.time.LocalDateTime\n<<<code>>>: LocalDateTime now = LocalDateTime.now();\n<<<explanation>>>: The now() method of the LocalDateTime class returns the current date and time. The returned value is expressed in the system's current time-zone.\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: java.nio.file.Files.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: java.nio.file.Files\n<<<code>>>: Path path = Paths.get(\"file.txt\");\nbyte[] data = Files.readAllBytes(path);\n<<<explanation>>>: The readAllBytes() method of the Files class returns the contents of the file as a byte array. The file is opened and read in one operation. The file is not closed until all bytes are read.\nQuestion: How to write to a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: java.nio.file.Files.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: java.nio.file.Files\n<<<code>>>: Path path = Paths.get(\"file.txt\");\nFiles.write(path, \"Hello, World!\".getBytes());\n<<<explanation>>>: The write() method of the Files class writes the specified byte array to the file. If the file does not exist, it is created. If it does exist, it is truncated to zero size.\nQuestion: How to create a directory in Java?\nPlease using this api: java.nio.file.Files.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: java.nio.file.Files\n<<<code>>>: Path path = Paths.get(\"directory\");\nFiles.createDirectories(path);\n<<<explanation>>>: The createDirectories() method of the Files class creates a directory and its parents if they do not already exist. If the directory already exists, it is not modified by this method.\nQuestion: How to list files in a directory in Java?\nPlease using this api: java.nio.file.Files.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: java.nio.file.Files\n<<<code>>>: Path path = Paths.get(\"directory\");\nFiles.list(path).forEach(System.out::println);\n<<<explanation>>>: The list() method of the Files class returns a stream of file names (Paths) for the files in the directory. The stream is ordered, directory order is not guaranteed.\nQuestion: How to delete a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: java.nio.file.Files.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: java.nio.file.Files\n<<<code>>>: Path path = Paths.get(\"file.txt\");\nFiles.delete(path);\n<<<explanation>>>: The delete() method of the Files class deletes the file denoted by this path. If the file does not exist, then the method does nothing and the method returns false.\nQuestion: How to rename a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: java.nio.file.Files.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: java.nio.file.Files\n<<<code>>>: Path oldPath = Paths.get(\"old.txt\");\nPath newPath = Paths.get(\"new.txt\");\nFiles.move(oldPath, newPath);\n<<<explanation>>>: The move() method of the Files class moves the file denoted by this path to the file denoted by the target path. If the target path is a directory, then the file is moved to the directory. If the target path is a file, then the file is replaced by the moved file.\nQuestion: How to check if a file exists in Java?\nPlease using this api: java.nio.file.Files.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: java.nio"}
