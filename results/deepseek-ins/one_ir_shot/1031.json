The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\n\nQuestion: How to change Stringtokenizer to String: \nAnswer: The nextToken() method of the StringTokenizer class returns the next token from the string. This method will throw a NoSuchElementException if there are no more tokens in the string. You can then convert the returned string to an integer using Integer.parseInt().\n\nQuestion: How to create a new thread in Java?\nAnswer: The start() method of the Thread class starts a new thread of execution. The new thread is added to the scheduler and starts executing. The start() method is called on the new thread object.\n\nQuestion: How to create a new thread in Java using lambda expressions?\nAnswer: Lambda expressions allow you to represent a function as an object, which can be passed around and invoked later.
