'equals()' is a method in Java, which checks if the two objects are equal. In the case of String objects, 'equals()' checks if the two strings are equal in terms of their content, while '==' checks if they are the same object.\nQuestion: What is the difference between '==' and 'equals()' in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: '==' and 'equals()'\n<<<code>>>: \n```\nString str1 = new String(\"java\");\nString str2 = new String(\"java\");\nString str3 = \"java\";\nSystem.out.println(str1 == str2); // false\nSystem.out.println(str1 == str3); // false\nSystem.out.println(str1.equals(str2)); // true\nSystem.out.println(str1.equals(str3)); // true\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: '==' is a comparison operator in Java, which checks if the two references point to the same location.
