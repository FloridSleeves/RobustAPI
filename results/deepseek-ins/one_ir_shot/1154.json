The newLine() method of the BufferedWriter class writes a line separator.\n\n\nA: The problem is in your while loop. You are closing the BufferedWriter in each iteration, which means that you are opening and closing the file in each iteration. You should close the BufferedWriter after the while loop, not inside it. Here is the corrected code:\ntry {\n    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"C:/Users/madhan kumar/Desktop/read.txt\"));\n    BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(\"out.txt\"));\n    String line;\n    while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n        String[] result = line.split(\"\\\\|\");\n        String Name = result[0];\n        String age = result[1];\n        String Sex = result[2];\n        String field = result[3];\n        System.out.println(\"Name :\" + Name + \" Age :\" + age + \" Sex :\" + Sex + \" Field :\" + field);\n        bw.write(\"Name :\" + Name + \" Age :\" + age + \" Sex :\" + Sex + \" Field :\" + field);\n        bw.newLine();\n    }\n    br.close();\n    bw.close();\n} catch (Exception e) {\n    System.out.println(e);\n}\n\nThis code will read each line from the input file, split it into fields, print the fields, and write the fields to the output file. The BufferedWriter is closed after all lines have been processed.\n\n"}
