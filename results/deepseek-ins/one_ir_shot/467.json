Thanks.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: Iterator<Integer> iterator = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5).iterator();\nint sum = 0;\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\n    sum += iterator.next();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The next() method of the Iterator interface returns the next element in the iteration. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java using recursion?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Recursion\n<<<code>>>: public int summation(int[] array, int n) {\n    return (n == 0)\n        ? array[0]\n        : array[n] + summation(array, n - 1);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: Recursion is a method of solving problems where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. In this case, the sum of an array is calculated by adding the last element of the array to the sum of the rest of the array. The base case is when there is only one element in the array, in which case the sum is just that element.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java using a for-each loop?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: for-each loop\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = 0;\nfor (int number : array) {\n    sum += number;\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The for-each loop is used to iterate over elements in an array or other iterable object. In this case, it is used to iterate over each element in the array and add it to the sum.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java using a while loop?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: while loop\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = 0;\nint i = 0;\nwhile (i < array.length) {\n    sum += array[i];\n    i++;\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The while loop is used to iterate over elements in an array. In this case, it is used to iterate over each element in the array and add it to the sum. The condition for the loop to continue is that the index i is less than the length of the array.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java using a do-while loop?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: do-while loop\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = 0;\nint i = 0;\ndo {\n    sum += array[i];\n    i++;\n} while (i < array.length);\n<<<explanation>>>: The do-while loop is used to iterate over elements in an array. In this case, it is used to iterate over each element in the array and add it to the sum. The condition for the loop to continue is that the index i is less than the length of the array. The difference between a while loop and a do-while loop is that a do-while loop always executes its body at least once, regardless of the condition.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java using a for loop?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: for loop\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = 0;\nfor (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    sum += array[i];\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The for loop is used to iterate over elements in an array. In this case, it is used to iterate over each element in the array and add it to the sum. The condition for the loop to continue is that the index i is less than the length of the array.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java using a for loop with a step of 2?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: for loop with a step of 2\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = 0;\nfor (int i = 0; i < array."}
