The examples I've found on the web are all using a per line cycle, e.g.:while(readline)  result = parse(line)  doStuff(result)But what if I'm writing something like pascal/smtp/etc, with a \"first line\" looks like X requirment? I know it can be checked in doStuff, but I think logically it is part of the syntax.Or what if a command is split into multiple lines? I can trywhile(readline)  lines.add(line)  try    result = parse(lines)    lines = []    doStuff(result)  catch    nopBut with this I'm also hiding real errors.Or I could reparse all lines everytime, but:it will be slow there are instructions I don't want to run twiceCan this be done with ANTLR, or if not, with something else?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.

If no byte is available, it blocks until one is available. The value byte is returned as an int in the range 0 to 255.\nQuestion: How to create a simple REST API in Java using Spring Boot?\nPlease using this api: Spring Boot.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Spring Boot\n<<<code>>>:\n@RestController\npublic class HelloController {\n    @GetMapping(\"/hello\")\n    public String hello() {\n        return \"Hello, World!\";\n    }\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The @RestController annotation is used to define a controller. The @GetMapping annotation is used to map a specific HTTP GET request onto a specific method. In this case, when a GET request is made to the \"/hello\" endpoint, the hello() method will be called.\nQuestion: How to create a simple GUI in Java using Swing?\nPlease using this api: Swing.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Swing\n<<<code>>>:\nimport javax.swing.*;\n\npublic class HelloWorldSwing {\n    private static void createAndShowGUI() {\n        JFrame frame = new JFrame(\"HelloWorldSwing\");\n        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);\n\n        JLabel label = new JLabel(\"Hello World\");\n        frame.getContentPane().add(label);\n\n        frame.pack();\n        frame.setVisible(true);\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        javax.swing.SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable() {\n            public void run() {\n                createAndShowGUI();\n            }\n        });\n    }\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: Swing is a set of java libraries for creating graphical user interfaces. The javax.swing package contains classes for creating GUI components, such as JFrame (a top-level container), JLabel (a label), and JButton (a button). The SwingUtilities.invokeLater method is used to run the createAndShowGUI method on the Event Dispatch Thread (EDT), which is necessary for Swing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
