I know that if i traverse the list to find a certain node it would take O(n) time so I want to map the nodes to an array list where I can access the nodes in O(1) time.I'm really unsure how I would do this mapping. I would like to see an example of how this can be done.Edit:I would like to be able to access any node in the linked list so I can move the nodes around in O(1) time.Example: Move node with ID 5 to end of list in O(1) time.
