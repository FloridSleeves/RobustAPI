If there are no more tokens, it will throw an exception.\nQuestion: How can I create a new array with the elements of another array in reverse order?\nPlease using this api: Collections.reverse.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Collections.reverse\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nCollections.reverse(Arrays.asList(array));\n<<<explanation>>>: The reverse() method of the Collections class reverses the order of the elements in the specified list.\nQuestion: How can I find the maximum value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint max = Arrays.stream(array).max().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The max() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalInt that represents the maximum element of this stream. The getAsInt() method returns the value of this OptionalInt.\nQuestion: How can I find the minimum value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint min = Arrays.stream(array).min().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The min() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalInt that represents the minimum element of this stream. The getAsInt() method returns the value of this OptionalInt.\nQuestion: How can I sort an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.sort.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.sort\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {5, 2, 3, 1, 4};\nArrays.sort(array);\n<<<explanation>>>: The sort() method of the Arrays class sorts the specified array of objects into ascending numerical order.\nQuestion: How can I find the average of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\ndouble average = Arrays.stream(array).average().getAsDouble();\n<<<explanation>>>: The average() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalDouble that represents the average of the elements of this stream. The getAsDouble() method returns the value of this OptionalDouble.\n\n\nA: Here is how you can do it:\n\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nAnswer:\n```java\nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n```\n\nQuestion: BufferedReader space separated input:\nAnswer:\n```java\nBufferedReader input = new BufferedReader (new InputStreamReader (System.in));\nStringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(input.readLine());\nint x = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\nString y = st.nextToken();\n```\n\nQuestion: How can I create a new array with the elements of another array in reverse order?\nAnswer:\n```java\nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nCollections.reverse(Arrays.asList(array));\n```\n\nQuestion: How can I find the maximum value in an array in Java?\nAnswer:\n```java\nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint max = Arrays.stream(array).max().getAsInt();\n```\n\nQuestion: How can I find the minimum value in an array in Java?"}
