AES requires that the input data be a multiple of 16 bytes long.\nThe error message \"Input length must be multiple of 16 when decrypting with padded cipher\" is telling you that the length of the data you're trying to decrypt isn't a multiple of 16.\nThe line of code that's causing the error is:\nbyte[] encrypt = cipher2.doFinal(result_Bytes);\n\nThe length of result_Bytes is likely not a multiple of 16, which is causing the IllegalBlockSizeException.\nYou need to ensure that the data you're sending from the server to the client is a multiple of 16 bytes long. If it's not, you'll need to pad it out to be a multiple of 16 bytes.\nHere's an example of how you might pad your data:\nbyte[] feedback = \"Your answer is wrong\".getBytes();\nint paddingLength = 16 - (feedback.length % 16);\nbyte[] paddedFeedback = new byte[feedback.length + paddingLength];\nSystem.arraycopy(feedback, 0, paddedFeedback, 0, feedback.length);\nfor (int i = 0; i < paddingLength; i++) {\n    paddedFeedback[feedback.length + i] = (byte) paddingLength;\n}\ndos.writeInt(paddedFeedback.length);\ndos.write(paddedFeedback);\n\nAnd then on the client side, you'll need to remove the padding when you decrypt the data:\nbyte[] encrypt = cipher2.doFinal(result_Bytes);\nint paddingLength = encrypt[encrypt.length - 1] & 0xFF;\nbyte[] decrypted = new byte[encrypt.length - paddingLength];\nSystem.arraycopy(encrypt, 0, decrypted, 0, decrypted.length);\nString decryptedText = new String(decrypted);\n\nThis code assumes that the last byte of the encrypted data is the length of the padding, which is a common way to pad data. If your data doesn't use this method of padding, you'll need to adjust the code to match your specific requirements.\n\nA: The error is because the data you're trying to decrypt isn't in a format that AES can decrypt. AES requires that the input data be a multiple of 16 bytes long.\nThe error message"}
