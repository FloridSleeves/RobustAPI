The Function.identity() function is used to classify elements by their identity, i.e., by their value. The counting() collector is used to count the number of elements in each group.\nQuestion: How can I sort a list of integers in descending order in Java?\nPlease using this api: Collections.sort.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Collections.sort\n<<<code>>>: List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(5, 1, 9, 3, 7);\nCollections.sort(numbers, Collections.reverseOrder());\n<<<explanation>>>: The sort() method of the Collections class sorts the elements of a list in a specific order. The reverseOrder() method returns a comparator that imposes the reverse of the natural ordering. So, this will sort the list in descending order.\n\n```\n\n## AI's answer:\n```\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.
