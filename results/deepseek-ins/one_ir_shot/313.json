The first element is stored in the variable firstElement, and is returned on the first call to next() and then the original iterator's next() is called.\n\n\nA: Here is how you can calculate the sum of an array using Java 8's Stream API:\n\n```java\nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n```\n\nThis code creates a stream from the array, then uses the sum() method to calculate the sum of the elements in the stream.\n\nAs for your second question, you can create a wrapper around the original iterator to return the first element and then continue with the original iterator:\n\n```java\nIterator<String> it = ...; // your iterator\nString firstElement = it.next(); // retrieve the first element\nIterator<String> newIt = new Iterator<String>() {\n    boolean first = true;\n    @Override\n    public boolean hasNext() {\n        return it.hasNext();\n    }\n    @Override\n    public String next() {\n        if (first) {\n            first = false;\n            return firstElement;\n        }\n        return it.next();\n    }\n};\n```\n\nIn this code, the newIt iterator will always return the first element first, and then continue with the original iterator. The first element is stored in the variable firstElement, and is returned on the first call to next() and then the original iterator's next() is called.\n\nThis solution does not change the signature or implementation of the original iterator, and it is more elegant and general.\n\nNote: The Iterator.next() API is used to retrieve the next element from the iterator. The Iterator.next() method returns the next element in the iteration and throws a NoSuchElementException if there are no more elements in the iteration.\n\n```java\nIterator<String> it = ...; // your iterator\nString firstElement = it.next(); // retrieve the first element\n```\n\nIn this code, the firstElement variable will hold the first element from the iterator. The next() method of the iterator is used to retrieve this first element.\n\nThis solution does not change the signature or implementation of the original iterator, and it is more elegant and general.\n\nNote: The Iterator.next() API is used to retrieve the next element from the iterator. The Iterator.next() method returns the next element in the iteration and throws a NoSuchElementException if there are no more elements in the iteration.\n\n```java\nIterator<String> it = ...; // your iterator\nString firstElement = it.next(); // retrieve the first element\n```\n\nIn this code, the firstElement variable will hold the first element from the iterator.
