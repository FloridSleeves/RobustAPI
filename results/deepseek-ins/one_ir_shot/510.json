DynamicIterator it = new DynamicIterator(da);say da is an array the output will be [1,2,3,4,5,6] instead of 1,2,3,4,5,6My issue is, more than anything, understanding the generally accepted practice for dealing with this more than the issue itself.edit for code:public class X<E>{    private final E[] rray;    private int currentIndex = 0;    public X(E... a)     {        //if the incoming array is null, don't start        if(a == null)        {            System.out.println(\"Array is null\");            System.exit(1);        }        //set the temp array (rray) to the incoming array (a)        this.rray = a;    }    //hasNext element?    public boolean hasNext()    {        return rray.length > currentIndex;    }    //next element (depends on hasNext())    public E next()    {        if (!hasNext())        {            System.out.println(\"Element doesn't exist, done\");            System.exit(1);        }        return rray[currentIndex++];    }    //return array    public E[] access()    {        return rray;    }}\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.
