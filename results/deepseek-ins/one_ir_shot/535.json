However, after a specified time (let's say 20 seconds), I want to stop iterating. The problem is that the next() method of the Iterator is blocking, but even so, after a specified time, I just need the iteration to stop.Here is my example Iterable and Iterator to simulate my problem.public class EndlessIterable implements Iterable<String> {    static class EndlessIterator implements Iterator<String> {         public boolean hasNext() { return true; }         public String next() {              return \"\" + System.currentTimeMillis(); //in reality, this code does some long running task, so it's blocking         }    }   public Iterator<String> iterator() { return new EndlessIterator(); }}Here is my code to test.EndlessIterable iterable = new EndlessIterable();for(String s : iterable) { System.out.println(s); }I wanted to put code/logic into the Iterable class to create a Timer, so after the specified time is up, an exception will be thrown so as to stop the iteration. public class EndlessIterable implements Iterable<String> {    static class EndlessIterator implements Iterator<String> {        public boolean hasNext() { return true; }        public String next() {             try { Thread.sleep(2000); } catch(Exception) { } //just sleep for a while            return \"\" + System.currentTimeMillis(); //in reality, this code does some long running task, so it's blocking        }    }    static class ThrowableTimerTask extends TimerTask {        private Timer timer;        public ThrowableTimerTask(Timer timer) { this.timer = timer; }        public void run() {            this.timer.cancel();            throw new RuntimeException(\"out of time!\");        }    }    private Timer timer;    private long maxTime = 20000; //20 seconds    public EndlessIterable(long maxTime) {        this.maxTime = maxTime;        this.timer = new Timer(true);    }    public Iterator<String> iterator() {         this.timer.schedule(new ThrowableTimerTask(this.timer), maxTime, maxTime);        return new EndlessIterator();    }}I then try to test this code as follows.EndlessIterable iterable = new EndlessIterable(5000);try {    for(String s : iterable) { System.out.println(s); }} catch(Exception) {    System.out.println(\"exception detected: \" + e.getMessage());}System.out.println(\"done\");What I noticed is that the RuntimeException is thrown after the time is up, however, the for loop keeps going,the catch block is never reached, andi never reach the end of the code (printing done).Any strategy, approach or design pattern to resolve this problem I've described?

This is a terminal operation.\n\n\nA: The problem you're experiencing is due to the fact that the TimerTask is being scheduled to run after the specified time, but the TimerTask is being cancelled before it has a chance to run. This means that the RuntimeException is thrown before the for loop has a chance to finish.\n\nTo resolve this, you should cancel the TimerTask as soon as the Iterator has started. This can be done by moving the timer.schedule() call to the iterator() method of the EndlessIterable class.\n\nHere is the modified code:\n\n```java\npublic class EndlessIterable implements Iterable<String> {\n    static class EndlessIterator implements Iterator<String> {\n        private Timer timer;\n        public EndlessIterator(Timer timer) {\n            this.timer = timer;\n        }\n        public boolean hasNext() {\n            return true;\n        }\n        public String next() {\n            try {\n                Thread.sleep(20"}
