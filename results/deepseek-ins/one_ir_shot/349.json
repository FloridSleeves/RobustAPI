NOTE : At first i tried using ImageIcon to add to JPanel but it could not work hence i found this solution which lead to my current problem.

This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I add an image to a JPanel in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: JLabel\n<<<code>>>: JLabel imageLabel = new JLabel(new ImageIcon(\"path_to_your_image.jpg\"));\nJPanel panel = new JPanel();\npanel.add(imageLabel);\n<<<explanation>>>: JLabel is used to display an image. The ImageIcon class is used to load the image. The image is then added to a JPanel using the add() method.\nQuestion: How can I read a file in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.lines\n<<<code>>>: List<String> lines = Files.readAllLines(Paths.get(\"path_to_your_file.txt\"));\n<<<explanation>>>: The Files.readAllLines() method returns a list of strings where each string is a line from the file. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I write to a file in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.write\n<<<code>>>: Files.write(Paths.get(\"path_to_your_file.txt\"), \"Hello, World!\".getBytes());\n<<<explanation>>>: The Files.write() method writes the given bytes to the specified file. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I create a new file in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.createFile\n<<<code>>>: Files.createFile(Paths.get(\"path_to_your_file.txt\"));\n<<<explanation>>>: The Files.createFile() method creates a new, empty file. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I delete a file in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.delete\n<<<code>>>: Files.delete(Paths.get(\"path_to_your_file.txt\"));\n<<<explanation>>>: The Files.delete() method deletes the file denoted by this path. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I check if a file exists in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.exists\n<<<code>>>: boolean exists = Files.exists(Paths.get(\"path_to_your_file.txt\"));\n<<<explanation>>>: The Files.exists() method checks if the file denoted by this path exists. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I get the size of a file in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.size\n<<<code>>>: long size = Files.size(Paths.get(\"path_to_your_file.txt\"));\n<<<explanation>>>: The Files.size() method returns the size of the file in bytes. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I create a directory in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.createDirectory\n<<<code>>>: Files.createDirectory(Paths.get(\"path_to_your_directory\"));\n<<<explanation>>>: The Files.createDirectory() method creates a new directory. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I delete a directory in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.delete\n<<<code>>>: Files.delete(Paths.get(\"path_to_your_directory\"));\n<<<explanation>>>: The Files.delete() method deletes the directory or file denoted by this path. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I check if a directory exists in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.exists\n<<<code>>>: boolean exists = Files.exists(Paths.get(\"path_to_your_directory\"));\n<<<explanation>>>: The Files.exists() method checks if the directory or file denoted by this path exists. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I list the files in a directory in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.list\n<<<code>>>: Files.list(Paths.get(\"path_to_your_directory\")).forEach(System.out::println);\n<<<explanation>>>: The Files"}
