Explanation:\n\n```markdown\nQuestion 1:\nThe sum of the array elements can be calculated using the sum() method of the IntStream class. This method returns the sum of elements in the stream.\n\nQuestion 2:\nTo make a LinkedHashMap thread-safe, you can use synchronized blocks to ensure that only one thread can access the map at a time. The removeEldestEntry() method is used to make the map behave like a circular queue by removing the oldest entry when the size exceeds a certain limit.\n\nQuestion 3:\nA thread-safe queue can be created using the take() method of the BlockingQueue interface. This method removes and returns the head of the queue, waiting if necessary until an element becomes available. This is a blocking operation, meaning the thread will be blocked until an element is available.\n```\n\n## 4. Output:\n\n```markdown\nSum of array elements: 15\nValue of key1: value1\n```\n\n## 5.
