I want to get another array that gives me the ranking of the players based on their scores.For example: Given the scores {10,20,15,40}I want the ranking to be {4,2,3,1}The lowest score being rank 4 and the highest score being rank 1.The biggest problem is when there are multiple players with the same score. For example {10,10,20,40} then I want to get {34,34,2,1} (34 because the third and fourth place are shared by two players)Another example is {40,40,10,20}, which should give the ranking {12,12,4,3} (12 for shared first and second place)I have for the moment two dubble arrays to come to that result, but I think it can be better, but I don't find how. My biggest problem now is when we have 3 same scores: {40,40,40,10} than I should have the result {123,123,123,4}I hope you understand my question and of course can help me to find a solution.thanks\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.
