This is a terminal operation.\n\n\nA: Here are the answers to your questions:\n\nHow can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\n\nYou can use the Arrays.stream API to calculate the sum of an array. Here is an example:\n\n```java\nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n```\n\nIn this example, `Arrays.stream(array)` creates"}
