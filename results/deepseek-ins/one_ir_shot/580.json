This method is applicable for all JSON types.\nQuestion: How can I create a custom annotation in Java?\nPlease using this api: @interface.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: @interface\n<<<code>>>: @interface CustomAnnotation {\n    String value();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: In Java, an annotation is a marker that helps to associate metadata with Java elements such as classes, methods, variables, etc. The @interface keyword is used to declare an annotation. The annotation itself can contain elements which can be of any type including other annotations.\nQuestion: What is the difference between the '==' and 'equals()' operator in Java?\nPlease using this api: == and equals()\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: == and equals()\n<<<code>>>: int a = 10;\nint b = 10;\nString str1 = new String(\"Hello\");\nString str2 = new String(\"Hello\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The '==' operator compares the memory locations of two objects. If the memory locations are the same, then the result is true. If the memory locations are different, then the result is false.\nThe 'equals()' method, on the other hand, compares the actual content of the objects. It checks whether the two objects are logically equivalent. The 'equals()' method is used to compare the values of two objects. It is used in the String class to compare the content of two strings.\nQuestion: What is the difference between '==' and '===' in JavaScript?\nPlease using this api: == and ===\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: == and ===\n<<<code>>>: let a = 10;\nlet b = \"10\";\n<<<explanation>>>: The '==' operator in JavaScript compares the values of two operands. If the values are equal, it returns true, otherwise it returns false.\nThe '===' operator in JavaScript is called a strict equality operator. It compares both the type and value of the two operands. If both the values and types are equal, it returns true, otherwise it returns false.\nQuestion: What is the difference between '==' and '===' in Python?\nPlease using this api: == and ===\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: == and ===\n<<<code>>>: a = 10\nb = \"10\"\n<<<explanation>>>: The '==' operator in Python is used for equality comparison. It checks if the values of two operands are equal or not. If they are equal, the condition becomes true.\nThe '===' operator in Python is used for identity comparison. It checks if the two variables point to the same object or not. If they do, the condition becomes true.\n\n```\n\n## AI's answer:\n```\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nAnswer:\n<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.
