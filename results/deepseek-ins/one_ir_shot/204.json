I already know that I can check a system property \"sun.arch.data.model\", but this is Sun-specific. I'm wondering if there is a standard solution for this.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.

To create a new thread, you need to instantiate a Thread object and call the start() method on it. The start() method causes the object's run method to be called in that separately executing thread.\nQuestion: How can I create a new thread in Java?\nPlease using this api: Thread.start.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Thread\n<<<code>>>: new Thread(() -> System.out.println(\"New Thread\")).start();\n<<<explanation>>>: The Thread class in Java represents a thread of execution in a program.
