The `BufferedReader.readLine()` method is used to read each line, and the loop continues until there are no more lines to read (i.e., until `readLine()` returns `null`).\n\nPlease replace \"filename.txt\" with your actual file name.\n\nThis code uses a `try-catch` block to handle any `IOException` that might occur while reading the file. If an `IOException` is thrown, the `catch` block will execute, and the `e.printStackTrace()` line will print the stack trace to the console.\n\nNote: Always remember to close the `BufferedReader` after you're done reading the file to free up system resources.\n\nAlso, make sure that the file you're trying to read is in the same directory as your Java program, or provide the full path to the file.\n\nThis is a basic way to read a file in Java. Depending on your needs, you might want to add error handling and other features.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>"}
