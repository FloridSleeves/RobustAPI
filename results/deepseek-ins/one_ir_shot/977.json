Code:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Arrays;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Question 1\n        int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\n        int sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n        System.out.println(\"Sum of array: \" + sum);\n\n        // Question 2\n        String str = \"Hello, World!\";\n        byte[] bytes = str.getBytes();\n        System.out.println(\"Size of string in memory: \" + bytes.length);\n\n        // Question 3\n        int[] array2 = {5, 2, 8, 1, 9};\n        Arrays.sort(array2);\n        System.out.println(\"Sorted array: \" + Arrays.toString(array2));\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## 3. Explanation:\n\nThe code above demonstrates how to use the APIs provided in the question.\n\n1. In the first part, we use the `Arrays.stream` API to calculate the sum of an array. The `sum()` method of the `IntStream` class returns the sum of elements in this stream.\n\n2. In the second part, we use the `String.getBytes` API to measure the size of a string in memory. The `getBytes()` method of the `String` class returns an array of bytes representing the characters in the string.\n\n3. In the third part, we use the `Arrays.sort` API to sort an array. The `sort()` method of the `Arrays` class sorts the specified array of objects into ascending numerical order.\n\nWhen you run this code, it will print the sum of the array, the size of the string in memory, and the sorted array.\n\n```\nSum of array: 15\nSize of string in memory: 13\nSorted array: [1, 2, 5, 8, 9]\n```\n\nThis shows that the sum of the array is 15, the size of the string in memory is 13 bytes, and the sorted array is [1, 2, 5, 8, 9].\n\nNote: The actual memory size of an object in Java can be more than the size of the object itself due to factors like memory alignment, padding, and other factors. Therefore, the size of the string in memory might be larger than the length of the string.\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n"}
