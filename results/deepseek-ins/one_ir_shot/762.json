Sometimes I need to use Writer, sometimes a PrintWriter, sometimes a OutputStream... One way to do this would be to extend a PrintWriter to have an array of PrintWriters and override each method as follows:\n\nclass MultiplePrintWriter extends PrintWriter {\n    private PrintWriter[] outs;\n\n    public MultiplePrintWriter(PrintWriter[] outs) {\n        this.outs = outs;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void print(boolean b) {\n        for (PrintWriter out : outs) {\n            out.print(b);\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Override other methods similarly\n}\n\nHowever, this is quite a bit of work and there may be a library that already provides this functionality.\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: \nPrintWriter writer1 = new PrintWriter(\"file1.txt\");\nPrintWriter writer2 = new PrintWriter(\"file2.txt\");\nPrintWriter writer3 = new PrintWriter(\"file3.txt\");\nPrintWriter[] writers = {writer1, writer2, writer3};\nfor (PrintWriter writer : writers) {\n    writer.write(\"Hello, World!\");\n    writer.flush();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The write() method of the PrintWriter class writes a string to the underlying output stream.
