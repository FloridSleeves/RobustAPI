There is a server which has been written in python like this which I shouldn't not change.s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)s.connect((TCP_IP, TCP_PORT))s.send('from server\\nnewline\\0')data = s.recv(BUFFER_SIZE)s.close()Now I want to write a code in Java which read the string from a server. Something like this:public static String readStr(Socket client) throws IOException {        InputStreamReader inStream = new InputStreamReader(                client.getInputStream());        BufferedReader inBuff = new BufferedReader(inStream);        String answer = new String();        String str = inBuff.readLine();        while (str!=null) {            answer = answer.concat(str + \"\\n\");            str = inBuff.readLine();        }        answer = answer.substring(0, answer.length() - 1);        System.out.println(\"answer:\\n \"+answer);        return answer;    }But it seems that it blocks at line str = inBuff.readLine(); at the last line of the message.

Returns the next byte of data, or -1 if the end of the stream is reached.\nQuestion: How can I read a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.readAllLines.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.readAllLines\n<<<code>>>: List<String> lines = Files.readAllLines(Paths.get(\"file.txt\"), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);\n<<<explanation>>>: The readAllLines() method of the Files class returns a list containing all lines of the specified file. The lines are read using the UTF-8 charset.\nQuestion: How can I write a string to a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.write\n<<<code>>>: Files.write(Paths.get(\"file.txt\"), \"Hello, World!\".getBytes(), StandardOpenOption.CREATE);\n<<<explanation>>>: The write() method of the Files class writes bytes to a file. The file is created if it does not exist. The file is opened for writing only.\nQuestion: How can I read a file line by line in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.lines.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.lines\n<<<code>>>: Files.lines(Paths.get(\"file.txt\"), StandardCharsets.UTF_8).forEach(System.out::println);\n<<<explanation>>>: The lines() method of the Files class returns a Stream that produces lines read from the file. The lines are read using the UTF-8 charset. Each line is produced in the order that they are read.\nQuestion: How can I sort a list of integers in Java?\nPlease using this api: Collections.sort.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Collections.sort\n<<<code>>>: List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(5, 3, 2, 1, 4);\nCollections.sort(list);\n<<<explanation>>>: The sort() method of the Collections class sorts the specified list into ascending order. The sort is not stable.\nQuestion: How can I sort a list of strings in Java?\nPlease using this api: Collections.sort.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Collections.sort\n<<<code>>>: List<String> list = Arrays.asList(\"D\", \"C\", \"E\", \"B\", \"A\");\nCollections.sort(list);\n<<<explanation>>>: The sort() method of the Collections class sorts the specified list into ascending order. The sort is not stable.\nQuestion: How can I sort a list of objects in Java?\nPlease using this api: Collections.sort.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Collections.sort\n<<<code>>>: List<MyObject> list = Arrays.asList(new MyObject(2), new MyObject(1), new MyObject(3));\nCollections.sort(list, Comparator.comparing(MyObject::getValue));\n<<<explanation>>>: The sort() method of the Collections class sorts the specified list into ascending order. The sort is not stable. The Comparator.comparing() method is used to specify the sorting criteria.\nQuestion: How can I reverse a list in Java?\nPlease using this api: Collections.reverse.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Collections.reverse\n<<<code>>>: List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);\nCollections.reverse(list);\n<<<explanation>>>: The reverse() method of the Collections class reverses the order of the elements in the specified list.\nQuestion: How can I shuffle a list in Java?\nPlease using this api: Collections.shuffle.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Collections.shuffle\n<<<code>>>: List<Integer> list = Arrays"}
