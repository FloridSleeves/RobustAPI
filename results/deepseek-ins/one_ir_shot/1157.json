This returns data split by \u00a7. In eclipse, when run as an application, the code works fine. The issue is when I bring it to Android. I have done some research on this but haven't been able to find a working solution. (Have tried Pattern.quote(\"\u00a7\")) Here is an example of what I'm running:String input = \"Look like this\u00a70\u00a725\";String[] data = input.split(\"\u00a7\");The expected data would be a 3-long String[] with the values \"Look like this\", \"0\", and \"25\". This is what happens in eclipse. In android, I get a 1-long String[] with the value \"Look like this\u00a70\u00a725\".

The tokens are delimited by delimiters. In this case, the delimiter is the \"\u00a7\" character. The countTokens() method returns the number of tokens in the string. This is used to create the correct size of the String array.\nQuestion: How can I find the maximum value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint max = Arrays.stream(array).max().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The max() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalInt that represents the maximum element of this stream. The getAsInt() method returns the value of this OptionalInt, or throws NoSuchElementException if there is no value.\nQuestion: How can I find the minimum value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint min = Arrays.stream(array).min().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The min() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalInt that represents the minimum element of this stream. The getAsInt() method returns the value of this OptionalInt, or throws NoSuchElementException if there is no value.\nQuestion: How can I find the average of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\ndouble average = Arrays.stream(array).average().getAsDouble();\n<<<explanation>>>: The average() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalDouble that represents the average of the elements of this stream. The getAsDouble() method returns the value of this OptionalDouble, or throws NoSuchElementException if there is no value.\nQuestion: How can I find the sum of the squares of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sumOfSquares = Arrays.stream(array).map(n -> n * n).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The map() method of the IntStream class returns a stream consisting of the results of applying the given function to the elements of this stream. In this case, we're squaring each element of the array. The sum() method then calculates the sum of these squared elements.\nQuestion: How can I find the product of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint product = Arrays.stream(array).reduce(1, (a, b) -> a * b);\n<<<explanation>>>: The reduce() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalInt that represents the reduction of the elements of this stream according to the provided binary operator. In this case, we're multiplying the elements together. The initial value of the reduction is provided as the second argument (1 in this case).\nQuestion: How can I find the sum of the cubes of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sumOfCubes = Arrays.stream(array).map(n -> n * n * n).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>"}
