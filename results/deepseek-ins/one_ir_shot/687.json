I have watched countless videos and am utterly lost at this point.  the examples in the text are for one main method that outputs the text.

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\n\nA: Here is how you can calculate the sum of an array in Java using Arrays.stream:\n\n```java\nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n```\n\nIn this code, `Arrays.stream(array)` creates a stream of integers from the array. The `sum()` method then calculates the sum of these integers. The result is stored in the `sum` variable.\n\nAs for your question about where to put the text file commands, it's generally a good idea to separate the concerns of your code. This means that you should have a separate method for writing to the text file, and pass the necessary data to that method. Here's an example of how you might do this:\n\n```java\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    int randomNumbers[] = new int [1000];\n    for (int i = 0; i < randomNumbers.length; ++i) {\n        randomNumbers[i] = 1 + (int)(Math.random() * 10);\n    }\n    int[] freq = calcFrequency(randomNumbers);\n    double average = calcAverage(randomNumbers);\n    writeToFile(randomNumbers, freq, average);\n}\n\npublic static void writeToFile(int[] randomNumbers, int[] freq, double average) {\n    try {\n        PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"randomIntegers.txt\", \"UTF-8\");\n        writer.write(\"Average: \" + average + \"\\n\");\n        writer.write(\"Frequency: \" + Arrays.toString(freq) + \"\\n\");\n        writer.close();\n    } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `writeToFile` method takes the arrays and the average as parameters, and writes them to a text file using a `PrintWriter`. The `try-catch` block is used to handle any `FileNotFoundException` that might occur if the file cannot be opened.\n\nI hope this helps clarify things for you. Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\n\nA: Here is how you can calculate the sum of an array in Java using Arrays.stream:\n\n```java\nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n```\n\nIn this code, `Arrays.stream(array)` creates a stream of integers from the array.
