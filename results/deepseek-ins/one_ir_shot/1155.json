If I were to use a couple of Arrays I could have done it a while ago but having to use the StringTokenizer is driving me nuts. The main problem I am having is reading the CSV file. I don't know how to do it and previous searches online have only brought forward super intense solutions that are too much for a beginner like me to handle. This is my code. As you can see, I don't know whether use .nextLine() or .NextToken(). Neither seems to work.For those wondering the assignment is basically reading the first 4 products separated by commas and reading the rest of the rows as the rating of those 4 products.

It is a simple text scanner which can parse primitive types and strings using regular expressions.\nQuestion: How can I read a CSV file in Java?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"file.csv\"));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    String[] values = line.split(\",\");\n    // process values\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The BufferedReader class in Java is used to read the content from a character-input stream. It buffers characters so as to provide for the efficient reading of characters, arrays, and lines.\n```\n\n## Answer:\nSure, here is the corrected version of your code:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.StringTokenizer;\nimport java.io.BufferedReader;\nimport java.io.FileReader;\nimport java.io.IOException;\n\npublic class ProductRating {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"C:/Users/Cristian/Desktop/file.csv\"))) {\n            String line;\n            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n                StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(line, \",\");\n                while (st.hasMoreTokens()) {\n                    String token = st.nextToken();\n                    // process token\n                }\n            }\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, we use a `BufferedReader` to read the lines from the CSV file. For each line, we use a `StringTokenizer` to split the line into tokens based on the comma delimiter. The `hasMoreTokens()` method is used to check if there are more tokens left in the line, and the `nextToken()` method is used to get the next token.\n\nPlease replace `\"C:/Users/Cristian/Desktop/file.csv\"` with your actual CSV file path.\n\nNote: The `try-with-resources` statement is used to automatically close the `BufferedReader` after it is no longer needed. This is a good practice to follow to ensure that resources are properly cleaned up.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>"}
