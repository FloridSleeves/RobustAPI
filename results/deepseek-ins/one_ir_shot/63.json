The transformation is a string that specifies the algorithm and any provider-specific transformation requirements.\nQuestion: How can I read a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.readAllBytes.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Files.readAllBytes\n<<<code>>>: byte[] bytes = Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get(\"file.txt\"));\n<<<explanation>>>: The readAllBytes() method of the Files class returns the content of the file as a byte array.\nQuestion: How can I write a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.write.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Files.write\n<<<code>>>: Files.write(Paths.get(\"file.txt\"), \"Hello, World!\".getBytes());\n<<<explanation>>>: The write() method of the Files class writes the given bytes to the specified file. If the file does not exist, it will be created. If it does exist, it will be replaced.\nQuestion: How can I read a file line by line in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.lines.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Files.lines\n<<<code>>>: Files.lines(Paths.get(\"file.txt\")).forEach(line -> System.out.println(line));\n<<<explanation>>>: The lines() method of the Files class returns a Stream of lines read from the file. The forEach() method of the Stream class performs an action for each element of the stream.\nQuestion: How can I write a file line by line in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.write.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Files.write\n<<<code>>>: List<String> lines = Arrays.asList(\"Hello, World!\");\nFiles.write(Paths.get(\"file.txt\"), lines, StandardOpenOption.CREATE);\n<<<explanation>>>: The write() method of the Files class can also be used to write a list of strings to a file. The StandardOpenOption.CREATE option is used to create a new file if it does not exist.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\n\n\nA: The problem is that you're not using the CipherInputStream correctly. The CipherInputStream should be used to read from the input stream, not to write to it. \n\nThe CipherInputStream class provides a filter for converting the bytes read from another input stream. The bytes are decrypted using a Cipher object.\n\nIn your case, you're trying to read from the CipherInputStream, which is a write-only stream. You should be using the CipherOutputStream to write to the file, and then use the CipherInputStream to read from the file.\n\nHere is an example of how you can use the CipherOutputStream to write to a file:\n\n```java\nCipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES\");\ncipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, aesKeySpec);\n\ntry (FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(\"file.txt\");\n     CipherOutputStream cos = new CipherOutputStream(fos, cipher)) {\n    cos.write(\"Hello, World!\".getBytes());\n}\n```\n\nAnd here is an example of how you can use the CipherInputStream to read from the file:\n\n```java\nCipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES\");\ncipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, aesKeySpec);\n\ntry (FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(\"file.txt\");\n     CipherInputStream cis = new CipherInputStream(fis, cipher)) {\n    byte[]"}
