Why is this happening and how do I fix this?\nAnswer: The problem might be that you are creating a new Snake object for each iteration in your for loop. Each Snake object has its own ShapeRenderer and SpriteBatch, which are large objects. If you have a lot of Snake objects, you might be running out of memory. \n\nTo fix this, you should only create the ShapeRenderer and SpriteBatch once, and reuse them for each Snake object. Here's an example of how you can do this:\n\n```java\nShapeRenderer shapeRenderer = new ShapeRenderer();\nSpriteBatch batch = new SpriteBatch();\n\npublic void snake() {\n    snake.add(new Snake(ball.getX(), ball.getY(), shapeRenderer, batch));\n    currentTime++;\n    for(Snake currentSnake: snake) {\n        if(currentSnake.creationDate < SnakeLength){\n            currentSnake.Update();\n        } else {\n            Gdx.app.log(\"SnakeLength\" + SnakeLength, \"CreationDate\" + currentSnake.creationDate);\n            snake.remove(currentSnake);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Snake{\n    // ... other code ...\n    ShapeRenderer shapeRenderer;\n    SpriteBatch batch;\n\n    public Snake(float x, float y, ShapeRenderer shapeRenderer, SpriteBatch batch) {\n        this.shapeRenderer = shapeRenderer;\n        this.batch = batch;\n        this.x = x;\n        this.y = y;\n    }\n    // ... other code ...\n}\n```\n\nThis way, you are only creating a new ShapeRenderer and SpriteBatch for each Snake object, which should help to prevent your game from running out of memory.\n\nQuestion: How to create a custom exception in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: throw new Exception(\"Custom Exception Message\");\n<<<code>>>: public class CustomException extends Exception {\n    public CustomException(String message) {\n        super(message);\n    }\n}\n\nthrow new CustomException(\"This is a custom exception\");\n<<<explanation>>>: In Java, a custom exception can be created by extending the Exception class.
