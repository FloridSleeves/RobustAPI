This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to specify your own logging messages: :At work, I was asked to find a way of creating a customised logging level system that would output to a .log file. I found a way that works really well, so I thought I'd share.

It has an initial capacity of 10 and it increases its size by 50% when it is full.\nQuestion: How to create a map in Java?\nPlease using this api: new HashMap<>.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: new HashMap<>\n<<<code>>>: Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();\nmap.put(\"One\", 1);\nmap.put(\"Two\", 2);\n<<<explanation>>>: The HashMap class in Java is a part of the Java collections framework. It implements the Map interface and provides key-value storage. It is generally used when we want to store data in a pair.\nQuestion: How to create a set in Java?\nPlease using this api: new HashSet<>.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: new HashSet<>\n<<<code>>>: Set<String> set = new HashSet<>();\nset.add(\"Hello\");\nset.add(\"World\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The HashSet class in Java is a part of the Java collections framework. It implements the Set interface and provides a collection of unique elements. It does not allow duplicate elements.\nQuestion: How to create a queue in Java?\nPlease using this api: new LinkedList<>.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: new LinkedList<>\n<<<code>>>: Queue<String> queue = new LinkedList<>();\nqueue.add(\"Hello\");\nqueue.add(\"World\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The LinkedList class in Java is a part of the Java collections framework. It implements the List interface and provides a doubly-linked list. It allows insertion and removal of elements from both ends of the list.\nQuestion: How to create a stack in Java?\nPlease using this api: new Stack<>.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: new Stack<>\n<<<code>>>: Stack<String> stack = new Stack<>();\nstack.push(\"Hello\");\nstack.push(\"World\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The Stack class in Java is a part of the Java collections framework. It implements the List interface and provides a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack. It allows insertion and removal of elements from the same end of the list.\nQuestion: How to create a priority queue in Java?\nPlease using this api: new PriorityQueue<>.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: new PriorityQueue<>\n<<<code>>>: PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>();\npq.add(3);\npq.add(1);\npq.add(2);\n<<<explanation>>>: The PriorityQueue class in Java is a part of the Java collections framework. It implements the Queue interface and provides an ordered collection of elements. The elements are ordered according to their natural ordering, or by a Comparator provided at queue construction time.\nQuestion: How to create a tree set in Java?\nPlease using this api: new TreeSet<>.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: new TreeSet<>\n<<<code>>>: SortedSet<String> set = new TreeSet<>();\nset.add(\"Hello\");\nset.add(\"World\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The TreeSet class in Java is a part of the Java collections framework. It implements the SortedSet interface and provides a sorted set of elements. It is based on a Red-Black tree. It does not allow duplicate elements.\nQuestion: How to create a tree map in Java?\nPlease using this api: new TreeMap<>.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: new TreeMap<>\n<<<code>>>: SortedMap<String, Integer> map = new TreeMap<>();\nmap.put(\"One\", 1);\nmap"}
