The returned array includes both public, private, and protected fields, as well as fields declared by the classes or interfaces that are superclasses or superinterfaces of the class or interface represented by this object.\n\n\nA: Here is the solution for your second question:\n\nPlease using this api: Reflection.\n\nAnswer:\n<<<api>>>: Reflection\n<<<code>>>: \npublic String[] getAllImages() {\n    Field[] fields = Contact.class.getDeclaredFields();\n    List<String> imageFields = new ArrayList<>();\n    for (Field field : fields) {\n        if (field.getType().equals(Image.class)) {\n            imageFields.add(field.getName());\n        }\n    }\n    return imageFields.toArray(new String[0]);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The getDeclaredFields() method returns an array of Field objects reflecting all the fields declared in the class or interface represented by this object. The returned array includes both public, private, and protected fields, as well as fields declared by the classes or interfaces that are superclasses or superinterfaces of the class or interface represented by this object.\n\nIn this code, we are using reflection to get all the fields of the Contact class. We then iterate over these fields and check if their type is Image. If it is, we add their name to the list of image fields. Finally, we convert this list to an array and return it.\n\nPlease note that this code will only work if the fields in the Contact class are public. If they are not, you will need to use the getFields() method instead of getDeclaredFields(), and you will need to handle the case where the fields are private.\n\nAlso, please note that this code will only work if the Image class is accessible from the Contact class. If it is not, you will need to use the getDeclaredClasses() method to get all classes declared in the Contact class, and then check if the Image class is one of them.\n\nI hope this helps you. Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\n\nA: Here is the solution for your first question:\n\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\n\nAnswer:\n<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\n\nIn this code, we are using the Arrays.stream() method to convert the array into a Stream. Then we call the sum() method on this stream to calculate the sum of its elements. The result is stored in the variable sum.\n\nThis is a simple and efficient way to calculate the sum of an array in Java using the Stream API.\n\nI hope this helps you.
