I have never really worked with networking too much, so the issue is figuring out how to send packets correctly. I am currently at the position of creating the handshake with the server. After hours of research, I have come up with the following code, but it always runs into the \"Failed! (Exception)\" message. To me, everything looks correct, but for all I know it could be 100% wrong. If someone could point out what I'm doing wrong here, I'd really appreciate it.For reference, feel free to use this and this.public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {    host = new InetSocketAddress(\"162.244.165.111\", 48040);    socket = new Socket();    System.out.println(\"Connecting...\");    socket.connect(host, 3000);    System.out.println(\"Done!\");    System.out.println(\"Making streams...\");    output = new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());    input = new DataInputStream(socket.getInputStream());    System.out.println(\"Done!\");    System.out.println(\"Attempting handshake... \"+host.getAddress().toString().substring(1));    byte[] msg = (\"47;\"+host.getAddress().toString().substring(1)+\";\"+host.getPort()+\";2;\").getBytes(Charset.forName(\"UTF-16\"));    output.writeInt(msg.length+Integer.valueOf(0x00));    output.writeByte(0x00);    output.write(msg);    output.flush();    try {        if (input.readByte() != 0x02)            System.out.println(\"Failed!\");        else            System.out.println(\"Done!\");    } catch (EOFException e) {        System.out.println(\"Failed!

The general contract for write is that one byte is written to the output stream. The byte to be written is the eight low-order bits of the argument b.\nQuestion: How can I convert a string to a byte array in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: String.getBytes()\n<<<code>>>: byte[] bytes = string.getBytes();\n<<<explanation>>>: The getBytes() method of the String class returns a sequence of bytes that represent the string. The bytes are encoded in the platform's default charset.\nQuestion: How can I convert a byte array to a string in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: new String(byte[])\n<<<code>>>: String str = new String(bytes);\n<<<explanation>>>: The constructor of the String class that takes a byte array and a charset can be used to create a string from the byte array. The charset is used to decode the byte array. If the charset is not specified, the platform's default charset is used.\nQuestion: How can I read a file in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.readAllBytes\n<<<code>>>: byte[] bytes = Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get(\"file.txt\"));\n<<<explanation>>>: The readAllBytes method of the Files class reads all bytes from a file into a byte array. The file is specified by a Path. The Paths.get method can be used to obtain a Path from a string that represents the path to the file.\nQuestion: How can I write to a file in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.write\n<<<code>>>: Files.write(Paths.get(\"file.txt\"), bytes);\n<<<explanation>>>: The write method of the Files class writes bytes to a file. The file is specified by a Path. The Paths.get method can be used to obtain a Path from a string that represents the path to the file. The bytes to write are specified as a byte array.\nQuestion: How can I convert a string to an integer in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Integer.parseInt\n<<<code>>>: int i = Integer.parseInt(\"123\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The parseInt method of the Integer class converts a string to an integer. If the string does not represent a valid integer, the method throws a NumberFormatException.\nQuestion: How can I convert an integer to a string in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Integer.toString\n<<<code>>>: String s = Integer.toString(123);\n<<<explanation>>>: The toString method of the Integer class converts an integer to a string.\nQuestion: How can I convert a string to a double in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Double.parseDouble\n<<<code>>>: double d = Double.parseDouble(\"123.456\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The parseDouble method of the Double class converts a string to a double. If the string does not represent a valid double, the method throws a NumberFormatException.\nQuestion: How can I convert a double to a string in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Double.toString\n<<<code>>>: String s = Double.toString(123.456);\n<<<explanation>>>: The toString method of the Double class converts a double to a string.\nQuestion: How can I convert a string to a boolean in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Boolean.parseBoolean\n<<<code>>>: boolean b = Boolean.parseBoolean(\"true\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The parseBoolean method of the Boolean class converts a string to a boolean. The string \"true\" is considered to represent the value true, and any other string is considered to represent the value false. If the string is not one of these two, the method throws a IllegalArgumentException.\nQuestion: How can I convert a boolean to a string in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Boolean.toString\n<<<code>>>: String s = Boolean.toString(true);\n<<<explanation>>>: The toString method of the Boolean class converts a boolean to a string. The string \"true\" is returned if the boolean is true, and the string \"false\" is"}
