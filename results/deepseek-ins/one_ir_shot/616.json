This is a intermediate operation. The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a terminal operation.\n\n\nA: You can use the flatMapToInt method of the Arrays class to flatten the 2D array into a 1D array, and then use the sum method to calculate the sum.\nHere is an example:\nint[][] array = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).flatMapToInt(Arrays::stream).sum();\n\nIn this example, the flatMapToInt method is used to convert each 1D array in the 2D array into an IntStream. The sum method is then used to calculate the sum of all the elements in the 2D array.\n\nA: You can use Java 8's Stream API to calculate the sum of a 2D array. Here is an example:\nint[][] array = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array)\n                .flatMapToInt(Arrays::stream)\n                .sum();\n\nIn this code, Arrays.stream(array) converts the 2D array into a Stream of arrays. The flatMapToInt(Arrays::stream) operation then flattens this Stream of arrays into a Stream of ints. Finally, the sum() operation calculates the sum of all the ints in the Stream.\n\nA: You can use Java 8's Stream API to calculate the sum of a 2D array.

Here's an example:\nMap<String, int[][]> map = new HashMap<>();\nint[][] array1 = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}};\nint[][] array2 = {{7, 8"}
