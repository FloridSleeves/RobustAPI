This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Gets the uncompressed size of this GZIPInputStream?: :I have a GZIPInputStream that I constructed from another ByteArrayInputStream. I want to know the original (uncompressed) length for the gzip data. Although I can read to the end of the GZIPInputStream, then count the number, it will cost much time and waste CPU. I would like to know the size before read it.Is there a similiar method like ZipEntry.getSize() for GZIPInputStream:public long getSize ()Since: API Level 1  Gets the uncompressed size of this ZipEntry.\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.

It returns null if the end of the stream has been reached.\nQuestion: How can I write to a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: FileWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileWriter\n<<<code>>>: FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(file);\nfw.write(\"Hello, World!\");\nfw.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The write() method of the FileWriter class writes text to the file. The text is converted into bytes according to the system's default character encoding.\nQuestion: How can I read a file in Java byte by byte?\nPlease using this api: FileInputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileInputStream\n<<<code>>>: FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(file);\nint b;\nwhile ((b = fis.read()) != -1) {\n    System.out.print((char) b);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The read() method of the FileInputStream class reads the next byte of data from the input stream. It returns a byte value in the range 0 to 255, or -1 if the end of the stream has been reached.\nQuestion: How can I read a file in Java character by character?\nPlease using this api: FileReader.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileReader\n<<<code>>>: FileReader fr = new FileReader(file);\nint c;\nwhile ((c = fr.read()) != -1) {\n    System.out.print((char) c);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The read() method of the FileReader class reads a single character. It returns a character value in the range 0 to 65535, or -1 if the end of the stream has been reached.\n\n```\n\n## Answer:\n\n```\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nAnswer: Arrays.stream\nCode: \nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\nExplanation: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\n\nQuestion: Gets the uncompressed size of this GZIPInputStream?\nAnswer: RandomAccessFile\nCode: \nRandomAccessFile raf = new RandomAccessFile(file, \"r\");\nlong length = raf.length();\nExplanation: The length() method of the RandomAccessFile class returns the length of the file in bytes.\n\nQuestion: How can I read a file in Java line by line?\nAnswer: BufferedReader\nCode: \nBufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\nExplanation: The readLine() method of the BufferedReader class reads a line of text. It returns null if the end of the stream has been reached.\n\nQuestion: How can I write to a file in Java?\nAnswer: FileWriter\nCode: \nFileWriter fw = new FileWriter(file);\nfw.write(\"Hello, World!\");\nfw.close();\nExplanation: The write() method of the FileWriter class writes text to the file.
