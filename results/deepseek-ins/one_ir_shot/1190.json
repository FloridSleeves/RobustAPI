The tokens are delimited by delimiters. In this case, the delimiters are the square brackets. The first token is the number before the colon, and the second token is the number after the colon. We then parse the second token to a float, add 2 to it, format it to two decimal places, and then reconstruct the string.\nQuestion: How can I sort a list of objects in Java?\nPlease using this api: Collections.sort.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Collections.sort\n<<<code>>>: List<MyObject> list = new ArrayList<>();\nCollections.sort(list, new Comparator<MyObject>() {\n    @Override\n    public int compare(MyObject o1, MyObject o2) {\n        return o1.getValue().compareTo(o2.getValue());\n    }\n});\n<<<explanation>>>: The sort() method of the Collections class sorts the elements of the specified list into ascending order. The list is sorted according to the natural ordering of its elements, or by a Comparator provided. In this case, we are sorting a list of MyObject objects by their value field. The compare() method of the Comparator interface is used to determine the order of the elements. It returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as the first argument is less than, equal to, or greater than the second.\n\n```\n\n## Answer:\n```\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nAnswer:\n<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.
