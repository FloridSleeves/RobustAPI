The readUTF() method reads a modified UTF-8 encoded string from the input stream.\nQuestion: How can I convert a string to a byte array in Java?\nPlease using this api: getBytes().\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: getBytes()\n<<<code>>>: String str = \"Hello, World!\";\nbyte[] byteArray = str.getBytes();\n<<<explanation>>>: The getBytes() method of the String class returns a sequence of bytes that represent the string. The bytes are encoded in the platform's default charset.\nQuestion: How can I convert a byte array to a string in Java?\nPlease using this api: new String().\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: new String()\n<<<code>>>: byte[] byteArray = {72, 101, 108, 108, 111, 44, 32, 87, 111, 114, 108, 100, 33};\nString str = new String(byteArray);\n<<<explanation>>>: The new String(byte[] bytes) constructor creates a new String by decoding the specified array of bytes using the platform's default charset.\nQuestion: How can I read a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine().\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine()\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"file.txt\"));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\nbr.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The readLine() method of the BufferedReader class reads a line of text from the input stream. It returns null if the end of the stream has been reached.\nQuestion: How can I write to a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: BufferedWriter.write().\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedWriter.write()\n<<<code>>>: BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(\"file.txt\"));\nbw.write(\"Hello, World!\");\nbw.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The write() method of the BufferedWriter class writes a string to the output stream. The string is translated into bytes according to the platform's default charset.\nQuestion: How can I create a new file in Java?\nPlease using this api: FileOutputStream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileOutputStream\n<<<code>>>: FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(\"file.txt\");\nfos.write(\"Hello, World!\".getBytes());\nfos.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The FileOutputStream class is a subclass of OutputStream that writes output to a file in a file system. The constructors of this class assume that the default encoding is always UTF-8.\nQuestion: How can I append to a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: FileOutputStream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileOutputStream\n<<<code>>>: FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(\"file.txt\", true); // true for append mode\nfos.write(\"Hello, World!\".getBytes());\nfos.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The FileOutputStream constructor with a second parameter of true opens the file in append mode. This means that all data written to the file will be added to the end of the file rather than overwriting existing data.\n\nPlease note that the explanation for the API usage is based on the assumption that you are asking for the usage of the API in Java.
