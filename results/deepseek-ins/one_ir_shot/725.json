If the character is a newline character ('\\n'), then a line break is written and the line break character is also written.

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation. The getAsInt() method returns the value of this OptionalInt, if it is present, otherwise it throws NoSuchElementException.\nQuestion: How can I find the minimum value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint min = Arrays.stream(array).min().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The min() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalInt that represents the minimum element of this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation. The getAsInt() method returns the value of this OptionalInt, if it is present, otherwise it throws NoSuchElementException.\n\n```\n\n## AI's answer\n```\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nAnswer:\n<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: \nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.
