This method may be called repeatedly to get the next element in the iteration. If there are no more elements in the iteration, a NoSuchElementException is thrown.\nQuestion: What is the time complexity of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BFS\n<<<code>>>: None\n<<<explanation>>>: The time complexity of Breadth-First Search (BFS) is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph. This is because BFS visits each vertex and edge once.\n\n\nA: The time complexity of Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph. This is because BFS visits each vertex and edge once.\n\nIn your code, you are using an iterator to traverse through the adjacency list. The time complexity of the iterator's next() method is O(1), which means it takes constant time to get the next element. The hasNext() method also takes O(1) time. Therefore, the time complexity of your code is O(E), where E is the number of edges.\n\nHowever, the overall time complexity of your code is O(V + E), because you are also visiting each vertex once. So, the time complexity of your code is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.\n\nSo, the time complexity of your BFS algorithm is O(V + E).\n\nNote: The time complexity of BFS is O(V + E) in the worst case scenario, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph. This is because BFS visits each vertex and edge once.\n\nIn your code, you are using an iterator to traverse through the adjacency list.
