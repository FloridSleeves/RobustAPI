If there are no more tokens, it will throw a NoSuchElementException.\nQuestion: How can I read a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"file.txt\"));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The readLine() method of the BufferedReader class reads a line of text. It returns null if the end of the stream has been reached.\nQuestion: How can I write to a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: BufferedWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(\"file.txt\"));\nwriter.write(\"Hello, World!\");\nwriter.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The write() method of the BufferedWriter class writes text to the file. The text is not automatically written to the file until the flush() method is called.\nQuestion: How can I handle exceptions in Java?\nPlease using this api: try-catch-finally.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: try-catch-finally\n<<<code>>>: \ntry {\n    // code that may throw an exception\n} catch (ExceptionType name) {\n    // code to handle exception\n} finally {\n    // code to be executed regardless of whether an exception occurred\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The try-catch-finally block in Java is used to handle exceptions. The try block contains the code that may throw an exception. The catch block contains the code to handle the exception. The finally block contains the code to be executed regardless of whether an exception occurred.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
