This is a terminal operation.\n\n\nA: The content of the multipart entity can be read using the getInputStream() method of the HttpServletRequest. Here is an example:\nprotected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException {\n    InputStream is = request.getInputStream();\n    int c;\n    while ((c = is.read()) != -1) {\n        System.out.print((char) c);\n    }\n}\n\nThis code reads the input stream byte by byte and prints it to the console. If you want to process the content in some other way, you can replace the print statement with your own code.\nNote: This code assumes that the content of the multipart entity is text. If the content is binary data, you will need to handle the data differently.\n\nA: If you want to get the content of the multipart entity, you can use Apache HttpComponents library's HttpEntityUtils.toString() method.\nHere is an example:\nprotected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException {\n    String content = HttpEntityUtils.toString(request.getEntity());\n    System.out.println(content);\n}\n\nThis code reads the entire entity into a String. If the entity is large, this may not be efficient. If you need to process the content in chunks, you can use the InputStream directly.\nNote: HttpEntityUtils.toString() method internally uses InputStream.read().\n\nA: You can use the below code to read the content of the multipart entity:\nprotected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException {\n    InputStream inputStream = request.getInputStream();\n    byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\n    int bytesNumRead = 0;\n    while ((bytesNumRead = inputStream.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n        System.out.write(buffer, 0, bytesNumRead);\n    }\n}\n\nThis code reads the input stream byte by byte and writes it to the standard output. If you want to process the content in some other way, you can replace the print statement with your own code.\nNote: This code assumes that the content of the multipart entity is text. If the content is binary data, you will need to handle the data differently.\n\nA: If you want to get the content of the multipart entity, you can use the below code:\nprotected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException {\n    InputStream inputStream = request.getInputStream();\n    byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\n    int bytesNumRead = 0;\n    while (("}
