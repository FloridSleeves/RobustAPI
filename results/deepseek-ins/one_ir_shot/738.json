Thanks for everyone's help. Case closed, goodnight :)\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter outputFile = new PrintWriter(\"BigMoneys.txt\");\noutputFile.write(outputTextArea.getText());\n<<<explanation>>>: The write(int c) method of the Writer class writes a single character. The character to be written is given as an int. This method is used for writing single characters.\nQuestion: How can I read a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"filename.txt\"));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The readLine() method of the BufferedReader class reads a line of text. A line is considered to be terminated by any one of a line feed ('\\n'), a carriage return ('\\r'), or a carriage return followed immediately by a linefeed.\nQuestion: How can I write to a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.println.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.println\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(\"filename.txt\");\npw.println(\"Hello, World!\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The println() method of the PrintWriter class prints a line and then terminates the line. The string and arguments are converted to a string using the method String.valueOf(Object). The string and arguments are then encoded using the platform's default charset. The encoded bytes are written in exactly the manner of the write(int) method.\nQuestion: How can I close a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: FileInputStream.close.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileInputStream.close\n<<<code>>>: FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(\"filename.txt\");\nfis.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The close() method of the FileInputStream class closes the input stream and releases any system resources associated with the stream. Once the stream has been closed, further read() calls will throw a IOException.\nQuestion: How can I read a file line by line in Java?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"filename.txt\"));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The readLine() method of the BufferedReader class reads a line of text. A line is considered to be terminated by any one of a line feed ('\\n'), a carriage return ('\\r'), or a carriage return followed immediately by a linefeed.\n```\n\n## 3. Code:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Arrays;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\n        int sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n        System.out.println(\"Sum of array elements: \" + sum);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## 4. Explanation:\n\nThis Java program calculates the sum of an array using the `Arrays.stream` API.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. The `Arrays.stream(array)` method is used to convert the array into a stream. A stream in Java is a sequence of elements supporting sequential and parallel aggregate operations.\n\n2. The `sum()` method is then called on the stream. This method returns the sum of all elements in the stream.\n\n3. The sum is then printed to the console.\n\nThe output of this program will be:\n\n```\nSum of array elements: 15\n```\n\n## 5. Code:\n\n```java\nimport java.io.BufferedReader;\nimport java.io.FileReader;\nimport java.io.IOException;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"filename.txt\"))) {\n            String line;\n            while ((line ="}
