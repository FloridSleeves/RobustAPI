Improve this question                    We are using Access database for a project along with Java. We have some Macros in Access database and we need to run those from Java. Is there any way to execute those macros from Java?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(Runtime.getRuntime().exec(\"cmd.exe /c start msaccess.exe yourfile.accdb\").getOutputStream());\nout.write(\"yourmacroname\\n\");\nout.flush();\n<<<explanation>>>: The write() method of the PrintWriter class writes a single character. In this case, we are writing the name of the macro followed by a newline character to execute it. The flush() method is used to ensure that the written data is actually written out.\nQuestion: How to run Microsoft Access macro from Java:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Runtime.exec\n<<<code>>>: Runtime.getRuntime().exec(\"cmd.exe /c start msaccess.exe yourfile.accdb /x yourmacroname\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The exec() method of the Runtime class is used to run a command in the system's default shell.
