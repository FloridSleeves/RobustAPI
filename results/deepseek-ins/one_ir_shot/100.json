The write() method of the DataOutputStream class writes the specified bytes to the underlying output stream. This is a terminal operation.\n\n\nA: Here is how you can calculate the sum of an array using Java 8's Stream API:\n\n```java\nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n```\n\nIn this code, `Arrays.stream(array)` creates a Stream of integers from the array. The `sum()` method then calculates the sum of these integers.\n\nRegarding your TCP/IP related question, you can send a screenshot from a Java application to an Android application using TCP/IP as follows:\n\n```java\nDataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());\ndos.writeInt(buffer.length);\ndos.write(buffer, 0, buffer.length);\ndos.flush();\n```\n\nIn this code, `buffer` is the byte array representing the screenshot. The `writeInt()` method writes the length of the buffer to the output stream, and the `write()` method writes the actual bytes of the buffer to the output stream. The `flush()` method ensures that all data is sent immediately.\n\nPlease note that you need to handle the prefix length issue in the receiving side as well.\n\nAlso, remember to close the DataOutputStream and the socket when you're done with them to free up resources.\n\n```java\ndos.close();\nsocket.close();\n```\n\nThis should help you get started with your Java and Android applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
