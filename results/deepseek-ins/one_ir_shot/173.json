A line is considered to be terminated by any one of a line feed ('\\n'), a carriage return ('\\r'), or a carriage return followed immediately by a line feed.\nQuestion: What is the difference between the following two code snippets?\nSnippet 1:\nint[] array = new int[10];\nfor (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    array[i] = i * 2;\n}\n\nSnippet 2:\nint[] array = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18};\n\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Both\n<<<code>>>: \nint[] array1 = new int[10];\nfor (int i = 0; i < array1.length; i++) {\n    array1[i] = i * 2;\n}\n\nint[] array2 = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18};\n<<<explanation>>>: \nIn Snippet 1, we are creating an array of size 10 and then populating it with values of i*2.\nIn Snippet 2, we are directly initializing the array with specific values.\nQuestion: What is the purpose of the 'final' keyword in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: final\n<<<code>>>: final int x = 10;\n<<<explanation>>>: The 'final' keyword in Java is used to declare a constant. Once a variable is declared as final, its value cannot be changed. This is useful for declaring constants in Java.\nQuestion: What is the difference between the '==' and 'equals()' operators in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Both\n<<<code>>>: int a = 10;\nint b = 10;\nString s1 = new String(\"Hello\");\nString s2 = new String(\"Hello\");\nSystem.out.println(a == b); // prints true\nSystem.out.println(s1 == s2); // prints false\nSystem.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); // prints true\n<<<explanation>>>: \n'==' is a relational operator in Java used for checking if two variables point to the same location. It returns true if both variables point to the same location, else it returns false.\n'equals()' is a method in Java used for checking if two variables contain the same value. It returns true if the values are the same, else it returns false. The equals() method belongs to the Object class and is overridden in all classes.\nQuestion: What is the difference between a static method and a non-static method in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Both\n<<<code>>>: \npublic class MyClass {\n    static void myStaticMethod() {\n        System.out.println(\"Static method\");\n    }\n\n    void myNonStaticMethod() {\n        System.out.println(\"Non-static method\");\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        MyClass.myStaticMethod(); // Call static method\n        MyClass obj = new MyClass(); // Create an object of MyClass\n        obj.myNonStaticMethod(); // Call non-static method\n    }\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: \nA static method in Java belongs to the class itself rather than to any specific object of the class. It can be called without creating an object of the class. It can be accessed directly using the class name.\nA non-static method, on the other hand, belongs to an object of the class. It can only be called using an object of the class. The method can access and modify the non-static fields of the class.\nQuestion: What is the difference between '==' and 'equals()' in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Both\n<<<code>>>: \nint a = 10;\nint b = 10;\nString s1 = new String(\"Hello\");\nString s2 ="}
