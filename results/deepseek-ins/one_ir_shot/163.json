This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\n\n\nA: Here is how you can calculate the sum of an array in Java using Arrays.stream:\n\n```java\nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n```\n\nIn this code, `Arrays.stream(array)` creates a stream of integers from the array. The `sum()` method then calculates the sum of these integers. The result is stored in the `sum` variable.\n\nThis approach is more efficient and concise than using a traditional for loop or a for-each loop to calculate the sum of the array elements. It also takes advantage of Java's Stream API, which provides a more functional and expressive way to manipulate collections of data.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that you have imported the `java.util.Arrays` class in your Java code. If you haven't, you can add the following line at the beginning of your code:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Arrays;\n```\n\nThis line allows you to use the `Arrays.stream()` method without prefixing it with `java.util.Arrays.`.\n\nI hope this helps clarify how to calculate the sum of an array in Java using Arrays.stream.
