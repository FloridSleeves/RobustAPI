This method may be called repeatedly to iterate through the collection, or intermixed with add/remove operations to maintain the current iterator position.\nQuestion: What is the difference between synchronized and volatile in Java?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Both synchronized and volatile\n<<<code>>>: // synchronized keyword is used to make a method synchronized\npublic synchronized void method() {\n    // code\n}\n\n// volatile keyword is used to make a variable volatile\npublic volatile int variable;\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The synchronized keyword in Java is used to provide a high-level locking mechanism. It ensures that only one thread can enter the method at a time. This is useful when you want to prevent multiple threads from accessing a shared resource simultaneously.\nOn the other hand, the volatile keyword in Java is used to mark a Java variable as \"being stored in main memory\". It means that a variable's value will not be cached in CPU registers and it will be read from and written to main memory. This keyword is used in multithreaded environments to ensure that the value of a variable is not cached by the CPU and is always read from and written to main memory.\nQuestion: What is the difference between a static and non-static method in Java?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Both static and non-static methods\n<<<code>>>: // static method\npublic static void method() {\n    // code\n}\n\n// non-static method\npublic void nonStaticMethod() {\n    // code\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: In Java, a static method is associated with the class itself, rather than with any object of the class. This means you can call a static method without creating an object of the class. On the other hand, non-static methods are associated with objects of the class. You need to create an object to call a non-static method.\nQuestion: What is the difference between a static and non-static variable in Java?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Both static and non-static variables\n<<<code>>>: // static variable\npublic static int variable = 10;\n\n// non-static variable\npublic int nonStaticVariable = 20;\n\n<<<explanation>>>: A static variable is associated with the class itself, rather than with any object of the class. This means you can access a static variable without creating an object of the class. On the other hand, non-static variables are associated with objects of the class. You need to create an object to access a non-static variable.\nQuestion: What is the difference between a static and non-static block in Java?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Both static and non-static blocks\n<<<code>>>: // static block\nstatic {\n    // code\n}\n\n// non-static block\n{\n    // code\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: A static block is executed when the class is loaded into memory. It is used to initialize static variables. A static block is executed only once, at the time of class loading.\nOn the other hand, a non-static block (also known as an instance initializer block) is executed every time an object of the class is created. It is used to initialize non-static variables. A non-static block is executed every time an object of the class is created.\nQuestion: What is the difference between a static and non-static inner class in Java?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Both static and non-static inner classes\n<<<code>>>: // static inner class\npublic static class InnerClass {\n    // code\n}\n\n// non-static inner class\npublic class NonStaticInnerClass {\n    // code\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>: A static inner class is associated with the class itself, rather than with any object of the class. It can be accessed directly using the class name. On the other hand, a non-static inner class is associated with objects of the class. It can be accessed through an object of the class.\nQuestion: What is the difference between a static and non-static constructor in Java?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Both static and non-static constructors\n<<<code"}
