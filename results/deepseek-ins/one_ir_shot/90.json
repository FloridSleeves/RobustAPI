The writeBytes() method writes the specified String to the output stream. The write() method writes the specified byte to the output stream.\nQuestion: How can I read a file in Java?:\nPlease using this api: FileInputStream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileInputStream\n<<<code>>>: FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(\"file.txt\");\nbyte[] data = new byte[1024];\nint bytesRead;\nwhile((bytesRead = fis.read(data)) != -1) {\n    // process data\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The read() method of the FileInputStream class reads some number of bytes from the file into an array of bytes. It returns the total number of bytes read into the array. The read() method returns -1 if the end of the file is reached.\nQuestion: How can I write to a file in Java?:\nPlease using this api: FileOutputStream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileOutputStream\n<<<code>>>: FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(\"file.txt\");\nString text = \"Hello, World!\";\nbyte[] data = text.getBytes();\nfos.write(data);\nfos.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The write() method of the FileOutputStream class writes the specified byte to the file. The close() method of the FileOutputStream class closes this file output stream and releases any system resources associated with the stream.\nQuestion: How can I read a file line by line in Java?:\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"file.txt\"));\nString line;\nwhile((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    // process line\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The readLine() method of the BufferedReader class reads a line of text from the file. It returns null if the end of the file is reached.\nQuestion: How can I write to a file line by line in Java?:\nPlease using this api: BufferedWriter.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedWriter\n<<<code>>>: BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(\"file.txt\"));\nString line = \"Hello, World!\";\nbw.write(line);\nbw.newLine();\nbw.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The write() method of the BufferedWriter class writes the specified string to the file. The newLine() method of the BufferedWriter class writes a line separator. The close() method of the BufferedWriter class closes this file writer and releases any system resources associated with the stream.\nQuestion: How can I read a file line by line and process each line in parallel in Java?:\nPlease using this api: Files.lines.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.lines\n<<<code>>>: Files.lines(Paths.get(\"file.txt\")).parallel().forEach(line -> {\n    // process line\n});\n<<<explanation>>>: The lines() method of the Files class returns a Stream consisting of the lines of the file. The parallel() method of the Stream class returns a possibly parallel Stream that splits its source into multiple segments and processes them in parallel. The forEach() method of the Stream class performs an action for each element of this stream.\nQuestion: How can I write to a file line by line and process each line in parallel in Java?:\nPlease using this api: Files.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.write\n<<<code>>>: List<String> lines = Arrays.asList(\"Hello, World!\");\nFiles.write(Paths.get(\"file.txt\"), lines, StandardOpenOption.CREATE, StandardOpenOption.APPEND);\n<<<explanation>>>: The write() method of the Files class writes the specified lines to the file. The CREATE option creates the file if it"}
