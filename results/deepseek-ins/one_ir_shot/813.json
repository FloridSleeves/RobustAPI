The BufferedReader is used to read the error output line by line.\n\n\nA: Here is a simple way to calculate the sum of an array using Java 8's Stream API:\n\n```java\nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\nSystem.out.println(sum);  // Output: 15\n```\n\nIn this code, `Arrays.stream(array)` creates a Stream of integers from the array. The `sum()` method then calculates the sum of all the integers in the Stream.\n\nAs for sending commands to a console application, you can use a `BufferedWriter` to write the commands to the process's output stream. Here's an example:\n\n```java\nProcess process = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(\"your_command\");\nBufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(process.getOutputStream()));\nwriter.write(\"your_command_argument\");\nwriter.flush();\n```\n\nIn this code, `Runtime.getRuntime().exec(\"your_command\")` starts the process. `process.getOutputStream()` gets the output stream of the process, which you can write to send commands to the process. The `BufferedWriter` writes the commands to the output stream.\n\nTo handle the output of a process in Java, you can use `InputStream` to read the output of the process. Here's an example:\n\n```java\nInputStream input = process.getInputStream();\nBufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(input));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, `process.getInputStream()` gets the input stream of the process, which you can read to get the output of the process. The `BufferedReader` reads the output line by line, and you can print each line to handle the output.\n\nTo handle the error output of a process in Java, you can use `InputStream` to read the error output of the process. Here's an example:\n\n```java\nInputStream error = process.getErrorStream();\nBufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(error));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, `process.getErrorStream()` gets the error output stream of the process, which you can read to get the error output of the process. The `BufferedReader` reads the error output line by line, and you can print each line to handle the error output.\n\nPlease replace `\"your_command\"` and `\"your_command_argument\""}
