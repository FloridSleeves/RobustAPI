If the file doesn't exists, I want to create the file and then add the data.Adding data works fine. But appending data overwrites existing data.

Thank you!\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(new FileOutputStream(new File(savestr), true));\nout.write(mapstring);\nout.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The write(int c) method of the PrintWriter class writes a single character. The character to be written is given as an integer. This method is overridden by any filter output stream. This method does not automatically flush the stream after writing the character.\nQuestion: How to create a new line in a text file using Java?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.println.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.println\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(savestr, \"UTF-8\");\nout.println();\nout.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The println() method of the PrintWriter class prints a line separator. The line separator string is defined by the system property line.separator property. This method is overridden by any filter output stream. This method always flushes the stream after writing the line separator.\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"filename.txt\"));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\nbr.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The readLine() method of the BufferedReader class reads a line of text. A line is considered to be terminated by any one of a line feed ('\\n'), a carriage return ('\\r'), or a carriage return followed immediately by a line feed.\nQuestion: How to write to a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.println.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.println\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(\"filename.txt\", \"UTF-8\");\nout.println(\"Hello, World!\");\nout.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The println() method of the PrintWriter class prints a line and then terminates the line. The line terminator string is defined by the system property line.separator property. This method is overridden by any filter output stream. This method always flushes the stream after writing the line.\nQuestion: How to read a file line by line in Java?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"filename.txt\"));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\nbr.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The readLine() method of the BufferedReader class reads a line of text. A line is considered to be terminated by any one of a line feed ('\\n'), a carriage return ('\\r'), or a carriage return followed immediately by a line feed.\nQuestion: How to write to a file line by line in Java?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.println.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.println\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(\"filename.txt\", \"UTF-8\");\nout.println(\"First line\");\nout.println(\"Second line\");\nout.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The println() method of the PrintWriter class prints a line and then terminates the line. The line terminator string is defined by the system property line.separator property. This method is overridden by any filter output stream. This method always flushes the stream after writing the line.\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java using a specific encoding?\nPlease using this api: Files.readAllLines.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.readAllLines\n<<<code>>>: List<String> lines = Files.readAllLines(Paths.get(\"filename.txt\"), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);\nfor (String line : lines) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The readAllLines() method of the Files class returns a list containing all lines of the specified"}
