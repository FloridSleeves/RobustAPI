This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to convert a string to an integer in Java?\nPlease using this api: Integer.parseInt.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Integer.parseInt\n<<<code>>>: String str = \"123\";\nint num = Integer.parseInt(str);\n<<<explanation>>>: The parseInt() method of the Integer class parses the string argument as a signed decimal integer. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to convert an integer to a string in Java?\nPlease using this api: Integer.toString.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Integer.toString\n<<<code>>>: int num = 123;\nString str = Integer.toString(num);\n<<<explanation>>>: The toString() method of the Integer class returns a String object representing the specified integer. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"file.txt\"));\nString line = reader.readLine();\nwhile (line != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n    line = reader.readLine();\n}\nreader.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The readLine() method of the BufferedReader class reads a line of text from the input stream. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to write to a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.println.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.println\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"file.txt\", \"UTF-8\");\nwriter.println(\"Hello, World!\");\nwriter.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The println() method of the PrintWriter class writes a line of text to the output stream. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to handle exceptions in Java?\nPlease using this api: try-catch-finally.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: try-catch-finally\n<<<code>>>: try {\n    // code that may throw an exception\n} catch (ExceptionType name) {\n    // code to handle the exception\n} finally {\n    // code to be executed regardless of whether an exception occurred\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The try-catch-finally block in Java is used to handle exceptions. The try block contains the code that may throw an exception. The catch block contains the code to handle the exception. The finally block contains the code to be executed regardless of whether an exception occurred.\n\n\nA: Here is the answer to your question:\n\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.
