It is a part of Java's Collection Framework. It represents a data structure that can contain duplicate elements. It is an ordered collection where elements maintain their insertion order. ArrayList is a class that implements List interface. It is a resizable array.\nQuestion: How to create a new instance of a class in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: new keyword\n<<<code>>>: MyClass obj = new MyClass();\n<<<explanation>>>: The new keyword in Java is used to create a new instance of a class. It allocates memory for a new object and invokes the class's constructor.\nQuestion: How to create a new thread in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Thread class\n<<<code>>>: \nThread thread = new Thread(new Runnable() {\n    public void run() {\n        // code to be executed in new thread\n    }\n});\nthread.start();\n<<<explanation>>>: The Thread class in Java is used to create a new thread. The Runnable interface is used to create a task that can be executed concurrently. The start() method is used to start the execution of the thread.\nQuestion: How to handle a checked exception in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: try-catch block\n<<<code>>>: \ntry {\n    // code that may throw checked exception\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    // handle the exception\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: Checked exceptions are checked at compile time. They must be either caught or declared in the method where they are thrown.\nQuestion: How to create a new instance of an interface in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: You cannot create a new instance of an interface in Java. An interface is a reference type in Java, similar to a class, that can't be instantiated.\n<<<code>>>: // This will not compile\n// MyInterface obj = new MyInterface();\n<<<explanation>>>: Interfaces in Java are used to achieve full abstraction and multiple inheritance. They can't be instantiated because they don't have any implementation.\nQuestion: How to create a new instance of an abstract class in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: new keyword\n<<<code>>>: AbstractClass obj = new AbstractClass() {\n    // provide implementation for abstract methods\n};\n<<<explanation>>>: Abstract classes in Java can't be instantiated. They are used to provide a base for subclasses. You can create a new instance of an abstract class by creating a subclass and instantiating that subclass.\nQuestion: How to create a new instance of an enum in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Enum values are created by calling the constructor of the enum type.\n<<<code>>>: MyEnum obj = MyEnum.VALUE;\n<<<explanation>>>: Enum in Java is a special data type that enables for a variable to be a set of predefined constants. The variable must be equal to one of the predefined constants.\nQuestion: How to create a new instance of a primitive type in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Primitive types in Java are not objects and do not need to be instantiated.\n<<<code>>>: int i = 10;\n<<<explanation>>>: Primitive types in Java are int, float, double, char, boolean, byte, short, and long. They are"}
