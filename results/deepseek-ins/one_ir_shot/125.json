Performance wise the code wasn't too bad, I think replace was the heaviest part of the code(if I remember it was like 15% of overall execution).I asked around and found Gson to be able to do this cleaner but the performance is now over 40% of my loop now(its Gson itself thats doing it):    Gson gson = new Gson();    int[] sub = { 0, 59, 16 };    Object[] values = { 0, 43.0, sub };    String output = gson.toJson(values); // => [0, 43.0,[0,59,16]]    Object[] deserialized = gson.fromJson(output, Object[].class);    System.out.println(deserialized[0]);    System.out.println(deserialized[1]);    System.out.println(deserialized[2]);So I'm wondering if there's faster way to get the same result?I am trying out a few of the suggestions in this question but is there a faster way to do this without depending on any external libraries as my needs are quite simple(if not, then is there a fast one)?

This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I convert an array of bytes to a string in Java?\nPlease using this api: new String(byte[], charset).\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: new String(byte[], charset)\n<<<code>>>: byte[] byteArray = { 97, 98, 99 };\nString str = new String(byteArray, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);\n<<<explanation>>>: The String(byte[], Charset) constructor creates a new String by decoding the specified array of bytes using the named charset. The length of the new String is a function of the charset, the byte array, and the charset's decoder. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I convert a string to an array of bytes in Java?\nPlease using this api: string.getBytes(charset).\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: string.getBytes(charset)\n<<<code>>>: String str = \"abc\";\nbyte[] byteArray = str.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8);\n<<<explanation>>>: The getBytes() method encodes the string into a sequence of bytes using the named charset, storing the result into a new byte array.

This is a terminal operation.\n\n\nA: The fastest way to convert data to a byte and then back into its original form in Java is to use the ByteBuffer class. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Convert data to byte array:\n\n```java\nByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(100); // Allocate 100 bytes\nbuffer.putInt(123); // Put an integer\nbuffer.putDouble(456.789); // Put a double\nbuffer.putInt(789); // Put another integer\nbyte[] byteArray = buffer.array(); // Get the byte array\n```\n\n2. Convert byte array back to original data:\n\n```java\nByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.wrap(byteArray); // Wrap the byte array\nint number = buffer.getInt(); // Get the integer\ndouble decimal = buffer.getDouble(); // Get the double\nint anotherNumber = buffer.getInt(); // Get the integer\n```\n\nThis method is faster than using Gson or other libraries because it directly manipulates the byte array, which is more efficient.\n\nNote: The ByteBuffer class is part of the Java standard library, so you don't need any external libraries to use it.\n\nAlso, if you're working with arrays of primitives (like int[] or double[]), you can use the ByteBuffer's put and get methods for each primitive type (putInt, putDouble, getInt, etc.).\n\nIf you're working with arrays of objects, you can use the ByteBuffer's putObject and getObject methods. However, keep in mind that these methods require the objects to implement the Serializable interface and the classes of the objects to be available on"}
