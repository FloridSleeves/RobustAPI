The number of bytes read is returned. This method blocks until some input is available. If the end of the stream is reached, the -1 is returned. The read method of InputStream class is used to read bytes from the stream.\nQuestion: How to convert a string to a byte array in java?\nPlease using this api: getBytes().\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: getBytes()\n<<<code>>>: String str = \"Hello, World!\";\nbyte[] bytes = str.getBytes();\n<<<explanation>>>: The getBytes() method of the String class returns a sequence of bytes that represent the string. The encoding used is platform dependent. The length of the returned array will be the same as the length of this string.\nQuestion: How to convert a byte array to a string in java?\nPlease using this api: new String().\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: new String()\n<<<code>>>: byte[] bytes = {72, 101, 108, 108, 111, 44, 32, 87, 111, 114, 108, 100, 33};\nString str = new String(bytes);\n<<<explanation>>>: The new String() constructor of the String class creates a new String by decoding the specified array of bytes using the platform's default charset. The length of the new String is the same as the length of the byte array.\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n"}
