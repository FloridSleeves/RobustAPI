This method may throw a NoSuchElementException if there are no more elements in the iteration.\nQuestion: What is the difference between a List and an ArrayList in Java?\nPlease using this api: ArrayList.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: ArrayList\n<<<code>>>: List<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();\n<<<explanation>>>: A List in Java is an ordered collection of objects. It allows duplicate elements. It is an interface and it is a part of Java Collections Framework. ArrayList is a class that implements List interface. It maintains the insertion order and permits null elements.\nQuestion: How to create a new instance of a class in Java?\nPlease using this api: new keyword.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: new keyword\n<<<code>>>: MyClass myClass = new MyClass();\n<<<explanation>>>: The 'new' keyword is used to create a new instance of a class in Java. It allocates memory for a new object and invokes the class's constructor.\nQuestion: What is the difference between '==' and 'equals' in Java?\nPlease using this api: equals method.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: equals method\n<<<code>>>: String str1 = new String(\"Hello\");\nString str2 = new String(\"Hello\");\nboolean equalOutput = str1 == str2; // false\nboolean equalOutput = str1.equals(str2); // true\n<<<explanation>>>: '==' is a comparison operator in Java, which checks if the two references point to the same location. 'equals()' is a method in Java, which checks if the two objects are equal.\n\n\nA: Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.
