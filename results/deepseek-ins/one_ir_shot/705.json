This is a terminal operation. It returns null if the end of the stream has been reached.\n\nA: Here is how you can calculate the sum of an array using Java 8's Stream API:\n\n```java\nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n```\n\nThis code creates a stream from the array, then calls the sum() method on the stream to calculate the sum.\n\nFor your second question, you can read a specified string from an input file and read the next word after it like this:\n\n```java\nBufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"accounts.txt\"));\nString line = br.readLine();\nwhile (line != null) {\n    if (line.startsWith(\"usrnm:\")) {\n        String user = line.substring(line.indexOf(\":\") + 1);\n        System.out.println(\"Username: \" + user);\n    } else if (line.startsWith(\"pswrd:\")) {\n        String password = line.substring(line.indexOf(\":\") + 1);\n        System.out.println(\"Password: \" + password);\n    }\n    line = br.readLine();\n}\nbr.close();\n```\n\nThis code reads each line from the file until it reaches the end. If a line starts with \"usrnm:\", it extracts the username by finding the index of the colon and taking the substring after it. If a line starts with \"pswrd:\", it does the same to extract the password.\n\nFor your third question, you can write a specified string to an output file like this:\n\n```java\nPrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"accounts.txt\", \"UTF-8\");\nwriter.write(\"usrnm: \" + userInput + \"\\n\");\nwriter.write(\"pswrd: \" + passwordInput + \"\\n\");\nwriter.close();\n```\n\nThis code creates a new PrintWriter for the file \"accounts.txt\". It then writes the username and password to the file, followed by a newline character. The close() method is called to ensure that all data is written to the file.\n\nI hope this helps you understand how to use the APIs you mentioned in Java.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
