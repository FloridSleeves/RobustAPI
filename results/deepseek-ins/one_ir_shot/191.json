The number of bytes read is returned. This method returns -1 if the end of the stream has been reached.\nQuestion: How can I sort a list of objects in Java?\nPlease using this api: Collections.sort.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Collections.sort\n<<<code>>>: List<MyObject> list = new ArrayList<>();\nCollections.sort(list, Comparator.comparing(MyObject::getMyProperty));\n<<<explanation>>>: The sort() method of the Collections class sorts the specified list into ascending order, according to the natural ordering of its elements. The sort is not stable, i.e., equal elements may not preserve their relative order.\nQuestion: How can I find the maximum value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint max = Arrays.stream(array).max().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The max() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalInt that represents the maximum element of this stream. If the stream is empty, the result is an empty Optional. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the minimum value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint min = Arrays.stream(array).min().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The min() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalInt that represents the minimum element of this stream. If the stream is empty, the result is an empty Optional. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the average of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\ndouble average = Arrays.stream(array).average().getAsDouble();\n<<<explanation>>>: The average() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalDouble that represents the arithmetic average of the numbers in the stream. If the stream is empty, the result is an empty Optional. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\n\n\nA: Here are the answers to your questions:\n\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nAnswer: Arrays.stream\nCode:\nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n\nExplanation: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\n\nQuestion: org.apache.commons.fileupload.disk.DiskFileItem is not created properly?\nAnswer: InputStream.read\nCode:\nInputStream inputStream = diskFileItem.getInputStream();\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\nint bytesRead;\nwhile ((bytesRead = inputStream.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n    System.out.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);\n}\n\nExplanation: The read() method of the InputStream class reads some number of bytes from the input stream and stores them into the buffer array b. The number of bytes read is returned. This method returns -1 if the end of the stream has been reached.\n\nQuestion: How can I sort a list of objects in Java?\nAnswer: Collections.sort\nCode:\nList<MyObject> list = new ArrayList<>"}
