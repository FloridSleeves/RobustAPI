Any help would be appreciated!\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: int read = inputStream.read(buffer);\n<<<explanation>>>: The read() method of the InputStream class reads some number of bytes from the input stream and stores them into the buffer array b. The number of bytes read is returned as an integer. If there are no bytes to read, -1 is returned.\nQuestion: How can I read a file in Java?:\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: String line;\nwhile ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The readLine() method of the BufferedReader class reads a line of text. A line is considered to be terminated by any one of a line feed ('\\n'), a carriage return ('\\r'), or a carriage return followed immediately by a linefeed.\nQuestion: How can I read a file in Java?:\nPlease using this api: FileInputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileInputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(\"file.txt\");\nint data = fis.read();\n<<<explanation>>>: The read() method of the FileInputStream class reads the next byte of data from the input stream. The value byte is returned as an int in the range 0 to 255. If no byte is available because the end of the stream has been reached, the value -1 is returned.\nQuestion: How can I read a file in Java?:\nPlease using this api: FileReader.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileReader.read\n<<<code>>>: FileReader reader = new FileReader(\"file.txt\");\nint data = reader.read();\n<<<explanation>>>: The read() method of the FileReader class reads a single character. It returns the character read, or -1 if the end of the file is reached.\nQuestion: How can I read a file in Java?:\nPlease using this api: Scanner.nextLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Scanner.nextLine\n<<<code>>>: Scanner scanner = new Scanner(new File(\"file.txt\"));\nString line = scanner.nextLine();\n<<<explanation>>>: The nextLine() method of the Scanner class is used to get the next line of the input as a string. It returns the rest of the current line, excluding any line separator at the end. The position is set to the beginning of the next line.\n```\n\n## Answer:\n```\nQuestion: How can I read a file in Java?:\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: String line;\nwhile ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The readLine() method of the BufferedReader class reads a line of text.
