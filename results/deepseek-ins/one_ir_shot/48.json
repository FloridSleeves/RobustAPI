This is a terminal operation. The returned Drawable can be used to display the icon in an ImageView.\nQuestion: How to get the list of all installed applications in Android?\nPlease using this api: PackageManager.getInstalledApplications.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PackageManager.getInstalledApplications\n<<<code>>>: List<ApplicationInfo> apps = getPackageManager().getInstalledApplications(PackageManager.GET_META_DATA);\n<<<explanation>>>: Returns a list of all applications which are currently installed on the device. This is a terminal operation. The returned list contains ApplicationInfo objects for all packages that are currently installed on the device.\nQuestion: How can I sort an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.sort.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.sort\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {5, 2, 8, 6, 1};\nArrays.sort(array);\n<<<explanation>>>: Sorts the specified array of objects into ascending numerical order. This is a terminal operation. The sort is not stable.\nQuestion: How can I find the maximum value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint max = Arrays.stream(array).max().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The max() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalInt that represents the maximum element of this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the minimum value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint min = Arrays.stream(array).min().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The min() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalInt that represents the minimum element of this stream. This is a special case of a reduction.
