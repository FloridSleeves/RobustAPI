Here is an example:\n\n```python\narray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\ntotal = sum(array)\n```\n\nIn this example, the sum() function takes an iterable (in this case, the array) and returns the sum of its elements.\n```\n\n```java\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nAnswer: In Java, you can calculate the sum of an array using the Stream API. Here is an example:\n\n```java\nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n```\n\nIn this example, the sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.
