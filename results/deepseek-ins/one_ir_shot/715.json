I already have a .txt file that contains different songs which is stored into an array list. After the user finishes adding or deleting songs the program should write to the text file in the original format of the text file (comma separated).My problem is that the program writes to the file without the commas and it is causing my program to crash when I re-run it by getting an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. I have attempted to use nested for-loops and the printf function but have had no success. How can i write to the file with its original formatting and avoid crashing after i write to it and attempt to run it again?This is the format of the .txt FileRock Lobster,The B-52's,The B-52's,4:37Walk Like An Egyptian,The Bangles,Different Light,3:24This is my Song Class with toString() methodpublic class Song {    //Declaring all data members.    private String title;    private String artist;    private String album;    private String length;    private static int songCounter = 0;    //Constructors for Song class.          public Song(String title, String artist, String album, String length){        this.title = title;        this.artist = artist;        this.album = album;        this.length = length;        songCounter++;    }    //Get and Set methods     public String getTitle(){        return title;    }    public void setTitle(String title) {        this.title = title;    }    public String getArtist(){        return artist;    }    public void setArtist(String artist) {        this.artist = artist;    }    public String getAlbum(){        return album;    }    public void setAlbum(String album){        this.album = album;    }    public String getLength(){        return length;    }    public void setLength(String length){        this.length = length;    }    public static int getSongCounter(){        return songCounter;    }    public int compareArtist(Song o){        return artist.compareTo(o.artist);    }    public int compareTitle(Song o){        return title.compareTo(o.title);    }    //Overriding the toString() function.    @Override    public String toString(){        return title +\",\"+artist+\",\"+album+\",\"+length;    }}      This is my Main Class that reads from the file and contains a write methodpublic class Library {public static void main(String[] args) {    ArrayList <Song> songList = new ArrayList <Song> ();    boolean repeat = true;    try{        Scanner read = new Scanner (new File(\"SongList.txt\"));        do{            String line = read.nextLine();            String [] tokens = line.split(\",\");            songList.add(new Song(tokens[0], tokens[1], tokens[2], tokens[3]));        }while(read.hasNext());        read.close();    }catch (FileNotFoundException e){        System.out.println(\"File not found.\");    }    while ( repeat ){        System.out.println(\"\\nSelect a Function\");        System.out.println(\"1.

The string is followed by a line separator. This is a convenience method that calls the write(String) and write(char) methods.\nQuestion: How can I sort an ArrayList of custom objects in Java?\nPlease using this api: Collections.sort.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Collections.sort\n<<<code>>>: Collections.sort(songList, new Comparator<Song>() {\n    @Override\n    public int compare(Song s1, Song s2) {\n        return s1.compareTitle(s2);\n    }\n});\n<<<explanation>>>: The sort() method of the Collections class sorts the specified list into ascending order, according to the natural ordering of its elements. This is a stable, adaptive, iterative sorting algorithm that has an average and worst-case performance of O(n log n). The Comparator is used to determine the order of the objects in the list.\nQuestion: How can I read a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: Scanner.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Scanner\n<<<code>>>: Scanner scanner = new Scanner(new File(\"file.txt\"));\nwhile (scanner.hasNextLine()) {\n    String line = scanner.nextLine();\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\nscanner.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The Scanner class is used to parse the content from the file. The hasNextLine() method checks if there is another line in the file. The nextLine() method reads the next line from the file. The close() method is used to close the scanner.\nQuestion: How can I write to a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"file.txt\", \"UTF-8\");\nwriter.println(\"Hello, World!\");\nwriter.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The PrintWriter class is used to write text to a file. The println() method writes a line to the file. The close() method is used to close the writer. The second argument to the PrintWriter constructor is the character set to use.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\n```\n\n## 2. \uc815\ub2f5 \ud655\uc778\n\n```python\ndef check_answers(questions):\n    correct = 0\n    for question in questions:\n        api = question['api']\n        code = question['code']\n        explanation = question['explanation']\n        if api == 'Arrays.stream':\n            array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n            sum_ = sum(array)\n            if code == 'int sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();':\n                correct += 1\n        elif api == 'PrintWriter.write':\n            writer = PrintWriter(\"file.txt\", \"UTF-8\")\n            writer.write(\"Hello, World!\\n\")\n            writer.close()\n            with open(\"file.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n                content = file.read()\n            if code == 'PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"file.txt\", \"UTF-8\");\\nwriter.write(\"Hello, World!\\n\");\\nwriter.close();':\n                correct += 1\n        elif api == 'Collections.sort':\n            class Song:\n                def __init__(self, title):\n                    self.title = title\n                def compareTitle(self, other):\n                    return self."}
