If no byte is available, it blocks until one is available. The return value is the byte read, or -1 if the end of the stream is reached.\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java?:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileInputStream\n<<<code>>>: FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(\"file.txt\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The FileInputStream class is used to read data from a file. It is part of the Java I/O package and is used to read bytes from a file.\nQuestion: How to write to a file in Java?:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileOutputStream\n<<<code>>>: FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(\"file.txt\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The FileOutputStream class is used to write data to a file. It is part of the Java I/O package and is used to write bytes to a file.\nQuestion: How to read a file line by line in Java?:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"file.txt\"));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The readLine() method of the BufferedReader class is used to read a line of text. It returns null when there is no more data to read.\nQuestion: How to write to a file line by line in Java?:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.println\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(\"file.txt\");\npw.println(\"Hello, World!\");\npw.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The println() method of the PrintWriter class is used to write a line of text to the file. It automatically adds a newline character at the end of the line.\nQuestion: How to handle exceptions in Java?:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: try-catch-finally\n<<<code>>>: \ntry {\n    // code that may throw an exception\n} catch (ExceptionType name) {\n    // code to handle the exception\n} finally {\n    // code to be executed regardless of whether an exception was thrown\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The try-catch-finally block is used to handle exceptions in Java. The try block contains the code that may throw an exception, the catch block contains the code to handle the exception, and the finally block contains the code to be executed regardless of whether an exception was thrown.\nQuestion: What is the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions in Java?:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Checked vs Unchecked Exceptions\n<<<code>>>: Checked exceptions are checked at compile time, while unchecked exceptions are not.\n<<<explanation>>>: Checked exceptions are exceptions that are checked at compile time, meaning that the compiler will check to ensure that the exception is handled before the method returns. Unchecked exceptions, on the other hand, are not checked at compile time, but are checked at runtime.\nQuestion: What is the difference between == and equals() in Java?:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: == vs equals()\n<<<code>>>: int a = 1;\nint b = 1;\nString s1 = new String(\"Hello\");\nString s2 = new String(\"Hello\");\nSystem.out.println(a == b); // true\nSystem.out.println(s1 == s2); // false\nSystem.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); // true\n<<<explanation>>>: The == operator compares the references of the objects, not their content. The equals() method, on the other hand, compares the content of the objects.\nQuestion: What is the difference between final, finally, and finalize in Java?:\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: final, finally, finalize\n<<<code>>>: \nfinal: A final variable cannot be changed once it is assigned.\nfinally: The finally block always executes whether an exception is thrown or not.\nfinalize: The finalize() method in Java is a method that is used to clean up any resources that are being used by an object. It is called by"}
