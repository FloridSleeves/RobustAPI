In this case, we are using it to delay the visibility of the images. The first image is visible, then after half a second it is invisible and the second image is visible, and so on. After the third image is invisible, the first image is visible again. This continues in a loop.\n\n\nA: Here is a simple way to calculate the sum of an array using Java 8's Stream API:\n\n```java\nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n```\n\nThis code creates a stream of integers from the array, then uses the sum() method to calculate the sum of these integers.\n\nFor your second question, you can use a Timer to create an animation that cycles through your images. Here is a simple example:\n\n```java\nfinal ImageView img1 = findViewById(R.id.img1);\nfinal ImageView img2 = findViewById(R.id.img2);\nfinal ImageView img3 = findViewById(R.id.img3);\n\nTimer timer = new Timer();\ntimer.schedule(new TimerTask() {\n    int currentImage = 0;\n\n    @Override\n    public void run() {\n        img1.setVisibility(currentImage == 0 ? View.VISIBLE : View.INVISIBLE);\n        img2.setVisibility(currentImage == 1 ? View.VISIBLE : View.INVISIBLE);\n        img3.setVisibility(currentImage == 2 ? View.VISIBLE : View.INVISIBLE);\n\n        currentImage = (currentImage + 1) % 3;\n    }\n}, 0, 500);\n```\n\nThis code creates a Timer that runs every 500 milliseconds (half a second). The TimerTask switches the visibility of the images and cycles through them. The images are initially all invisible except for the first one. After half a second, the first image is invisible and the second image is visible, and so on. After the third image is invisible and the first image is visible again. This continues in a loop.\n\nPlease note that this is a simple example and may not cover all edge cases. For a more robust solution, you might want to consider using a ViewPager or a similar library.\n\nAlso, remember to replace `R.id.img1`, `R.id.img2`, and `R.id.img3` with the actual IDs of your ImageViews in your layout file.\n\nI hope this helps, and let me know if you have any other questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
