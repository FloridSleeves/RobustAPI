This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the minimum value in a list of integers in Java 8?\nPlease using this api: Stream.min.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Stream.min\n<<<code>>>: List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);\nOptional<Integer> min = list.stream().min(Integer::min);\n<<<explanation>>>: The min() method of the Stream interface returns an Optional describing the minimum element of this stream according to the provided Comparator.

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the sum of squares of a list of integers in Java 8?\nPlease using this api: Stream.mapToInt.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Stream.mapToInt\n<<<code>>>: List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);\nint sumOfSquares = list.stream().mapToInt(i -> i * i).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the product of a list of integers in Java 8?\nPlease using this api: Stream.reduce.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Stream.reduce\n<<<code>>>: List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);\nOptional<Integer> product = list.stream().reduce((a, b) -> a * b);\n<<<explanation>>>: The reduce() method of the Stream interface performs a reduction on the elements of this stream, using the provided identity and an associative binary operator. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the number of elements in a list in Java 8?\nPlease using this api: Stream.count.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Stream.count\n<<<code>>>: List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);\nlong count = list.stream().count();\n<<<explanation>>>: The count() method of the Stream interface returns the count of elements in this stream.
