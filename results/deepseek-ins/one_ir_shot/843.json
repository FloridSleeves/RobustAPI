However, since it takes around 3 seconds to complete, i don't just want the screen sitting and waiting for 3 seconds showing nothing. I would like it to display a ProgressDialog. I've tried everything in these threads and while most do 2 / 3, none seem to do all 3.Basically I have a button that when pressed, i want to parse the xml file and then use the data parsed from the file:void onButtonClicked() {    ProgressDialog pd = new ProgressDialog(this);    pd.setMessage(\"Parsing...\");    pd.show();    String[] ret;    return = parseXmlFile();    pd.dismiss();    if (ret[0] == \"steve\") {       sayHiToSteve();    }}  If I use an asyncTask, it will continue on with execution and check ret[0] before the task is completed and will just be null.if i do AsyncTask.get(), it pauses the execution but doesn't display the progress dialog, so that's no good either. I also looked at creating a seperate thread, but i had the same problem. I can't use a timer, because it is about 3 seconds (but can be up to 4 or 5 seconds if connection is slow), so i can't approximate. Any help is much appreciated.Thanks in advance.\nPlease using this api: ProgressDialog.dismiss.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.

An AsyncTask is a class that helps you perform background operations and then update the UI when the operations are complete. Here is an example of how you can use AsyncTask to parse an XML file while pausing the main execution but not the UI:\n\n```java\nprivate class ParseXmlTask extends AsyncTask<Void, Void, String[]> {\n    ProgressDialog pd;\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onPreExecute() {\n        pd = new ProgressDialog(YourActivity.this);\n        pd.setMessage(\"Parsing...\");\n        pd.show();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected String[] doInBackground(Void... params) {\n        return parseXmlFile();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onPostExecute(String[] result) {\n        pd.dismiss();\n        if (result[0].equals(\"steve\")) {\n            sayHiToSteve();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nvoid onButtonClicked() {\n    new ParseXmlTask().execute();\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `ParseXmlTask` class extends `AsyncTask` and overrides the `onPreExecute`, `doInBackground`, and `onPostExecute` methods. The `onPreExecute` method is called on the UI thread before the task is executed. It is where you create and show the ProgressDialog. The `doInBackground` method is called on a background thread and is where you perform the XML parsing. The `onPostExecute` method is called on the UI thread after the background task is completed. It is where you dismiss the ProgressDialog and perform any necessary UI updates based on the result of the XML parsing. The `execute` method of the `AsyncTask` is called from the `onButtonClicked` method to start the background task.\n\nThis way, the XML parsing will be performed in the background, while the ProgressDialog will be displayed on the UI thread, preventing the main execution from being paused.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
