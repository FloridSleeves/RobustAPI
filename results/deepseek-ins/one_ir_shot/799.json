The print() method prints a string and then terminate the line. The flush() method of the PrintWriter class forces any buffered output bytes to be written out.\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.readAllLines.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Files.readAllLines\n<<<code>>>: List<String> lines = Files.readAllLines(Paths.get(\"file.txt\"), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);\nfor (String line : lines) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The readAllLines() method of the Files class returns a list containing all lines of the specified file. The lines are read using the UTF-8 charset.\nQuestion: How to write to a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.write.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Files.write\n<<<code>>>: List<String> lines = Arrays.asList(\"line1\", \"line2\", \"line3\");\nFiles.write(Paths.get(\"file.txt\"), lines, StandardOpenOption.CREATE);\n<<<explanation>>>: The write() method of the Files class writes the specified lines to the specified file. If the file does not exist, it is created.\nQuestion: How to create a directory in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.createDirectories.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Files.createDirectories\n<<<code>>>: Files.createDirectories(Paths.get(\"directory\"));\n<<<explanation>>>: The createDirectories() method of the Files class creates a new directory and its parents if they do not already exist.\nQuestion: How to list files in a directory in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.list.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Files.list\n<<<code>>>: Files.list(Paths.get(\"directory\")).forEach(file -> System.out.println(file.getFileName()));\n<<<explanation>>>: The list() method of the Files class returns a stream of the files in the specified directory. The getFileName() method of the Path class returns the name of this path.\nQuestion: How to delete a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.delete.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Files.delete\n<<<code>>>: Files.delete(Paths.get(\"file.txt\"));\n<<<explanation>>>: The delete() method of the Files class deletes the file denoted by this path. If the file does not exist, then the method does nothing and the method returns false.\nQuestion: How to rename a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.move.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Files.move\n<<<code>>>: Files.move(Paths.get(\"old.txt\"), Paths.get(\"new.txt\"), StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING);\n<<<explanation>>>: The move() method of the Files class moves the file denoted by this path to the file denoted by the destination path. If the destination file exists, it will be replaced.\nQuestion: How to copy a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.copy.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Files.copy\n<<<code>>>: Files.copy(Paths.get(\"source.txt\"), Paths.get(\"destination.txt\"), StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING);\n<<<explanation>>>: The copy() method of the Files class copies the file denoted by this path to the file denoted by the destination path. If the destination file exists, it will be replaced.\n\n\nA: Here is the answer to your question:\n\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\n\nAnswer:\n<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: \nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class"}
