Questions, Is there a known way to communicate base64 between a Java encoding and Node Js decoding?Are there other recommendation on base64 encoding in Pentaho?\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: String.getBytes\n<<<code>>>: String base64 = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(fileContent);\n<<<explanation>>>: The encodeToString() method of the Base64.Encoder class returns a String that represents the Base64 encoded byte array.\nQuestion: How can I convert a string to a byte array in Java?\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: String.getBytes\n<<<code>>>: byte[] byteArray = \"Hello, World!\".getBytes();\n<<<explanation>>>: The getBytes() method of the String class returns an array of bytes representing the characters in the string.\nQuestion: How can I convert a byte array to a string in Java?\nPlease using this api: new String.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: new String\n<<<code>>>: String str = new String(byteArray);\n<<<explanation>>>: The String(byte[] bytes) constructor of the String class creates a new String by decoding the specified array of bytes using the platform's default charset.\nQuestion: How can I read a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.readAllBytes.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.readAllBytes\n<<<code>>>: byte[] data = Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get(\"file.txt\"));\n<<<explanation>>>: The readAllBytes method of the Files class returns a byte array containing the contents of the file.\nQuestion: How can I write a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.write\n<<<code>>>: Files.write(Paths.get(\"file.txt\"), \"Hello, World!\".getBytes());\n<<<explanation>>>: The write method of the Files class writes bytes to a file. If the file does not exist, it is created. If it does exist, it is truncated to zero size.\nQuestion: How can I read a file line by line in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.lines.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.lines\n<<<code>>>: Files.lines(Paths.get(\"file.txt\")).forEach(line -> System.out.println(line));\n<<<explanation>>>: The lines method of the Files class returns a Stream of lines read from the file. Each line is represented as a String. The forEach method of the Stream interface is used to print each line.\nQuestion: How can I write a file line by line in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.write\n<<<code>>>: List<String> lines = Arrays.asList(\"line1\", \"line2\", \"line3\");\nFiles.write(Paths.get(\"file.txt\"), lines, StandardOpenOption.CREATE);\n<<<explanation>>>: The write method of the Files class can also be used to write a list of strings to a file. The StandardOpenOption.CREATE option is used to create a new file if it does not exist. Each string in the list is written as a separate line in the file.\nQuestion: How can I read a file line by line in Java using BufferedReader?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: try (BufferedReader br = Files.newBufferedReader(Paths.get(\"file.txt\"))) {\n    String line;\n    while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n        System.out.println(line);\n    }\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The BufferedReader.readLine method of the BufferedReader class reads a line of text from the file. It returns null when there is no more data to read. The try-with-resources statement is used to automatically close the BufferedReader when it is no longer needed.\nQuestion: How can I write a file line by line in Java using BufferedWriter?\nPlease using this api: BufferedWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try (BufferedWriter bw = Files.newBufferedWriter(Paths.get(\"file.txt\"))) {\n    bw.write(\"line1\");\n    bw.newLine();\n    bw.write(\"line"}
