The string is interpreted as a sequence of Unicode characters. The UTF-8 BOM is written as \"\\ufeff\".\nQuestion: How to convert a String to a byte array in Java?\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: String.getBytes\n<<<code>>>: String str = \"Hello World\";\nbyte[] byteArray = str.getBytes();\n<<<explanation>>>: The getBytes() method of the String class returns a sequence of bytes representing the string. The bytes are encoded in the platform's default charset.\nQuestion: How to convert a byte array to a String in Java?\nPlease using this api: new String(byte[], charsetName).\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: new String(byte[], charsetName)\n<<<code>>>: byte[] byteArray = { 0x48, 0x65, 0x6c, 0x6c, 0x6f, 0x20, 0x57, 0x6f, 0x72, 0x6c, 0x64 };\nString str = new String(byteArray, \"UTF-8\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The new String(byte[], charsetName) constructor creates a new String by decoding the specified array of bytes using the named charset. The charsetName parameter is a String that represents the name of a supported charset.\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.readAllBytes.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.readAllBytes\n<<<code>>>: Path path = Paths.get(\"file.txt\");\nbyte[] data = Files.readAllBytes(path);\n<<<explanation>>>: The readAllBytes() method of the Files class returns the contents of the file as a byte array. The file is opened and closed by this method.\nQuestion: How to write to a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.write\n<<<code>>>: Path path = Paths.get(\"file.txt\");\nbyte[] data = \"Hello, World!\".getBytes();\nFiles.write(path, data);\n<<<explanation>>>: The write() method of the Files class writes the specified byte array to the file. If the file does not exist, it is created. If it does exist, it is truncated to zero size.\nQuestion: How to read a file line by line in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.lines.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.lines\n<<<code>>>: Path path = Paths.get(\"file.txt\");\nFiles.lines(path).forEach(line -> System.out.println(line));\n<<<explanation>>>: The lines() method of the Files class returns a Stream that produces lines read from the file. Each line is produced as a String. The file is opened and closed by this method.\nQuestion: How to write to a file line by line in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.write\n<<<code>>>: Path path = Paths.get(\"file.txt\");\nList<String> lines = Arrays.asList(\"Hello, World1\", \"Hello, World2\", \"Hello, World3\");\nFiles.write(path, lines, StandardOpenOption.CREATE, StandardOpenOption.APPEND);\n<<<explanation>>>: The write() method of the Files class can also write a Stream of Strings to the file. The file is opened and closed by this method. The StandardOpenOption.CREATE option creates the file if it does not exist. The StandardOpenOption.APPEND option appends to the file if it exists.\nQuestion: How to read a file as a stream in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.lines.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.lines\n<<<code>>>: Path path = Paths.get(\"file.txt\");\nStream<String> stream = Files.lines(path);\n<<<explanation>>>: The lines() method of"}
