The sort is not stable, i.e., equal elements may not preserve their relative order.\nQuestion: How can I find the maximum and minimum value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {5, 2, 8, 6, 1};\nint max = Arrays.stream(array).max().getAsInt();\nint min = Arrays.stream(array).min().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The max() method returns an OptionalInt that represents the maximum element of this stream. The getAsInt() method returns the value of this OptionalInt. The min() method returns an OptionalInt that represents the minimum element of this stream.\nQuestion: How can I find the average of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\ndouble average = Arrays.stream(array).average().getAsDouble();\n<<<explanation>>>: The average() method returns an OptionalDouble that represents the average of the elements in this stream. The getAsDouble() method returns the value of this OptionalDouble.\nQuestion: How can I find the number of elements in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nlong count = Arrays.stream(array).count();\n<<<explanation>>>: The count() method returns the count of elements in this stream.\nQuestion: How can I find the total number of elements in a 2D array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[][] array = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}, {5, 6}};\nlong count = Arrays.stream(array).flatMapToInt(Arrays::stream).count();\n<<<explanation>>>: The flatMapToInt() method returns a stream consisting of the results of replacing each element of this stream with the contents of a mapped stream produced by applying the provided mapping function to each element. In this case, we use Arrays::stream to convert each 1D array to a stream. The count() method returns the count of elements in this stream.\nQuestion: How can I find the sum of all elements in a 2D array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[][] array = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}, {5, 6}};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).flatMapToInt(Arrays::stream).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The flatMapToInt() method returns a stream consisting of the results of replacing each element of this stream with the contents of a mapped stream produced by applying the provided mapping function to each element. In this case, we use Arrays::stream to convert each 1D array to a stream. The sum() method returns the sum of elements in this stream.\nQuestion: How can I find the maximum and minimum value in a 2D array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[][] array = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}, {5, 6}};\nint max = Ar"}
