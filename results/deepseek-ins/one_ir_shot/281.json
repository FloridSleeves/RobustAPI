This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Java.lang.AssertionError in a SortedArrayList: :So I'm making an Contact Manager App in Android. My professor send us a JUnit test so we can know if our code is working correctly. Now every method has passed the test except the iterator test which fails the test. It appears to be a java.lang.AssertionError and I cant seem to figure out a way of fixing it. If you could see the error and point it out to me would be awesome.

The sort is not stable.\nQuestion: How can I find the maximum value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint max = Arrays.stream(array).max().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The max() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalInt that represents the maximum element of this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation. The getAsInt() method returns the value of this OptionalInt.\nQuestion: How can I find the minimum value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint min = Arrays.stream(array).min().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The min() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalInt that represents the minimum element of this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation. The getAsInt() method returns the value of this OptionalInt.\n\n\nA: The error you're seeing is not related to the Java API you're using, but rather to the way you're using JUnit tests.\nThe java.lang.AssertionError is a runtime exception that gets thrown when an assertion made in your test fails.\n\n*\n\n*Make sure that your test setup is correct.
