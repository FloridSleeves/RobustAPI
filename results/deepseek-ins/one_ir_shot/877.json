The parameters are: 1) The table name(s) to query. 2) The columns to return. 3) The where clause. 4) The where arguments. 5) The group by clause. 6) The having clause. 7) The order by clause. In this case, we are querying both the \"clients\" and \"orders\" tables where the client's id matches the order's id. The result is a Cursor object that can be used to access the results of the query.\nQuestion: How to get the last inserted row id in SQLite?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: SQLiteDatabase.insert\n<<<code>>>: long id = db.insert(\"table_name\", null, values);\n<<<explanation>>>: The insert() method in SQLiteDatabase class is used to insert a new row into the database. The parameters are: 1) The table name. 2) The nullColumnHack. 3) The content values. The method returns the row ID of the newly inserted row, or -1 if an error occurred.\nQuestion: How to update a row in SQLite?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: SQLiteDatabase.update\n<<<code>>>: int count = db.update(\"table_name\", values, \"id = ?\", new String[] {\"1\"});\n<<<explanation>>>: The update() method in SQLiteDatabase class is used to update rows in the database. The parameters are: 1) The table name. 2) The new values. 3) The where clause. 4) The where arguments. The method returns the number of rows affected.\nQuestion: How to delete a row in SQLite?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: SQLiteDatabase.delete\n<<<code>>>: int count = db.delete(\"table_name\", \"id = ?\", new String[] {\"1\"});\n<<<explanation>>>: The delete() method in SQLiteDatabase class is used to delete rows from the database. The parameters are: 1) The table name. 2) The where clause. 3) The where arguments. The method returns the number of rows affected.\nQuestion: How to create a table in SQLite?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: SQLiteDatabase.execSQL\n<<<code>>>: db.execSQL(\"CREATE TABLE table_name (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, age INTEGER)\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The execSQL() method in SQLiteDatabase class is used to execute a single SQL statement that is not a SELECT or any other SQL statement that returns data. The parameters are: 1) The SQL statement to execute.\nQuestion: How to insert data into a table in SQLite?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: SQLiteDatabase.insert\n<<<code>>>: long id = db.insert(\"table_name\", null, values);\n<<<explanation>>>: The insert() method in SQLiteDatabase class is used to insert a new row into the database.
