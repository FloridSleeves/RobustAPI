The print() method writes a line of text. The write() method writes a portion of an array of characters. The write(char[] buf, int off, int len) method writes a portion of an array of characters. The write(int c) method writes a single character. The write(String s) method writes a string. The write(char[] buf) method writes an array of characters. The write(String s, int off, int len) method writes a portion of a string. The write(int c, int len) method writes a specified length of a single character. The write(byte[] buf, int off, int len) method writes a portion of an array of bytes. The write(byte[] buf) method writes an array of bytes. The write(int c, int off, int len) method writes a portion of a single character. The write(long l) method writes a long. The write(long l, int off, int len) method writes a portion of a long. The write(double d) method writes a double. The write(double d, int off, int len) method writes a portion of a double. The write(String s, int off, int len) method writes a portion of a string. The write(char[] buf, int off, int len) method writes a portion of an array of characters. The write(byte[] buf, int off, int len) method writes a portion of an array of bytes. The write(char[] buf, int off, int len) method writes a portion of an array of characters. The write(byte[] buf, int off, int len) method writes a portion of an array of bytes.\nQuestion: How to create a new thread in Java?\nPlease using this api: Thread.start.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Thread.start\n<<<code>>>: Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {\n    // Your code here\n});\nthread.start();\n<<<explanation>>>: The start() method of the Thread class starts a new thread of execution in this thread of execution. The Java Virtual Machine can schedule this thread later. When this method is invoked more than once on the same thread, the second and subsequent invocations are ignored.\nQuestion: How to create a new thread in Java using Runnable?\nPlease using this api: Thread.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Thread\n<<<code>>>: Runnable task = () -> {\n    // Your code here\n};\nThread thread = new Thread(task);\nthread.start();\n<<<explanation>>>: The Thread class in Java represents a thread of execution in a program. A thread is the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by a scheduler, which is typically within a program.\n```\n\n## Answer:\n```\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.
