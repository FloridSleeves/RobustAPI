I am trying to create a separate class without a new user interface. Supposed I have a main activity wherein if I click a button it will initiate a class and call the method in it and display the text on the main activity.Now I have create created a Main activity and a class which named as BluetoothOn: Please take a look at my code:This is the main activity where the enablemyBluetooth method is the button clickpublic class MainActivity{........public void enablemyBluetooth(View view){                 BluetoothOn ble = new BluetoothOn();    ble.initializeBlue();}}Now I create a class wherein I planned to do all the processes here without intervening on the Main activity of the program, like it is running on the background.. here in my code I just want to change the Textview but when I run it on my android it states that unfortunately the app stopped.public class BluetoothOn {private void initializeBlue(){    textView1 =(TextView)findViewById(R.id.textView1);    textView1.setText(BleisOn);}}Please take note that I have compiled this program with no error/ all variables are declared. I have tried to create the Bluetooth class as private on the Main and it works. I just want to create it as another class on the package for organizing my code.Is it really necessary that I have to create another activity if I want to create a separate class? Can anyone give me hints what should I do or declare? Please help thank you.Update: thank you for all your answers, unfortunately I can't make this simple process to work on another class... I'm quite new to Java and still learning my way.. anyways here is what I encountered.I followed the post suggested by unohu however it provides me an error on the Main that \"The method to initializeBlue() in the type BluetoothOn is not applicable for the arguments.Here is a more complete code of the classes:Main activity:public class MainActivity extends Activity {     public void enableBluetooth (View view){         BluetoothOn ble = new BluetoothOn();    ble.initializeBlue();   // error on this part    }       }BluetoothOn class:  public class BluetoothOn{        public TextView textView1;    public void initializeBlue(View myView){        String BleisOn = \"connect me now\";        textView1 = (TextView)myView.findViewById(R.id.textView1);        textView1.setText(BleisOn);    }}note: I got a typo on the initial post, I declared the initialize as private but it should be public.

This method is used to get the reference of the view in the current activity.\nQuestion: How can I create a custom dialog in Android?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: AlertDialog.Builder\n<<<code>>>: AlertDialog.Builder builder = new AlertDialog.Builder(this);\nbuilder.setTitle(\"Dialog Title\");\nbuilder.setMessage(\"Dialog Message\");\nbuilder.setPositiveButton(\"OK\", new DialogInterface.OnClickListener() {\n    @Override\n    public void onClick(DialogInterface dialog, int which) {\n        // Do something when positive button is clicked\n    }\n});\nAlertDialog dialog = builder.create();\ndialog.show();\n<<<explanation>>>: The AlertDialog.Builder class is used to create an AlertDialog. It provides methods to set the title, message, and buttons of the dialog. The create() method is used to create the AlertDialog, and the show() method is used to display the dialog.\nQuestion: How can I create a custom list view in Android?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: ArrayAdapter, ListView\n<<<code>>>: String[] data = {\"Item 1\", \"Item 2\", \"Item 3\"};\nArrayAdapter<String> adapter = new ArrayAdapter<String>(this, android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1, data);\nListView listView = (ListView) findViewById(R.id.listView);\nlistView.setAdapter(adapter);\n<<<explanation>>>: The ArrayAdapter class is used to bridge an array of objects and a resource that describes how the objects should appear. The ListView class is a widget that displays a list of scrollable items. The setAdapter() method is used to set the data and how it should be displayed in the ListView.\nQuestion: How can I create a custom adapter for a ListView in Android?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: ArrayAdapter, ListView\n<<<code>>>: String[] data = {\"Item 1\", \"Item 2\", \"Item 3\"};\nArrayAdapter<String> adapter = new ArrayAdapter<String>(this, R.layout.custom_list_item, data);\nListView listView = (ListView) findViewById(R.id.listView);\nlistView.setAdapter(adapter);\n<<<explanation>>>: The ArrayAdapter class is used to bridge an array of objects and a resource that describes how the objects should appear. The ListView class is a widget that displays a list of scrollable items. The setAdapter() method is used to set the data and how it should be displayed in the ListView. The custom_list_item resource is a layout file that describes how each item in the ListView should be displayed.\n\n\nA: You can calculate the sum of an array in Java using the Arrays.stream API as follows:\nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n\nIn this code, Arrays.stream(array) creates a stream of integers from the array. The sum() method then calculates the sum of these integers.\n\nA: You can create a custom adapter for a ListView in Android by extending the BaseAdapter class. Here's a simple example:\n\n```java\npublic class CustomAdapter extends BaseAdapter {\n    private Context mContext;\n    private String[] mData;\n\n    public CustomAdapter(Context context, String[] data) {\n        mContext = context;\n        mData = data;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public int getCount() {\n        return mData.length;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public Object getItem(int position) {\n        return mData[position];\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public long getItemId(int position) {\n        return position;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {\n        if (convertView == null) {\n            LayoutInflater inflater = (LayoutInflater) mContext.getSystemService(Context.LAYOUT_INFLATER_SERVICE);\n           "}
