This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: What is the difference between the '==' operator and the equals() method in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: '==' operator and equals() method\n<<<code>>>: String str1 = new String(\"Hello\");\nString str2 = new String(\"Hello\");\nboolean isEqual = str1 == str2; // false\nboolean isEqual2 = str1.equals(str2); // true\n<<<explanation>>>: The '==' operator checks if both objects point to the same memory location. It returns true if both objects are the same. The equals() method checks if the actual content of both objects is the same. It returns true if the content of both objects is the same.\nQuestion: How can I find the maximum value in an array in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint max = Arrays.stream(array).max().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The max() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalInt that represents the maximum element of this stream. The getAsInt() method returns the value of this OptionalInt. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the minimum value in an array in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint min = Arrays.stream(array).min().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The min() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalInt that represents the minimum element of this stream. The getAsInt() method returns the value of this OptionalInt. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the average of an array in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\ndouble average = Arrays.stream(array).average().getAsDouble();\n<<<explanation>>>: The average() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalDouble that represents the average of the elements of this stream. The getAsDouble() method returns the value of this OptionalDouble. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the count of elements in an array in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nlong count = Arrays.stream(array).count();\n<<<explanation>>>: The count() method of the Stream interface returns the count of elements in this stream. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I check if a string is empty in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: String.isEmpty\n<<<code>>>: String str = \"\";\nboolean isEmpty = str.isEmpty(); // true\n<<<explanation>>>: The isEmpty() method of the String class returns true if and only if the length of this string is 0.\nQuestion: How can I check if a string is not empty in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: !String.isEmpty\n<<<code>>>: String str = \"Hello\";\nboolean isNotEmpty = !str.isEmpty(); // true\n<<<explanation>>>: The isEmpty() method of the String class returns true if and only if the length of this string is 0. The '!' operator negates the result of the isEmpty() method. So, if the string is not empty, isNotEmpty will be true.\nQuestion: How can I check if a string is null in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: == operator\n<<<code>>>: String str = null;\nboolean isNull = str == null; // true\n<<<explanation>>>: The '==' operator checks if both objects point to the same memory location. It returns true if both objects are"}
