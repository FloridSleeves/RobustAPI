This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: What is the difference between the '==' operator and the 'equals()' method in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: '==' operator and equals() method\n<<<code>>>: int a = 10;\nint b = 10;\nString s1 = new String(\"Hello\");\nString s2 = new String(\"Hello\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The '==' operator is used to compare primitive data types and references. It checks if both objects point to the same memory location. For objects, it checks if they are the same instance.\nFor equals() method, it is a method of Object class. It is used to compare the content of two objects. By default, it checks if both objects point to the same memory location. But, it can be overridden to compare the content of the objects.\n\n```java\nSystem.out.println(a == b); // true, because both are pointing to the same memory location\nSystem.out.println(s1 == s2); // false, because s1 and s2 are different objects\nSystem.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); // true, because content of s1 and s2 are same\n```\n\nQuestion: What is the difference between '==' and '===' in JavaScript?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: '==' and '===' in JavaScript\n<<<code>>>: let a = 10;\nlet b = \"10\";\n<<<explanation>>>: In JavaScript, '==' is a loose equality operator that compares two values for equality. It performs type coercion if the operands are of different types.\n'===' is a strict equality operator that compares two values for equality, and also checks the type of the operands.\n```javascript\nconsole.log(a == b); // true, because '==' performs type coercion\nconsole.log(a === b); // false, because '===' checks type as well\n```\n\nQuestion: What is the difference between '==' and '===' in Python?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: '==' and '===' in Python\n<<<code>>>: a = 10\nb = \"10\"\n<<<explanation>>>: In Python, '==' is a comparison operator that checks if the values of two operands are equal or not. If they are equal, the condition becomes true.\n'===' is not a built-in operator in Python. It's a common convention to use '==' for equality and '=' for assignment.\n```python\nprint(a == b) # True, because '==' checks for equality\nprint(a === b) # Error, '===' is not a valid operator in Python\n```\n\nQuestion: What is the difference between '==' and '===' in C#?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: '==' and '===' in C#\n<<<code>>>: int a = 10;\nstring b = \"10\";\n<<<explanation>>>: In C#, '==' is a comparison operator that checks if the values of two operands are equal or not. If they are equal, the condition becomes true.\n'===' is not a built-in operator in C#. It's a common convention to use '==' for equality and '=' for assignment.\n```csharp\nConsole.WriteLine(a == b); // True, because '==' checks for equality\nConsole.WriteLine(a === b); // Error, '===' is not a valid operator in C#\n```\n\nQuestion: What is the difference between '==' and '===' in Swift?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: '==' and '===' in Swift\n<<<code>>>: let a = 10\nlet b = \"10\"\n<<<explanation>>>: In Swift, '==' is a comparison operator that checks if the values of two operands are equal or not.
