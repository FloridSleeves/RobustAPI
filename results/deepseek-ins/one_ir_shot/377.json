If no vertex is found, it returns null.\n\n\nA: The difference between the two methods you mentioned is due to the nature of the data they are trying to access.\n\n\n*\n\n*Iterator.next() returns the next element in the iteration. If there are no more elements in the iteration, it throws a NoSuchElementException.\n\n*OrientGraph.getVertexByKey() returns the vertex with the specified key. If the vertex does not exist, it returns null.\n\n\nIn your case, the first method works because you are iterating over a collection of vertices and getting the next element in the iteration. The second method does not work because you are trying to access a specific vertex by its key, which does not exist in your graph.\nIf you want to print out the vertex with the key \"SPECIAL-NODE\" and the value \"SPECIAL\", you should use the getVertexByKey() method:\nSystem.out.println(ograph.getVertexByKey(\"SPECIAL-NODE\", \"SPECIAL\"));\n\nIf you want to print out all vertices with the key \"SPECIAL-NODE\" and the value \"SPECIAL\", you should use the getVertices() method:\nIterable<Vertex> vertices = ograph.getVertices(\"SPECIAL-NODE\", \"SPECIAL\");\nfor (Vertex vertex : vertices) {\n    System.out.println(vertex);\n}\n\nIn both cases, you are using the correct API methods.
