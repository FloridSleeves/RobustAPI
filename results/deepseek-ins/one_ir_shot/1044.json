This is a terminal operation.\n\nA: Here is how you can calculate the sum of an array using Java 8's Stream API:\n\n```java\nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n```\n\nIn this code, `Arrays.stream(array)` creates a Stream of integers from the array. The `sum()` method then calculates the sum of these integers.\n\nAs for your second question, you can use a `StringTokenizer` to split the input string into tokens. Then, you can use a `switch` statement to convert the tokens into integers and add them to the sum:\n\n```java\nStringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(\"one two three\");\nint sum = 0;\nwhile (st.hasMoreTokens()) {\n    String token = st.nextToken();\n    switch (token) {\n        case \"one\":\n            sum += 1;\n            break;\n        case \"two\":\n            sum += 2;\n            break;\n        case \"three\":\n            sum += 3;\n            break;\n        // add more cases as needed\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, `st.nextToken()` gets the next token from the string. The `switch` statement then converts the token into an integer and adds it to the sum.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the input string is in English and that the words \"one\", \"two\", and \"three\" are the only words in the string. If the input string can have other words, you will need to add more cases to the `switch` statement.\n\nAlso, this code does not handle numbers greater than 9 or compound numbers (like \"thirty-two\"). If you need to handle these cases, you will need to add more code to convert the tokens into integers.\n\nI hope this helps, and let me know if you have any other questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
