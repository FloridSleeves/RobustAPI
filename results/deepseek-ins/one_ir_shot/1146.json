(5 answers)                            Closed 9 years ago.I am trying to fill an arrayList with objects created from reading integers from a text file that represent points (two integers per line).  I'm attempting to do this in a loop.  The ArrayList seems to fill, but when I print it out after, all the elements in each index are the same as the last element added to the ArrayList.  This seems to have something to do with each arrayList index pointing to the object (my newbie guess).  Do I have to create a unique object for each arrayList entry? Is there an easy way to add to this code to do this?public class Point2DDemo extends Point2D<Double>{    ArrayList<Point2DDemo> Points = new ArrayList<Point2DDemo>(7);    /**     * Constructor for objects of class Point2DDemo     */    public Point2DDemo()    {    }    public Point2DDemo(double first, double second)    {        setFirst(first);        setSecond(second);    }    public void putPair(double point1, double point2){        this.setFirst(point1);        this.setSecond(point2);    }    /**     *      *      * @param  y   a sample parameter for a method     * @return     the sum of x and y      */    public void createList()    {        FileIO readFile = new FileIO();        readFile.openInputFile();        String pointLine = null;        Point2DDemo newPoints = new Point2DDemo();        StringTokenizer stringSplit = null;        while(readFile.hasInputLine())        {           pointLine = readFile.readInputLine();           stringSplit = new StringTokenizer(pointLine);           double pointX = Double.parseDouble(stringSplit.nextToken());           double pointY = Double.parseDouble(stringSplit.nextToken());           newPoints.putPair(pointX, pointY);           Points.add(newPoints);        }        for(int i = 0; i < Points.size(); i++)         System.out.println(Points.get(i));         readFile.closeInputFile();    }\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.

The try block contains the code that may throw an exception. The catch block contains the code to handle the exception. The finally block contains the code to be executed regardless of whether an exception occurred.\n\n\nA: Here is the answer to your questions:\n\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nAnswer: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n\nQuestion: filling array list with objects, causing all elements to be the same in list:\nAnswer: You are adding the same object (newPoints) to the ArrayList in each iteration.
