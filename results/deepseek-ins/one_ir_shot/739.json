This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\n\nQuestion: How to append text to an existing file in Java?\nAnswer:\n```java\nPrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"filename.txt\", \"UTF-8\");\nwriter.println(\"Text to append\");\nwriter.close();\n```\nExplanation: The println() method of the PrintWriter class writes a line of text followed by a line separator.
