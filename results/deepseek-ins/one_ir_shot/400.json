This is a terminal operation.\n\nQuestion: How to find the minimum value in a list in Java?\nPlease using this api: Collections.min.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Collections.min\n<<<code>>>: int min = Collections.min(list);\n<<<explanation>>>: The min() method of the Collections class returns the minimum element in a collection. This is a terminal operation.\n\nQuestion: How to find the maximum value in a list in Java?\nPlease using this api: Collections.max.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Collections.max\n<<<code>>>: int max = Collections.max(list);\n<<<explanation>>>: The max() method of the Collections class returns the maximum element in a collection. This is a terminal operation.\n\nQuestion: How to find the average of a list in Java?\nPlease using this api: IntStream.average.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: IntStream.average\n<<<code>>>: OptionalDouble average = list.stream().mapToInt(i -> i).average();\n<<<explanation>>>: The average() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalDouble describing the arithmetic mean of elements of this stream, or an empty OptionalDouble if the stream is empty. This is a terminal operation.\n\nQuestion: How to find the sum of a list in Java?\nPlease using this api: IntStream.sum.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: IntStream.sum\n<<<code>>>: int sum = list.stream().mapToInt(i -> i).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a terminal operation.\n\nQuestion: How to find the product of a list in Java?\nPlease using this api: IntStream.reduce.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: IntStream.reduce\n<<<code>>>: OptionalInt product = list.stream().mapToInt(i -> i).reduce((a, b) -> a * b);\n<<<explanation>>>: The reduce() method of the IntStream class performs a reduction on the elements of this stream, using the provided identity and an associative binary operator. This is a terminal operation.\n\nQuestion: How to find the median of a list in Java?\nPlease using this api: Collections.sort.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Collections.sort\n<<<code>>>: Collections.sort(list);\nint middle = list.size()/2;\nint median;\nif (list.size()%2 == 1) {\n    median = list.get(middle);\n} else {\n    median = (list.get(middle-1) + list.get(middle)) / 2;\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The sort() method of the Collections class sorts the elements in the list into ascending order. This is a non-terminal operation. The median is the middle value in a sorted list. If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.\n\nQuestion: How to find the mode of a list in Java?\nPlease using this api: Collections.frequency.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Collections.frequency\n<<<code>>>: int max=0;\nint mode=list.get(0);\nfor(int i:list){\n    int freq = Collections.frequency(list,i);\n    if(freq>max){\n        max = freq;\n        mode = i;\n    }\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The frequency() method of the Collections class returns the number of elements in the specified collection that are equal to the specified object. This is a terminal operation. The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a list.\n\nQuestion: How to find the range of a list in Java?\nPlease using this api: Collections.max and Collections.min.\nAnswer: <<<api"}
