You can modify the code to format the input as you need. For example, you can use a StringTokenizer to split the line into tokens and write only some of them to the output file.\n\nPlease replace \"input.txt\" and \"output.txt\" with your actual file names.\n\nAlso, make sure that the files are in the same directory as your Java program or provide the full path to the files.\n\nThis is a very basic example. In a real-world application, you would need to handle potential exceptions and errors more gracefully.\n\nNote: This code assumes that the input file exists and can be read, and that the output file can be written to. If these conditions are not met, the code will throw an IOException.\n\nThis code also assumes that the input file is small enough to fit into memory. If the input file is larger, you would need to use a different approach to read the file, such as reading and processing the file line by line using a BufferedReader.\n\nThis code does not calculate the sum of the numbers in the file. If you need to calculate the sum of the numbers in the file, you would need to read the file line by line, split the line into"}
