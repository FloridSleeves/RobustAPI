The new thread is running the code that is provided in the Runnable's run method.\nQuestion: What is the difference between the two following methods of creating a new thread in Java?\nPlease using this api: Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor\n<<<code>>>: ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();\nexecutorService.submit(() -> System.out.println(\"Hello, World!\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The newSingleThreadExecutor() method of the Executors class creates a new ExecutorService that uses a single worker thread operating off an unbounded queue. The worker thread is created on-demand as needed and will be reused for subsequent tasks.
