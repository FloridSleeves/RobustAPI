Please advise.\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: String.getBytes\n<<<code>>>: String str = \"Hello World\";\nbyte[] bytes = str.getBytes();\n<<<explanation>>>: The getBytes() method of the String class returns a sequence of bytes that represent the string. The bytes are encoded in the platform's default charset.
