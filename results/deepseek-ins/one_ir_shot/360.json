In the case of a HashMap, the next element is a Map.Entry object. If we try to assign it directly to a Map.Entry object without casting, it will result in a ClassCastException.\nQuestion: What is the difference between the '==' operator and the equals() method in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: == and equals()\n<<<code>>>: int a = 1;\nint b = 1;\nString s1 = new String(\"Hello\");\nString s2 = new String(\"Hello\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The '==' operator compares the references of the objects. If the references point to the same object, it returns true. If they point to different objects, it returns false.\nThe equals() method, on the other hand, compares the actual content of the objects. It is a method of the Object class and is overridden in all classes. It returns true if the content of the objects is the same, and false otherwise.\nFor primitive types like int, '==' and equals() behave the same. But for objects, '==' checks if they are the same object (i.e., they point to the same memory location), while equals() checks if they are logically equal (i.e., they have the same content).\nQuestion: What is the difference between the '==' operator and the equals() method in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: == and equals()\n<<<code>>>: int a = 1;\nint b = 1;\nString s1 = new String(\"Hello\");\nString s2 = new String(\"Hello\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The '==' operator compares the references of the objects.
