The character to be written is given as an integer. This method is overridden in the Writer class and, in turn, by the subclasses of Writer.\nQuestion: How can I sort a list of integers in descending order in Java 8?\nPlease using this api: Stream.sorted.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Stream.sorted\n<<<code>>>: List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(5, 3, 2, 1, 4);\nList<Integer> sortedList = list.stream().sorted(Comparator.reverseOrder()).collect(Collectors.toList());\n<<<explanation>>>: The sorted() method of the Stream class returns a stream consisting of the elements of this stream, sorted according to the provided Comparator. The Comparator.reverseOrder() method returns a comparator that imposes the reverse of the natural ordering.\n\n\nA: The problem in your code is that you are creating a new PrintWriter every time you want to write to the file. This means that every time you call data.println(gpsInfo), you are opening a new file and writing to it. Instead, you should open the file once, and then write to it as many times as you want.\nHere's how you can modify your code:\npublic void run () {\n    byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\n    int len = -1;\n    try {\n        PrintWriter data = new PrintWriter(\"test.txt\"); // Open the file once\n        while ( ( len = this.in.read(buffer)) > -1 ) {\n            String gpsInfo = new String(buffer,0,len);\n            data.println(gpsInfo); // Write to the file\n            System.out.print(gpsInfo);\n        }\n        data.close(); // Close the file when you're done\n    } catch ( IOException e ) {\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    }\n}\n\nThis way, your GPS data will be written to the file \"test.txt\" as long as the program is running. When the program ends, the file will be automatically closed.\n\nA: The problem in your code is that you are creating a new PrintWriter every time you want to write to the file.

When the program ends, the file will be automatically closed.\n\nA: Your code is correct, but it seems like you are not closing the PrintWriter. Always remember to close the PrintWriter after you are done with it.\nHere is the corrected code:\npublic void run () {\n    byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\n    int len = -1;\n    PrintWriter data = null;\n    try {\n        data = new PrintWriter(\"test.txt\");\n        while ( ( len = this.in.read(buffer)) > -1 ) {\n            String gpsInfo = new String(buffer,0,len);\n            data.println(gpsInfo);\n            System.out.print(gpsInfo);\n        }\n    } catch ( IOException e ) {\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    } finally {\n"}
