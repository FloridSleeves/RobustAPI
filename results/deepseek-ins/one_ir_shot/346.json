The WeakHashMap uses WeakReferences to the keys, which means that the keys can be garbage collected when they are no longer in use. The values in the map are not subject to this. The iterator is used to remove entries from the map when they are no longer in use.\nQuestion: How to sort a list of objects by a specific property in Java?\nPlease using this api: Stream.sorted.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Stream.sorted\n<<<code>>>: List<Person> persons = Arrays.asList(\n    new Person(\"Max\", 18),\n    new Person(\"Peter\", 23),\n    new Person(\"Pamela\", 23),\n    new Person(\"David\", 12));\n\npersons.stream()\n    .sorted(Comparator.comparing(Person::getAge).thenComparing(Person::getName))\n    .forEach(System.out::println);\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The sorted() method of the Stream interface is used to sort the elements of the stream. It takes a Comparator as a parameter. The Comparator.comparing() method is used to specify the property to be used for sorting. If there are multiple properties to be sorted, then the thenComparing() method can be used. The forEach() method is used to print the sorted elements.\n\n```\n\n## Answer:\n```\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nAnswer:\n<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.
