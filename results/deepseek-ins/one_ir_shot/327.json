Why is it giving me the error?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: Iterator it = this.iterator();\nE next = it.next();\n<<<explanation>>>: The method next() in the Iterator interface returns an object of type Object. The type parameter E is used to indicate that the method will return an element of the type E. The compiler will then check that the returned object is indeed of type E. If it is not, the compiler will give an error.\nQuestion: What is the difference between the '==' operator and the equals() method in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: '==' operator and equals() method\n<<<code>>>: int a = 10;\nint b = 10;\nString str1 = new String(\"Hello\");\nString str2 = new String(\"Hello\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The '==' operator is used to compare the references of two objects. It checks if both objects point to the same memory location.\nOn the other hand, the equals() method is used to compare the actual contents of two objects. It checks if the contents of both objects are equal.\nQuestion: What is the difference between the '==' operator and the equals() method in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: '==' operator and equals() method\n<<<code>>>: int a = 10;\nint b = 10;\nString str1 = new String(\"Hello\");\nString str2 = new String(\"Hello\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The '==' operator is used to compare the references of two objects.
