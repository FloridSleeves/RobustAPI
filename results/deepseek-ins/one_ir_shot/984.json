This method is used for testing.\nQuestion: What is the difference between the '==' and 'equals' operators in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: '==' and 'equals'\n<<<code>>>: int a = 10;\nint b = 10;\nString s1 = new String(\"Hello\");\nString s2 = new String(\"Hello\");\n<<<explanation>>>: '==' is a relational operator used to compare if both objects point to the same memory location. It returns true if both objects point to the same location else it returns false.\n'equals()' is a method used to compare the actual values of the objects. It returns true if the values are equal else it returns false.\nQuestion: How can I sort an array in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.sort\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {5, 2, 8, 6, 1};\nArrays.sort(array);\n<<<explanation>>>: The sort() method of the Arrays class sorts the specified array of objects into ascending numerical order.\nQuestion: How can I find the maximum and minimum value in an array in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {5, 2, 8, 6, 1};\nint max = Arrays.stream(array).max().getAsInt();\nint min = Arrays.stream(array).min().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The max() and min() methods of the IntStream class return an OptionalInt that represents the maximum and minimum value of this stream respectively. The getAsInt() method is used to get the value from the OptionalInt.\nQuestion: How can I find the average of an array in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {5, 2, 8, 6, 1};\ndouble average = Arrays.stream(array).average().getAsDouble();\n<<<explanation>>>: The average() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalDouble that represents the average of the elements of this stream. The getAsDouble() method is used to get the value from the OptionalDouble.\nQuestion: How can I find the number of elements in an array in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {5, 2, 8, 6, 1};\nlong count = Arrays.stream(array).count();\n<<<explanation>>>: The count() method of the Stream interface returns the count of elements in this stream.\nQuestion: How can I find the sum of the squares of the elements in an array in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {5, 2, 8, 6, 1};\nint sumOfSquares = Arrays.stream(array).map(n -> n * n).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The map() method of the IntStream class returns a stream consisting of the results of applying the given function to the elements of this stream. The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.\nQuestion: How can I find the product of the elements in an array in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {5, 2, 8, 6, 1};\nint product = Arrays.stream(array).reduce(1, (a, b) -> a * b);\n<<<explanation>>>: The reduce() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalInt that represents the reduction of the elements of this stream according to the provided binary operator. The binary operator is a lambda function that takes two integers and returns an integer. The identity element is the initial value of the reduction.\nQuestion: How can I find the number of elements in an array that satisfy a certain condition in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {5, 2, 8, 6, 1"}
