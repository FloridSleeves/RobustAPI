This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\n\n\nA: The problem is that you are trying to use the same variable name for different things. In your code, you have a variable named \"sum\" that is used to store the sum of the array, and then you have a variable named \"sum\" that is used to store the sum of the squares of the array. \n\nIn Java, you cannot have two variables with the same name in the same scope. This is because the Java compiler uses the variable name to determine the type of the variable. If the compiler sees the name \"sum\" twice in the same scope, it will assume that you are trying to use two different types of \"sum\" (one for the sum of the array, and one for the sum of the squares of the array), which is not allowed.\n\nTo fix this problem, you should use different variable names for the sum of the array and the sum of the squares of the array. Here is an example of how you can do this:\n\n```java\nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sumOfArray = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\nint sumOfSquares = Arrays.stream(array).map(x -> x * x).sum();\n```\n\nIn this code, \"sumOfArray\" is used to store the sum of the array, and \"sumOfSquares\" is used to store the sum of"}
