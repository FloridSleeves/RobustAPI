Improve this question                    I have a string 'line' in java containing numbers , for example , \"34 55  64 \"I want to store these 3 numbers in  int x , y ,zwhen I do ,x = Integer.parseInt(line[0]) y = Integer.parseInt(line[1])I get an error saying a \"array required but string found \" . I do not understand why it needs an array x,y,z are declared integers and line is declared as a string\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.

I do not understand why it needs an array x,y,z are declared integers and line is declared as a string\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer\n<<<code>>>: StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(line);\nint x = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\nint y = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\nint z = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\n<<<explanation>>>: The StringTokenizer class in Java is used to break a string into tokens. The tokens are obtained by splitting the string using the delimiters. In this case, the delimiter is a space. The nextToken() method is used to get the next token from the string.\nQuestion: How can I read a file in Java?:\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"file.txt\"));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The readLine() method of the BufferedReader class is used to read a line of text. It returns null if the end of the stream has been reached. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I write to a file in Java?:\nPlease using this api: BufferedWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedWriter\n<<<code>>>: BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(\"file.txt\"));\nbw.write(\"Hello, World!\");\nbw.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The write() method of the BufferedWriter class is used to write text to the file. The close() method is used to close the stream, flushing it first. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I sort an array in Java?:\nPlease using this api: Arrays.sort.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.sort\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {5, 2, 8, 1, 9};\nArrays.sort(array);\n<<<explanation>>>: The sort() method of the Arrays class is used to sort the elements in the array. The sorting is in ascending order by default. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the maximum and minimum value in an array in Java?:\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {5, 2, 8, 1, 9};\nint max = Arrays.stream(array).max().getAsInt();\nint min = Arrays.stream(array).min().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The max() and min() methods of the IntStream class are used to find the maximum and minimum values in the stream. The getAsInt() method is used to get the result as an int. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the average of an array in Java?:\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {5, 2, 8, 1, 9};\ndouble average = Arrays.stream(array).average().getAsDouble();\n<<<explanation>>>: The average() method of the IntStream class is used to calculate the average of the elements in the stream. The getAsDouble() method is used to get the result as a double. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the sum of the squares of an array in Java?:\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {5, 2, 8, 1, 9};\nint sumOfSquares = Arrays.stream(array).map(n -> n * n).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The map() method of the IntStream class is used to transform each element of the stream. In this case, we square each number. The sum() method is used to calculate the sum of the elements in the stream. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I find the product of an array in Java?:\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>"}
