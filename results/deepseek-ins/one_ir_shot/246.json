This portion needs to get images from flickr and load them into a texture.

The number of bytes actually read is returned as an integer. This method blocks until some input is available.\nQuestion: How to create a new thread in Java?\nPlease using this api: Thread.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Thread\n<<<code>>>: Thread thread = new Thread(new Runnable() {\n    public void run() {\n        // code to be executed in new thread\n    }\n});\nthread.start();\n<<<explanation>>>: The start() method of the Thread class causes this thread to begin execution; the Java Virtual Machine calls the run method of this thread. The result is that two threads are running concurrently: the current thread (which returns from the call to the start method) and the new thread.\nQuestion: How to create a new thread in Java using lambda expressions?\nPlease using this api: Thread.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Thread\n<<<code>>>: Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {\n    // code to be executed in new thread\n});\nthread.start();\n<<<explanation>>>: Lambda expressions allow you to represent one method interface as an expression. In this case, the Runnable interface has a single method run(), so you can represent it as an expression. The lambda expression () -> {...} represents a single method interface. The lambda expression is passed to the Thread constructor to create a new thread.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
