I have an array of objects that can grow or reduce in size, but it's very important for me to maintain the position they were in relative to each other in the array. I'm thinking because of this I need to use Array instead of an ArrayList which can condense/shift elements around if they are removed/added.The practical example: In my first Java application that I'm slugging through to learn the nuances of this language I'm making a basic poker game simulator. I have Player objects in an array representing the seats they are sitting at, and it's important to know where the dealer button (index) was placed before rotating it. Players being removed or added from an ArrayList will change the indices of the players, and that can throw off the next Player to get it. Dealer button movement is very player-placement specific.Long story short - is using an Array the best way of handling elements in an array-type structure that need to maintain their position in the array? Is there a better method or logic to accomplish this? I apologize for the simple question but I couldn't find any other alternatives and wanted to confirm that this is the best route to take.EDIT:To further clarify, let me give an example of why ArrayList's element movement won't work:Take three players and their indices in the array:0 : Player One (Dealer button)1: Player Two2: Player ThreeIf player two (index one) gets up from the table before the dealer button is rotated, depending on the rules player one will keep the button and the blinds will be adjusted accordingly (there's other variants of this rule, but the one I like to use). In an ArrayList, the internal array will be condensed and player three will end up getting the button an extra round before he should. I need to track the empty seat that was active during the hand but was emptied before the round was over and the button moved.I'm starting to realize that the concept of a \"seat\" is going to be more complicated, I need to track state on it, including \"player just sat down while hand in progress,\" \"player got up while hand in progress,\" etc.  @Stephen P - I think you're right about this, I'm going to need to track them separately and cannot use a simple array structure to determine the logic. Timing of when the elements are added and/or removed is paramount to the application logic, and simply examining if an element is there or not won't cut it.For the Seats themselves, I'm learning towards ArrayList since the Seats will now always be there, no empties. The Seat will just have a reference to the Player object if one is sitting there as well as WHEN that player arrived.

Thanks everyone!\nPlease using this api: SortedMap.firstKey.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: SortedMap.firstKey\n<<<code>>>: SortedMap<Integer, Player> seats = new TreeMap<>();\nint firstSeat = seats.firstKey();\n<<<explanation>>>: The firstKey() method of the SortedMap interface returns the first (lowest) key currently in this map. This is a terminal operation.\n\n\nQuestion: How can I sort a list of objects in Java?\nPlease using this api: Collections.sort.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Collections.sort\n<<<code>>>: List<MyObject> list = new ArrayList<>();\nCollections.sort(list);\n<<<explanation>>>: The sort() method of the Collections class sorts the specified list into ascending order. This is a stable, adaptive, iterative sorting algorithm that has a worst-case time complexity of O(n log n).\n\n\nQuestion: How can I find the maximum value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint max = Arrays.stream(array).max().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The max() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalInt that represents the maximum element of this stream. The getAsInt() method returns the value represented by this OptionalInt. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\n\n\nQuestion: How can I find the minimum value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint min = Arrays.stream(array).min().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The min() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalInt that represents the minimum element of this stream. The getAsInt() method returns the value represented by this OptionalInt. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\n\n\nQuestion: How can I find the average of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\ndouble average = Arrays.stream(array).average().getAsDouble();\n<<<explanation>>>: The average() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalDouble that represents the average of the elements of this stream. The getAsDouble() method returns the value represented by this OptionalDouble. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\n\n\nQuestion: How can I find the median of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\ndouble median = Arrays.stream(array).sorted().skip(array.length/2).findFirst().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sorted() method of the IntStream class returns a new stream consisting of the elements of this stream, sorted in natural order. The skip() method returns a stream consisting of the remaining elements of this stream after discarding the first n elements. The findFirst() method returns an Optional describing the first element of this stream, or an empty Optional if the stream is empty. The getAsInt() method returns the value represented by this OptionalInt. This is a terminal operation.\n\n\nQuestion: How can I find the number of elements in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nlong count = Arrays.stream(array).count();\n<<<explanation>>>: The count() method of the Stream interface returns the count of elements in this stream.
