Instead, you should compare the result of readLine() with null.\nHere is the corrected code:\nwhile((tmp=clientinput.readLine()) != null) {\n    Request.append(tmp);\n}\n\nThis code will append each line read from the client's input to the Request StringBuilder until there are no more lines to read (i.e., readLine() returns null).\n\nA: The problem is that you are comparing a String with null, which is not a good practice.
