This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\n\nQuestion: get file modification time: \nAnswer:\nYou can use the java.nio.file.Files class to get the last modified time of a file. Here is an example:\n\n<<<api>>>: java.nio.file.Files.getLastModifiedTime\n<<<code>>>: \nPath path = Paths.get(\"file.txt\");\nBasicFileAttributes attrs;\ntry {\n    attrs = Files.readAttributes(path, BasicFileAttributes.class);\n    System.out.println(\"Last modified time: \" + attrs.lastModifiedTime().toMillis());\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n<<<ex"}
