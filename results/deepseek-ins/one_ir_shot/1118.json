The tokens are user-defined delimiters. In this case, we are using \"\\n\" as the delimiter to split the textarea value into lines. The countTokens() method returns the number of tokens in this string tokenizer's string. The hasMoreTokens() method tells us whether there are more tokens left in the string. The nextToken() method returns the next token from this string tokenizer.\nQuestion: How to create a new thread in Java:\nPlease using this api: Thread.start.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Thread\n<<<code>>>: new Thread(() -> {\n    // Your code here\n}).start();\n<<<explanation>>>: The start() method is used to start a new thread of execution. It calls the run() method of the Thread class. The run() method contains the code that will be executed in the new thread. In this case, we are passing a lambda expression to the Thread constructor, which is the code that will be executed in the new thread.\n\n```\n\n## 2. Code:\n\n```java\n// Question: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n\n// Question: How to split HTML textarea element into array of lines in Java\nStringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(textarea.getValue(), \"\\n\");\nString[] lines = new String[st.countTokens()];\nint i = 0;\nwhile (st.hasMoreTokens()) {\n    lines[i++] = st.nextToken();\n}\n\n// Question: How to create a new thread in Java\nnew Thread(() -> {\n    // Your code here\n}).start();\n```\n\n## 3. Explanation:\n\n```java\n// Explanation: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n\n// Explanation: The StringTokenizer class is used to break a string into tokens. The tokens are user-defined delimiters.

Conclusion:\n\nIn Java, you can use the Arrays.stream API to calculate the sum of an array, the StringTokenizer API to split an HTML textarea element into an array of lines, and the Thread API to create a new thread.\n\n```java\n// Calculate the sum of an array\nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n\n// Split an HTML textarea element into an array of lines\nStringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(textarea.getValue(), \"\\n\");\nString[] lines = new String[st.countTokens()];\nint i = 0;\nwhile (st.hasMoreTokens()) {\n    lines[i++] = st."}
