It returns the byte data, or -1 if the end of the stream is reached.\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java?:\nPlease using this api: Files.readAllLines.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.readAllLines\n<<<code>>>: List<String> lines = Files.readAllLines(Paths.get(\"C:\\\\path\\\\to\\\\file.txt\"), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);\n<<<explanation>>>: The readAllLines() method of the Files class returns a list containing all lines read from the file. The lines are returned in the order they were in the file.\nQuestion: How to write a file in Java?:\nPlease using this api: Files.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.write\n<<<code>>>: Files.write(Paths.get(\"C:\\\\path\\\\to\\\\file.txt\"), \"Hello, World!\".getBytes(), StandardOpenOption.CREATE);\n<<<explanation>>>: The write() method of the Files class writes bytes to a file. If the file does not exist, it will be created. If the file does exist, it will be overwritten.\nQuestion: How to create a directory in Java?:\nPlease using this api: Files.createDirectories.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.createDirectories\n<<<code>>>: Files.createDirectories(Paths.get(\"C:\\\\path\\\\to\\\\directory\"));\n<<<explanation>>>: The createDirectories() method of the Files class creates a directory and its parents, unless they already exist. If the directory cannot be created (for example, because the parent directory does not exist), then an IOException is thrown.\nQuestion: How to list files in a directory in Java?:\nPlease using this api: Files.list.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.list\n<<<code>>>: try (Stream<Path> stream = Files.list(Paths.get(\"C:\\\\path\\\\to\\\\directory\"))) {\n    stream.forEach(System.out::println);\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The list() method of the Files class returns a stream of Path elements representing the files in the directory. The stream is ordered, Directory Streams, which are a kind of stream, can be used to iterate over the entries in the directory.\n\n\nA: The problem is that the read() method reads the next byte of data from the input stream, but in your case, the executable is returning the sum of the two integers, which is a single byte. So, when you call read(), it returns the sum of the two integers, not the actual sum.\nInstead, you should read the entire output of the process, which should be a string representation of the sum, and then parse that string to get the integer value. Here is how you can do it:\nBufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(pr.getInputStream()));\nString line = reader.readLine();\nint sum = Integer.parseInt(line);\n\nThis will read the entire output of the process, which should be a string representation of the sum, and then parse that string to get the integer value.\n\nA: The problem is that the read() method reads the next byte of data from the input stream, but in your case, the executable is returning the sum of the two integers, which is a single byte.
