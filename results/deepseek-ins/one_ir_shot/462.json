This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to create a new thread in java?\nPlease using this api: Thread.start.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Thread.start\n<<<code>>>: Thread thread = new Thread(new Runnable() {\n    public void run() {\n        // Code to be executed in new thread\n    }\n});\nthread.start();\n<<<explanation>>>: The start() method of the Thread class causes this thread to begin execution; the Java Virtual Machine calls the run method of this thread. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to handle exceptions in java?\nPlease using this api: try-catch-finally.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: try-catch-finally\n<<<code>>>: try {\n    // Code that may throw an exception\n} catch (ExceptionType name) {\n    // Code to handle the exception\n} finally {\n    // Code to be executed regardless of whether an exception was thrown\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The try-catch-finally block is used to handle exceptions in Java. The try block contains the code that may throw an exception. The catch block contains the code to handle the exception. The finally block contains the code to be executed regardless of whether an exception was thrown.\nQuestion: How to create a new instance of a class in java?\nPlease using this api: new.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: new\n<<<code>>>: ClassName instance = new ClassName();\n<<<explanation>>>: The new keyword in Java is used to create a new instance of a class.\nQuestion: How to create a new instance of an interface in java?\nPlease using this api: new.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: new\n<<<code>>>: InterfaceName instance = new ClassNameThatImplementsInterface();\n<<<explanation>>>: The new keyword in Java is used to create a new instance of a class that implements an interface.\nQuestion: How to create a new instance of an abstract class in java?\nPlease using this api: new.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: new\n<<<code>>>: AbstractClassName instance = new ConcreteClassName();\n<<<explanation>>>: The new keyword in Java is used to create a new instance of a"}
