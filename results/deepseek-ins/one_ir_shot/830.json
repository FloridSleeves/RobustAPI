The println() method appends a newline character to the output. The close() method is used to close the stream and release any system resources it holds.\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java line by line?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"file.txt\"));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\nreader.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The readLine() method of the BufferedReader class is used to read a line of text. It returns null when there is no more lines to read. This is a terminal operation. The close() method is used to close the stream and release any system resources it holds.\nQuestion: How to convert a string to an integer in Java?\nPlease using this api: Integer.parseInt.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Integer.parseInt\n<<<code>>>: String str = \"123\";\nint num = Integer.parseInt(str);\n<<<explanation>>>: The parseInt() method of the Integer class is used to convert a string to an integer. It throws a NumberFormatException if the string does not represent a valid integer.\nQuestion: How to convert a string to a double in Java?\nPlease using this api: Double.parseDouble.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Double.parseDouble\n<<<code>>>: String str = \"123.45\";\ndouble num = Double.parseDouble(str);\n<<<explanation>>>: The parseDouble() method of the Double class is used to convert a string to a double. It throws a NumberFormatException if the string does not represent a valid double.\nQuestion: How to convert an integer to a string in Java?\nPlease using this api: Integer.toString.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Integer.toString\n<<<code>>>: int num = 123;\nString str = Integer.toString(num);\n<<<explanation>>>: The toString() method of the Integer class is used to convert an integer to a string.\nQuestion: How to convert a double to a string in Java?\nPlease using this api: Double.toString.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Double.toString\n<<<code>>>: double num = 123.45;\nString str = Double.toString(num);\n<<<explanation>>>: The toString() method of the Double class is used to convert a double to a string.\nQuestion: How to create a new file in Java?\nPlease using this api: File.createNewFile.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: File.createNewFile\n<<<code>>>: File file = new File(\"file.txt\");\ntry {\n    if (file.createNewFile()) {\n        System.out.println(\"File created successfully\");\n    } else {\n        System.out.println(\"File already exists\");\n    }\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The createNewFile() method of the File class is used to create a new file. It returns true if the file was created successfully, and false if the file already exists. If the file cannot be created, an IOException is thrown.\nQuestion: How to check if a file exists in Java?\nPlease using this api: File.exists.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: File.exists\n<<<code>>>: File file = new File(\"file.txt\");\nif (file.exists()) {\n    System.out.println(\"File exists\");\n} else {\n    System.out.println(\"File does not exist\");\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The exists() method of the File class is used to test whether the file or directory denoted by this abstract"}
