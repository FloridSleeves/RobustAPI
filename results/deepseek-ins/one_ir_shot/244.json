Improve this question                    I am writing a back end program that telnets into a server, runs some commands and saves all the output from those commands.  Something just like Expect.I would like to use an open source solution that is well supported and runs with JDK 6.  I have found 3 options so far and would like some help deciding which one (or a better suggestion) to use.commons-net \u2013 This is very well supported but I having trouble getting a simple \u201cLog in and do \u2018ls\u2019\u201d command working.  I would prefer to use this library, if anyone can provide a simple example (and not the example that comes with it that takes input from the user) I would like to go that route.  If I\u2019m unable to use commons-net the next two options are:JExpect \u2013 This is not that hard to use, does what I need but how well supported is it?  Will it work with JDK 6, I think so.Java Telnet Application (jta26) \u2013 This was easy to use but I\u2019m not sure how versatile it is.  I didn\u2019t see any place to set a timeout value in the TelnetWrapper.  I also was not sure if this code is being maintained since the last update to the site was in 2005. (http://www.javassh.org)I know this is somewhat opinion oriented and hope SO is a good place to help me make a decision so I don\u2019t start down one road and find out later it\u2019s not what I\u2019m looking for.

Thanks.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: int read()\n<<<explanation>>>: Reads the next byte of data from the input stream. The value byte is returned as an int in the range 0 to 255. If no byte is available because the end of the stream has been reached, the value -1 is returned. This method blocks until input data is available, the end of the stream is detected, or an exception is thrown.\nQuestion: How can I read a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.readAllBytes.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.readAllBytes\n<<<code>>>: byte[] bytes = Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get(\"path/to/file\"));\n<<<explanation>>>: Reads all bytes from a file into a byte array. The file is specified by a Path. The file is opened and the bytes are read from it. The file is closed when all bytes are read. If the file does not exist, or if it is a directory rather than a regular file, or if an I/O error occurs, the method throws a java.nio.file.NoSuchFileException, a java.nio.file.DirectoryStream.Filter.NOT_A_DIRECTORY exception, or a java.io.IOException.\nQuestion: How can I write to a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.write\n<<<code>>>: Files.write(Paths.get(\"path/to/file\"), \"Hello, World!\".getBytes());\n<<<explanation>>>: Writes bytes to a file. The file is specified by a Path. The file is opened and the bytes are written to it. The file is closed when all bytes are written. If the file does not exist, it is created. If the file does exist, it is truncated to zero size. If the file cannot be opened, or if an I/O error occurs, the method throws a java.nio.file.NoSuchFileException, a java.nio.file.DirectoryStream.Filter.NOT_A_DIRECTORY exception, or a java.io.IOException.\nQuestion: How can I handle exceptions in Java?\nPlease using this api: try-catch-finally.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: try-catch-finally\n<<<code>>>: \ntry {\n    // code that may throw an exception\n} catch (ExceptionType name) {\n    // code to handle the exception\n} finally {\n    // code to be executed regardless of whether an exception occurred\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The try-catch-finally statement is used to handle exceptions in Java. The try block contains the code that might throw an exception. The catch block contains the code to handle the exception. The finally block contains the code to be executed regardless of whether an exception occurred. The try, catch, and finally blocks are used together to handle exceptions.\nQuestion: How can I create a new thread in Java?\nPlease using this api: Thread.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Thread\n<<<code>>>: \nThread thread = new Thread(() -> {\n    // code to be executed in the new thread\n});\nthread.start();\n<<<explanation>>>: The Thread class in Java is used to create a new thread. The new thread is started by calling the start() method. The code to be executed in the new thread is passed to the Thread constructor as a Runnable. The Runnable interface has a single method run() that contains the code to be executed in the new thread.\nQuestion: How can I create a new thread in Java?\nPlease using this api: Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor\n<<<code>>>: \nExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();\nexecutor.execute(() -> {\n    // code to be executed in the new thread\n});\nexecutor.shutdown();\n<<<explanation>>>: The Executors class in Java provides methods to create different types of ExecutorService instances. The newSingleThreadExecutor method creates a new ExecutorService that uses a single worker thread operating off an unbounded queue. The execute method is used to submit tasks for execution. The shutdown method is used to shut down the ExecutorService.\nQuestion: How can I create a new thread in Java?\nPlease using this api: Executors.newFixedThreadPool.\nAn"}
