If the length is 0, the file is empty.\n\n\nA: The code you provided is correct. The method Arrays.stream() is used to create a stream of elements from the array, and the sum() method is used to calculate the sum of these elements.\n\nHere is the code:\nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n\nThe variable sum will now hold the sum of the elements in the array.\n\nFor checking if a file is blank in Android, you can use the length() method of the File class. If the length of the file is 0, then the file is blank.\n\nHere is the code:\nFile file = new File(\"test.txt\");\nif (file.length() == 0) {\n    // File is blank\n} else {\n    // File is not blank\n}\n\nThis code will check if the length of the file \"test.txt\" is 0, and if it is, it will print \"File is blank\". If the length is not 0, it will print \"File is not blank\".\n\nThese are the correct and recommended ways to calculate the sum of an array in Java and to check if a file is blank in Android.\n\nA: You can use Java 8's Stream API to calculate the sum of an array. Here is an example:\n\n```java\nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n```\n\nIn this code, `Arrays.stream(array)` creates a stream of integers from the array. The `sum()` method then calculates the sum of these integers.\n\nFor checking if a file is blank in Android, you can use the `length()` method of the `File` class. Here is an example:\n\n```java\nFile"}
