The returned element is of the type specified by the Iterator's generic type parameter.\nQuestion: What is the difference between the '==' and '===' operators in JavaScript?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: '==' and '==='\n<<<code>>>: \n'==' is a comparison operator that checks if the values of two operands are equal or not. If they are equal, the condition becomes true.\n'===' is a comparison operator that checks both the value and the type of the two operands. If the value and type of the two operands are equal, the condition becomes true.\n<<<explanation>>>: The '==' operator checks for equality of values, while the '===' operator checks for equality of both values and types.\nQuestion: How can I find the maximum value in an array in JavaScript?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Math.max\n<<<code>>>: let array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nlet max = Math.max(...array);\n<<<explanation>>>: The Math.max() function returns the largest of zero or more numbers. The '...' (spread) operator is used to pass the elements of the array as individual arguments to the Math.max() function.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in JavaScript?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: reduce\n<<<code>>>: let array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nlet sum = array.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);\n<<<explanation>>>: The reduce() method executes a reducer function (that you provide) on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value. The reducer function takes four arguments: Accumulator (acc), Current Value (cur), Current Index (idx), and Source Array (src). In this case, we are using it to sum up the elements of the array.\nQuestion: How can I find the maximum value in an array in Python?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: max\n<<<code>>>: array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nmax_value = max(array)\n<<<explanation>>>: The max() function returns the item from the list with maximum value.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Python?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: sum\n<<<code>>>: array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\ntotal = sum(array)\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() function returns the sum of all the elements in the list.\n\n```\n\n## AI's answer\n```\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\n\nQuestion: Why polymorphism does not work as I'd expect in my code?:\nAnswer: The problem in your code is that you are using an Iterator to iterate over the ArrayList of Shape objects. The Iterator.next() method returns the next element in the iteration and does not guarantee that the next element is of the type you expect. In your case, you are adding Circle, Square, and Triangle objects to the ArrayList, but when you call iter.next(), it returns a Shape object, not a specific type of Shape.\n\nTo fix this, you should use a for-each loop to iterate over the ArrayList. The for-each loop automatically determines the type of the elements in the collection, so it will return the correct type of Shape object. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```java\npublic void printShapes(ArrayList<String> numbers){\n    for(String s:numbers){\n        for(Shape shape : this.shapes){\n            shape.printMe(s);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n"}
