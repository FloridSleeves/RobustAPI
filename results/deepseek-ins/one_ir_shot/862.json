This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to append to AES encrypted file: :I'm writing some kind of logger that produces encrypted log-file. Unfortunately, cryptography is not my strong side. Now I can write to file several messages and then close file. Then i can open it, append some messages, close again and after decryption I see padding bytes in the middle of file. Is there any way to work with encrypted file without having to decrypt it every time I want to append some messages?EDIT: little more details. Current implementation utlizes CipherOutputStream. As i understand there's no way to seek using it.Can i use 'NoPadding' option if i will control that output data size is divisible by block size?\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.

The file pointer is then incremented by one. The seek() method of the RandomAccessFile class sets the file-pointer offset, in bytes, from the beginning of this file.\nQuestion: How to convert a string to a byte array in Java?\nPlease using this api: getBytes().\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: getBytes()\n<<<code>>>: String str = \"Hello World\";\nbyte[] byteArray = str.getBytes();\n<<<explanation>>>: The getBytes() method of the String class returns a sequence of bytes that can be used to create a string by using the String constructor that accepts a byte array parameter.\nQuestion: How to convert a byte array to a string in Java?\nPlease using this api: new String().\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: new String()\n<<<code>>>: byte[] byteArray = {72, 101, 108, 108, 111, 32, 87, 111, 114, 108, 100};\nString str = new String(byteArray);\n<<<explanation>>>: The String(byte[] bytes) constructor of the String class creates a new String by decoding the specified array of bytes using the platform's default charset.\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.readAllBytes.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Files.readAllBytes\n<<<code>>>: Path path = Paths.get(\"file.txt\");\nbyte[] data = Files.readAllBytes(path);\n<<<explanation>>>: The readAllBytes method of the Files class returns the contents of the file as a byte array.\nQuestion: How to write to a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.write.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Files.write\n<<<code>>>: Path path = Paths.get(\"file.txt\");\nFiles.write(path, \"Hello, World!\".getBytes());\n<<<explanation>>>: The write method of the Files class writes bytes to a file. If the file does not exist, it is created. If it does exist, it is truncated to zero size.\nQuestion: How to read a file line by line in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.lines.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Files.lines\n<<<code>>>: Path path = Paths.get(\"file.txt\");\nFiles.lines(path).forEach(line -> System.out.println(line));\n<<<explanation>>>: The lines method of the Files class returns a Stream of String lines read from the file. The forEach method of the Stream class performs an action for each element of the stream.\nQuestion: How to convert a List to an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: toArray.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: toArray\n<<<code>>>: List<String> list = Arrays.asList(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\");\nString[] array = list.toArray(new String[0]);\n<<<explanation>>>: The toArray method of the List interface returns an array containing all of the elements in this list in proper sequence (from first to last element). The returned array's runtime type is that of the specified array.\nQuestion: How to convert an array to a List in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.asList.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Arrays.asList\n<<<code>>>: String[] array = {\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"};\nList<String> list = Arrays.asList(array);\n<<<explanation>>>: The asList method of the Arrays class returns a fixed-size list backed by the specified array. The returned list is serializable and its size is fixed.\nQuestion: How to sort a List in Java?\nPlease using this api: Collections.sort.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Collections.sort\n<<<code>>>: List<String> list = Arrays.asList(\"C\", \"B\","}
