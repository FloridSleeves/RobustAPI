In this case, it is used to skip the first element of the tail set.\nQuestion: How can I sort a list of objects by multiple fields using Java 8?\nPlease using this api: Stream.sorted.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Stream.sorted\n<<<code>>>: List<Person> persons = ...;\npersons.stream().sorted(Comparator.comparing(Person::getAge).thenComparing(Person::getName)).collect(Collectors.toList());\n<<<explanation>>>: The sorted() method of the Stream interface returns a stream consisting of the elements of this stream, sorted according to the provided Comparator. In this case, we are sorting the list of persons first by age and then by name. The thenComparing method is used to resolve any ties in the sort.\nQuestion: How can I find the intersection of two lists in Java 8?\nPlease using this api: Stream.filter.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Stream.filter\n<<<code>>>: List<String> list1 = Arrays.asList(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\");\nList<String> list2 = Arrays.asList(\"b\", \"c\", \"d\");\nList<String> intersection = list1.stream().filter(list2::contains).collect(Collectors.toList());\n<<<explanation>>>: The filter() method of the Stream interface returns a stream consisting of the elements of this stream that match the given predicate. In this case, we are filtering list1 to only include elements that are also in list2. The result is a list of the common elements.\nQuestion: How can I find the difference between two lists in Java 8?\nPlease using this api: Stream.distinct.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Stream.distinct\n<<<code>>>: List<String> list1 = Arrays.asList(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\");\nList<String> list2 = Arrays.asList(\"b\", \"c\", \"d\");\nList<String> difference = list1.stream().filter(e -> !list2.contains(e)).collect(Collectors.toList());\n<<<explanation>>>: The filter() method of the Stream interface returns a stream consisting of the elements of this stream that match the given predicate. In this case, we are filtering list1 to only include elements that are not in list2. The result is a list of the elements that are in list1 but not in list2.\nQuestion: How can I find the union of two lists in Java 8?\nPlease using this api: Stream.distinct.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Stream.distinct\n<<<code>>>: List<String> list1 = Arrays.asList(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\");\nList<String> list2 = Arrays.asList(\"b\", \"c\", \"d\");\nList<String> union = Stream.concat(list1.stream(), list2.stream()).distinct().collect(Collectors.toList());\n<<<explanation>>>: The distinct() method of the Stream interface returns a stream consisting of the distinct elements (according to Object.equals(Object)) of this stream. In this case, we are combining list1 and list2 into a single stream, then removing duplicates. The result is a list of all elements that are in either list1 or list2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
