Is there some way of making synchronized writing and reading in the file?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: printWriter.println(\"A took file: \" + file.getName());\n<<<explanation>>>: The println() method in PrintWriter class writes a line terminator after the specified string. The print() method writes the string and then the line separator string.\nQuestion: What is the difference between the \"==\" and \"equals\" operators in Java?\nPlease using this api: == and equals.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: == and equals\n<<<code>>>: int a = 1;\nint b = 1;\nString s1 = new String(\"test\");\nString s2 = new String(\"test\");\n<<<explanation>>>: In Java, \"==\" is a relational operator that compares the references of two objects. It checks whether the two references point to the same memory location or not. On the other hand, \"equals()\" is a method of the Object class that compares the actual content of the objects. It checks whether the two objects are logically equivalent or not.\nQuestion: What is the difference between a static and non-static method in Java?\nPlease using this api: static and non-static methods.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: static and non-static methods\n<<<code>>>: public class Main {\n    static void myMethod() {\n        System.out.println(\"Static method\");\n    }\n\n    void myMethod2() {\n        System.out.println(\"Non-static method\");\n    }\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: In Java, a static method belongs to the class itself and not to any instance of the class. It can be accessed directly by the class name, without creating an instance of the class. Non-static methods, on the other hand, belong to an instance of the class and can only be accessed through an instance of the class.\nQuestion: What is the difference between a static and non-static variable in Java?\nPlease using this api: static and non-static variables.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: static and non-static variables\n<<<code>>>: public class Main {\n    static int x = 10;\n    int y = 20;\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: A static variable is a variable that belongs to the class and not to any instance of the class. It is shared among all instances of the class. Non-static variables, on the other hand, are variables that belong to an instance of the class and are not shared among instances.\nQuestion: What is the difference between a final, finally, and finalize in Java?\nPlease using this api: final, finally, finalize.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: final, finally, finalize\n<<<code>>>: public class Main {\n    final int x = 10;\n    try {\n        // code\n    } finally {\n        // code\n    }\n    protected void finalize() {\n        // code\n    }\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: \"final\" is a keyword in Java that marks a variable or method as \"constant\". Once a final variable is assigned, it cannot be changed. A final method can't be overridden by subclasses. \"finally\" is a keyword in Java used in try-catch blocks. The finally block always executes whether an exception is thrown or not. \"finalize\" is a method in Java that is called by the garbage collector before an object is destroyed. It is used for cleanup purposes.\nQuestion: What is the difference between a checked and unchecked exception in Java?\nPlease using this api: checked and unchecked exceptions.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: checked and unchecked exceptions\n<<<code>>>: public class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        try {\n            throw new Exception(\"Unchecked Exception\");\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            System.out.println(e.getMessage());\n        }\n\n        try {\n            throw new ArithmeticException(\"Checked Exception\");\n        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {\n            System.out.println(e.getMessage());\n        }\n    }\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: Checked exceptions are checked at compile time. They are the ones that are checked by the compiler to ensure that the programmer has handled the exception or declared the method to throw the exception. Unchecked exceptions are not checked at compile time. They are checked at runtime. Examples of unchecked exceptions are ArithmeticException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, Null"}
