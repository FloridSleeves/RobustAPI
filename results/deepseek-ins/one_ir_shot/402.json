This method may be called repeatedly to iterate through the collection, or intermixed with calls to other methods. The behavior of an iterator is unspecified if the underlying collection is modified while the iteration is in progress in any way other than by calling this method.\nQuestion: What is the difference between the two methods of creating a new thread in Java?\nPlease using this api: Thread.start() and Thread.run().\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Thread.start() and Thread.run()\n<<<code>>>: Thread thread = new Thread(new Runnable() {\n    public void run() {\n        // code to be executed in new thread\n    }\n});\nthread.start(); // to start the new thread\nthread.run(); // to run the code in the current thread\n<<<explanation>>>: The start() method of the Thread class starts a new thread of execution. The Java Virtual Machine can schedule this thread to begin execution -- the Java Virtual Machine may allocate a new operating system thread to the new thread, or it may use an existing operating system thread. The new thread then runs the object's run method.\nThe run() method of the Thread class is the code that gets executed when a thread is started. It's the method that gets called when you call start() on a Thread object. The run() method runs in the caller's thread.\n\nA: Question: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nAnswer:\n<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.
