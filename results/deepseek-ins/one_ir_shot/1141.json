This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\n\n\nA: You can use the Arrays.stream API in Java to calculate the sum of an array. Here is an example:\n\n```java\nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\nSystem.out.println(\"The sum of the array is: \" + sum);\n```\n\nIn this code, Arrays.stream(array) creates a stream of integers from the array. The sum() method then calculates the sum of these integers. The result is then printed to the console.\n\nIf you want to calculate the sum of a double array, you can use the same approach but replace int with double:\n\n```java\ndouble[] array = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0};\ndouble sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\nSystem.out.println(\"The sum of the array is: \" + sum);\n```\n\nIn this case, Arrays.stream(array) creates a stream of doubles from the array. The sum() method then calculates the sum of these doubles. The result is then printed to the console.\n\nPlease note that Arrays.stream is available from Java 8 and onwards.\n\nRegarding your question about parsing specific data from a line with a BufferedReader, you can use the StringTokenizer class to split the line into tokens. Here is an example:\n\n```java\nString line = \"100000 Farm 500000.00 101100001 Land 700000.00 104\";\nStringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(line);\nfor (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\n    st.nextToken();\n}\ndouble x = Double.parseDouble(st.nextToken());\nSystem.out.println(\"The third double in the line is: \" + x);\n```\n\nIn this code, StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(line) splits the line into tokens. The for loop skips the first three tokens. The double x = Double.parseDouble(st.nextToken()) then parses the fourth token as a double. The result is then printed to the console.\n\nPlease note that StringTokenizer is a legacy class and it's recommended to use the split method of the String class or the Scanner class for splitting strings into tokens.\n\nI hope this helps you understand how to use the Arrays.stream and StringTokenizer APIs in Java to calculate the sum of an array and parse specific data from a line with a BufferedReader.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
