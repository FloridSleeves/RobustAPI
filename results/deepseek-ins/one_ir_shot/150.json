It returns the total number of bytes read into the buffer.\nQuestion: How to convert byte array to hexadecimal string in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: DatatypeConverter.printHexBinary\n<<<code>>>: String hex = DatatypeConverter.printHexBinary(byteArray);\n<<<explanation>>>: The printHexBinary() method of the DatatypeConverter class converts a byte array into a hexadecimal string.\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileInputStream\n<<<code>>>: FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(\"file.txt\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The FileInputStream class is used to read data from a file. It is part of the java.io package.\nQuestion: How to read a file line by line in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"file.txt\"));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The readLine() method of the BufferedReader class reads a line of text from the input stream. It returns null when there is no more data to read.\nQuestion: How to write to a file in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileOutputStream\n<<<code>>>: FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(\"file.txt\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The FileOutputStream class is used to write data to a file. It is part of the java.io package.\nQuestion: How to write to a file line by line in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.println\n<<<code>>>: PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(\"file.txt\"));\npw.println(\"Hello, World!\");\npw.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The println() method of the PrintWriter class writes a line of text to the output stream.\nQuestion: How to handle exceptions in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: try-catch-finally\n<<<code>>>: \ntry {\n    // code that may throw an exception\n} catch (ExceptionType name) {\n    // code to handle the exception\n} finally {\n    // code to be executed regardless of whether an exception occurred\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The try-catch-finally block is used to handle exceptions in Java. The try block contains the code that may throw an exception. The catch block contains the code to handle the exception. The finally block contains the code to be executed regardless of whether an exception occurred.\n\n\nA: Here is a simple example of how to calculate the sum of an array using Java's Stream API:\n\n```java\nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\nSystem.out.println(sum); // Outputs: 15\n```\n\nIn this example, `Arrays.stream(array)` creates a Stream of integers from the array. The `sum()` method then calculates the sum of these integers.\n\nAs for splitting binary data into hex strings, you can use the `DatatypeConverter.printHexBinary()` method from the `javax.xml.bind.DatatypeConverter` class:\n\n```java\nbyte[] data = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nString hex = DatatypeConverter.printHexBinary(data);\nSystem.out.println(hex); // Outputs: \"0102030405\"\n```\n\nIn this example, `DatatypeConverter.printHexBinary(data)` converts the byte array into a hexadecimal string.\n\nTo read a file in Java, you can use the `FileInputStream` class:\n\n```java\nFileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(\"file.txt\");\n```\n\nTo read a file line by line, you can use the `BufferedReader.readLine()` method:\n"}
