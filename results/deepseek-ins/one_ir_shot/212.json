If the client sends me a byte of value 0, it is not received by the server. The second issue is, if the byte value is 128 or more, I keep receiving a value of 65533 or a binary value of 11111101. Anyone knows how to solve these issues. I am a beginner in networking on JAVA.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.

If no byte is available because the end of the stream has been reached, the value -1 is returned.\nQuestion: How can I convert a string to a byte array in Java?\nPlease using this api: getBytes.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: getBytes\n<<<code>>>: String str = \"Hello, World!\";\nbyte[] byteArray = str.getBytes();\n<<<explanation>>>: The getBytes() method of the String class is used to encode the string into a sequence of bytes using the platform's default charset.\nQuestion: How can I convert a byte array to a string in Java?\nPlease using this api: new String.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: new String\n<<<code>>>: byte[] byteArray = {72, 101, 108, 108, 111};\nString str = new String(byteArray);\n<<<explanation>>>: The new String(byte[] bytes) constructor of the String class is used to create a new String by decoding the specified array of bytes using the platform's default charset.\nQuestion: How can I read a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: FileInputStream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileInputStream\n<<<code>>>: File file = new File(\"path/to/file.txt\");\nFileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(file);\n<<<explanation>>>: The FileInputStream class is used to read data from a file. It is part of the Java I/O package and is used for reading byte-oriented data from a file.\nQuestion: How can I write to a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: FileOutputStream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileOutputStream\n<<<code>>>: File file = new File(\"path/to/file.txt\");\nFileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(file);\n<<<explanation>>>: The FileOutputStream class is used for writing data to a file. It is part of the Java I/O package and is used for writing byte-oriented data to a file.\nQuestion: How can I read from a file in Java using a BufferedReader?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader\n<<<code>>>: File file = new File(\"path/to/file.txt\");\nFileReader fr = new FileReader(file);\nBufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);\n<<<explanation>>>: The BufferedReader class is used to read text from a character-input stream, buffering characters so as to provide for the efficient reading of characters, arrays, and lines.\nQuestion: How can I write to a file in Java using a BufferedWriter?\nPlease using this api: BufferedWriter.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedWriter\n<<<code>>>: File file = new File(\"path/to/file.txt\");\nFileWriter fw = new FileWriter(file);\nBufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(fw);\n<<<explanation>>>: The BufferedWriter class is used for writing character-output to a file, buffering characters so as to provide for the efficient writing of single characters, arrays, and strings.\nQuestion: How can I read from a file in Java using a Scanner?\nPlease using this api: Scanner.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Scanner\n<<<code>>>: File file = new File(\"path/to/file.txt\");\nScanner scanner = new Scanner(file);\n<<<explanation>>>: The Scanner class is used to parse strings, which are interpreted as a sequence of tokens separated by white space. The Scanner class provides methods for parsing primitive types and strings using regular expressions.\nQuestion: How can I write to a file in Java using a PrintWriter?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter\n<<<code>>>: File file = new File(\"path/to/file.txt\");\nPrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(file);\n<<<"}
