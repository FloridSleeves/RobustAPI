The matlab file that I deploy is in fact a matlab function which have no arguments and return a list of integer. I am running that .exe from java code using process to run my executable file. I am tried to read the return values using the following code:            Process process = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(\"epidemic.exe\");            //process.waitFor();            System.out.println(\"....\");            InputStream in = process.getInputStream();  // To read process standard output            InputStream err = process.getErrorStream(); // To read process error output            while (process.isAlive()) {                while (in.available() > 0 || err.available() > 0) {                    if (in.available() > 0) {                        System.out.print((char)in.read()); // You might wanna echo it to your console to see progress                    }                    if (err.available() > 0) {                        err.read(); // You might wanna echo it to your console to see progress                    }                }                Thread.sleep(1);            }           System.out.println(\"....\");EDIT: Based on the proposed changes I re-change my code.

The value byte is returned as an int in the range 0 to 255. If no byte is available because the end of the stream has been reached, the value -1 is returned.\nQuestion: How can I read a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"file.txt\"));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The readLine() method of the BufferedReader class reads a line of text. A line is considered to be terminated by any one of a line feed ('\\n'), a carriage return ('\\r'), or a carriage return followed immediately by a line feed.\nQuestion: How can I write to a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: BufferedWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(\"file.txt\"));\nbw.write(\"Hello, World!\");\nbw.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The write(int c) method of the Writer class writes a single character.
