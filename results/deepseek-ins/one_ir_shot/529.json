It allows duplicate elements and maintains the insertion order. It's an interface and can be implemented by various classes like ArrayList, LinkedList, etc. An array, on the other hand, is a fixed-size data structure that can hold a fixed number of elements of the same type.\nQuestion: What is the difference between a Set and a List in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Set vs List\n<<<code>>>: List<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();\nSet<String> set = new HashSet<String>();\n<<<explanation>>>: A List in Java is an ordered collection of objects. It allows duplicate elements and maintains the insertion order. A Set, on the other hand, is an unordered collection of objects. It does not allow duplicate elements. The Set interface can be implemented by various classes like HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet, etc.\nQuestion: What is the difference between a Queue and a Stack in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Queue vs Stack\n<<<code>>>: Queue<String> queue = new LinkedList<String>();\nStack<String> stack = new Stack<String>();\n<<<explanation>>>: A Queue in Java is a collection of objects that are inserted and removed according to the first-in-first-out (FIFO) principle. It's an interface and can be implemented by various classes like LinkedList, PriorityQueue, etc. A Stack, on the other hand, is a last-in-first-out (LIFO) data structure. It's a part of Java's collection framework and can be implemented by various classes like Vector, Stack, etc.\n\n```\n\n## AI's answer\n```\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nAnswer: Arrays.stream\nCode: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\nExplanation: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\n\nQuestion: Why does the Iterator not \"Move Next\" in a for loop?\nAnswer: Iterator.next\nCode: Iterator<CStick> iterator = testCStickChart.iterator();\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\n    CStick localCStick = iterator.next();\n    System.out.println(localCStick.getEPIC());\n}\nExplanation: The next() method of the Iterator interface returns the next element in the iteration.
