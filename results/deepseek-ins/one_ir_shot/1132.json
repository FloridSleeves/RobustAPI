The nextToken() method returns the next token from the string.\nQuestion: How can I create a graph in Java?\nPlease using this api: graph.addEdge.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: graph.addEdge\n<<<code>>>: graph.addEdge(int source, int destination);\n<<<explanation>>>: The addEdge() method of the Graph class adds an edge to the graph. The source and destination are the vertices of the edge.\nQuestion: How can I read a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"filename.txt\"));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The readLine() method of the BufferedReader class reads a line of text. It returns null if the end of the stream has been reached.\nQuestion: How can I write to a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: BufferedWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(\"filename.txt\"));\nbw.write(\"Hello, World!\");\nbw.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The write() method of the BufferedWriter class writes text to the file. The close() method of the BufferedWriter class closes the output stream, flushing it first.\nQuestion: How can I handle exceptions in Java?\nPlease using this api: try-catch-finally.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: try-catch-finally\n<<<code>>>: \ntry {\n    // code that may throw an exception\n} catch (ExceptionType name) {\n    // code to handle the exception\n} finally {\n    // code to be executed regardless of whether an exception occurred\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The try-catch-finally block in Java is used to handle exceptions. The try block contains the code that may throw an exception. The catch block contains the code to handle the exception. The finally block contains the code to be executed regardless of whether an exception occurred.\nQuestion: How can I check if a file exists in Java?\nPlease using this api: File.exists.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: File.exists\n<<<code>>>: File file = new File(\"filename.txt\");\nif (file.exists()) {\n    System.out.println(\"File exists\");\n} else {\n    System.out.println(\"File does not exist\");\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The exists() method of the File class returns true if the file or directory denoted by this abstract pathname exists; otherwise, false.\n\n\nA: Question: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nAnswer:\n```java\nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n```\n\nQuestion: How can i pass all integers i this loop and stop before the last line:\nAnswer:\n```java\nStringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());\nwhile (st.hasMoreTokens()) {\n    graph.addEdge(Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken()), Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken()));\n}\n```\n\nQuestion: How can I create a graph in Java?\nAnswer:\n```java\ngraph.addEdge(int source, int destination);\n```\n\nQuestion: How can I read a file in Java?\nAnswer:\n```java\nBufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"filename.txt\"));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n```\n\n"}
