The character to be written is given as an integer. This method is overridden in the Writer class and, in doing so, may be called by subclasses.\nQuestion: What is the difference between a List and an Array in Java?\nPlease using this api: List vs Array.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: List vs Array\n<<<code>>>: List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();\nString[] array = new String[5];\n<<<explanation>>>: A List in Java is an ordered collection of elements. It allows duplicate elements and maintains the insertion order. It is an interface and cannot be instantiated directly. It is implemented by various classes like ArrayList, LinkedList, etc.\nOn the other hand, an Array in Java is a fixed-size data structure that can hold a fixed number of elements of the same type. It cannot be resized after its creation. It is a concrete class and can be instantiated directly.\nQuestion: What is the difference between a String and a StringBuilder in Java?\nPlease using this api: String vs StringBuilder.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: String vs StringBuilder\n<<<code>>>: String str = \"Hello\";\nStringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(\"Hello\");\n<<<explanation>>>: A String in Java is an immutable object. Once a String object is created, it cannot be changed. Any operation that appears to change a String, such as concatenation, will actually create a new String.\nOn the other hand, a StringBuilder is a mutable sequence of characters. It is not thread-safe, meaning it is not safe for use by multiple threads concurrently. It is designed for use as a drop-in replacement for StringBuffer in places where the StringBuffer class is being used by a single thread.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
