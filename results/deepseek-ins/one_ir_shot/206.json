It returns the total number of bytes read into the buffer, or -1 if there is no more data because the end of the stream has been reached. This is a good way to compare the contents of two files without loading the entire file into memory.\nQuestion: How to convert a String to a Date in Java?\nPlease using this api: SimpleDateFormat.parse.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: SimpleDateFormat.parse\n<<<code>>>: \nSimpleDateFormat formatter = new SimpleDateFormat(\"dd-MM-yyyy\");\nString dateInString = \"31-08-2014\";\nDate date = formatter.parse(dateInString);\n<<<explanation>>>: The parse() method of the DateFormat class parses text from a string to produce a date.
