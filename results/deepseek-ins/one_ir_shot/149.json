What can I do?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: InputStream inputStream = socket.getInputStream();\n<<<explanation>>>: The getInputStream() method of the Socket class returns an InputStream that reads bytes from this socket. If the socket is closed, then this method will return null. If the socket is still open, then this method will return an InputStream that can be used to read bytes from the socket.\nQuestion: What is the difference between the '==' and 'equals' operators in Java?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: '==' and 'equals'\n<<<code>>>: int a = 5;\nint b = 5;\nString str1 = new String(\"Hello\");\nString str2 = new String(\"Hello\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The '==' operator compares the memory locations of two objects. It checks whether the two references point to the same object or not. If they do, then the result is true. If they don't, then the result is false.\nThe 'equals()' method, on the other hand, is a part of the Object class and is used to compare the actual content of the objects. It checks whether the two objects are logically equivalent or not. If they are, then the result is true. If they aren't, then the result is false.\nIn the given code, a==b will return true because they are pointing to the same memory location. But str1.equals(str2) will return true because they are logically equivalent.\nQuestion: How can I convert a string to an integer in Java?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Integer.parseInt()\n<<<code>>>: String str = \"123\";\nint num = Integer.parseInt(str);\n<<<explanation>>>: The parseInt() method of the Integer class converts the string argument into an integer. It throws a NumberFormatException if the string does not contain a parsable integer.\nQuestion: What is the difference between '==' and 'equals' in Java?\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: '==' and 'equals'\n<<<code>>>: int a = 5;\nint b = 5;\nString str1 = new String(\"Hello\");\nString str2 = new String(\"Hello\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The '==' operator compares the memory locations of two objects.
