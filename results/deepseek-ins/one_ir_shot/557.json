I have following type of HashMapMap<Integer,ArrayList<String> > trainDataSet = new HashMap<Integer, ArrayList<String>>();I would like to shuffle the values in the Map. How would i do it? Following is my attempt:    collections.shuffle(trainDataSet.values());Got an error:    Values cannot be cast to java.util.ListYes this make sense, because my values are in Arraylist not in List. Would it be possible to shuffle collections of arraylist?EDITIf i have following order::key1  [aa,bb,cd]key2  [xx,xy,sfr]Into something likekey1  [xx,xy,sfr]key2  [aa,bb,cd]\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\n\nA: You can use Java 8's Stream API to calculate the sum of an array.

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\n\nTo shuffle values in a HashMap, you can use the entrySet() method to get a Set view of the mappings contained in this map, then use the shuffle() method of the Collections class to shuffle the values:\n\n<<<api>>>: Iterator.next\n<<<code>>>: Iterator<Map.Entry<Integer, ArrayList<String>>> it = trainDataSet.entrySet().iterator();\nwhile (it.hasNext()) {\n    Map.Entry<Integer, ArrayList<String>> pair = it.next();\n    Collections.shuffle(pair.getValue());\n}\n\nThe next() method of the Iterator interface returns the next element in the iteration. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\n\nHowever, you cannot shuffle a collection of ArrayList directly. You need to shuffle each ArrayList separately. The shuffle() method of the Collections class shuffles the elements in a list in place and returns the list.\n\nA: You can use Java 8's Stream API to calculate the sum of an array.
