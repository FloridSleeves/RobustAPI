The Files.write() method writes bytes to a file.\nQuestion: How can I read a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.readAllLines.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.readAllLines\n<<<code>>>: List<String> lines = Files.readAllLines(Paths.get(\"file.txt\"));\n<<<explanation>>>: The readAllLines() method of the Files class returns a list containing all lines read from the specified file.\nQuestion: How can I write to a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.write\n<<<code>>>: Files.write(Paths.get(\"file.txt\"), \"Hello, World!\".getBytes());\n<<<explanation>>>: The write() method of the Files class writes bytes to a file. The Paths.get() method returns a Path object representing the given file path.\nQuestion: How can I create a directory in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.createDirectories.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.createDirectories\n<<<code>>>: Files.createDirectories(Paths.get(\"directory\"));\n<<<explanation>>>: The createDirectories() method of the Files class creates a directory, including any necessary but nonexistent parent directories. The Paths.get() method returns a Path object representing the given directory path.\nQuestion: How can I list all files in a directory in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.list.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.list\n<<<code>>>: Files.list(Paths.get(\"directory\")).forEach(file -> System.out.println(file.getFileName()));\n<<<explanation>>>: The list() method of the Files class returns a stream of file names (Path objects) for the files in the specified directory. The forEach() method applies a consumer to each element of the stream.\nQuestion: How can I check if a file exists in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.exists.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.exists\n<<<code>>>: boolean exists = Files.exists(Paths.get(\"file.txt\"));\n<<<explanation>>>: The exists() method of the Files class tests whether the file or directory denoted by this pathname exists. It returns true if and only if the file or directory exists.\nQuestion: How can I delete a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: Files.delete.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Files.delete\n<<<code>>>: Files.delete(Paths.get(\"file.txt\"));\n<<<explanation>>>: The delete() method of the Files class deletes the file or directory denoted by this pathname. If the file or directory does not exist, then the method does nothing and returns false.\nQuestion: How can I read a file line by line in Java?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader reader = Files.newBufferedReader(Paths.get(\"file.txt\"));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The newBufferedReader() method of the Files class returns a new buffered reader that reads text from the specified path. The readLine() method of the BufferedReader class reads a line of text. It returns null if the end of the stream has been reached.\nQuestion: How can I write to a file line by line in Java?\nPlease using this api: BufferedWriter.newLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedWriter.newLine\n<<<code>>>: BufferedWriter writer = Files.newBufferedWriter(Paths.get(\"file.txt\"));\nwriter.write(\"Hello, World!\");\nwriter.newLine();\nwriter.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The newBufferedWriter() method of the Files class returns a new buffered writer that writes text to the specified path.
