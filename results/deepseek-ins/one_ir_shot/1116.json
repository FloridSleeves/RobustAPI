Improve this question                    I want to convert words containing alphabetical characters into a representative number in Java.  For example, four hundred four should evaluate to the number 404.If the letters are gibberish like asdf then that's an error.I know I can convert bare Characters to their ascii equivalent Integer, appending those together, but I only want the numbers behind the English word phrases extracted.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.
