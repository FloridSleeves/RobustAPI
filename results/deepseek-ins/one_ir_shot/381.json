What if its primitive like int, long, char?\n\nA: You can use the `instanceof` operator to check if the object is an instance of a certain class.\n\nHere is how you can modify your code:\n\n```java\npublic static <T> T createPOJOFrom(Class<T> clazz, Entity source){   \n    T obj = null;\n    if (clazz.isPrimitive()){\n        Map<String,Object> props = source.getProperties();\n        Iterator<Map.Entry<String,Object>> it = props.entrySet().iterator();\n        Object prop = it.next();\n        if(prop instanceof String){\n            obj = (T) prop;\n        } else if(prop instanceof Number){\n            obj = (T) prop;\n        } else if(prop instanceof Boolean){\n            obj = (T) prop;\n        } else if(prop instanceof List){\n            obj = (T) prop;\n        } else if(prop instanceof Map){\n            obj = (T) prop;\n        }\n    } else {\n        obj = createPOJOFrom(clazz, createMapFromEntity(source));\n    }\n    return obj;\n}\n```\n\nThis code will check if the `prop` object is an instance of `String`, `Number`, `Boolean`, `List`, or `Map`. If it is, it will cast `prop` to `T` and assign it to `obj`.\n\nAs for your second question, if `T` is a primitive type, you cannot assign a primitive value to a reference of type `T` directly. You would need to use a wrapper class (like `Integer`, `Long`, `Character`, etc.) for primitives. For example, if `T` is `int`, you would need to cast `prop` to `Integer` before assigning it to `obj`.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```java\nif(prop instanceof Integer){\n    obj = (T) new Integer((Integer)prop);\n}\n```\n\nThis will create a new `Integer` object with the value of `prop` and assign it to `obj`.\n\nPlease note that this code is not safe because it does not handle the case where `prop` is not an instance of the expected class. It also does not handle the case where `T` is a primitive type. You would need to add additional checks and casts for these cases.\n\nAlso, please note that using raw types (Class<T>) is not recommended in Java. You should use type parameters instead.\n\nHere is an example of how you can modify your code to use type parameters:\n\n```java\npublic static <T> T createPOJOFrom(Class<T> clazz, Entity source){   \n    T obj = null;\n    if (clazz.isPrimitive()){\n        Map<String,Object> props = source.getProperties();\n        Iterator<Map.Entry<String,Object>> it = props.entrySet().iterator();\n        Object prop = it.next();\n        if(prop instanceof String){\n            obj = (T) prop;\n        } else if(prop instanceof Number){\n            obj = (T) prop;\n        } else if(prop instanceof Boolean){\n            obj = (T) prop;\n        } else if(prop instanceof List){\n            obj = (T) prop;\n        } else if(prop instanceof Map){\n            obj = (T) prop;\n        }\n    } else {\n        obj = createPOJOFrom(clazz, createMapFromEntity(source));\n    }\n    return obj;\n}\n```\n\nThis code will work with any type `T`, including primitives and generic types.\n\nPlease note that this code is not safe because it does not"}
