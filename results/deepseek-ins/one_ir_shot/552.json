The Hashtable.values() method returns a Collection of Objects, not longs. You should be able to safely cast each Object in the Collection to a long.\nHere is the corrected code:\nHashtable<String, Long> table = new Hashtable<>();\nCollection<Long> values = table.values();\nIterator<Long> itr = values.iterator();\nlong a = itr.next();\n\nIn this code, itr.next() returns a Long object, which can be safely cast to a long.\n\nA: You are getting an error because you are trying to cast an object to a long.
