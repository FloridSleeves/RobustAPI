This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Fetching Application info By using its package name: :I am developing an Android application wherein I am trying to check whether an application has been already installed in the device or not. I am fetching the application info using below code. For example to check whether google maps is installed or not, I am using its package name as shown below.         ApplicationInfo info1 = getPackageManager().        getApplicationInfo(\"com.google.android.apps.maps\", 0 );My question is , if at all this package name is changed by google in future, I will have to update the package name and then send an update to users... Other than checking from package name - Is there any other way to get to know if an application is installed or not? Kindly Help!

Thanks!  \nPlease using this api: ApplicationInfo.loadIcon.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: ApplicationInfo.loadIcon\n<<<code>>>: PackageManager pm = getPackageManager();\ntry {\n    ApplicationInfo info = pm.getApplicationInfo(\"com.google.android.apps.maps\", 0);\n    Drawable icon = info.loadIcon(pm);\n} catch (PackageManager.NameNotFoundException e) {\n    // Application is not installed.\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The loadIcon() method of the ApplicationInfo class returns a Drawable object that represents the icon of the application. This method throws a NameNotFoundException if the application is not found.\nQuestion: How to get the current date and time in Java?\nPlease using this api: java.time.LocalDateTime.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: java.time.LocalDateTime\n<<<code>>>: LocalDateTime now = LocalDateTime.now();\nSystem.out.println(now);\n<<<explanation>>>: The now() method of the LocalDateTime class returns the current date and time. This is a static factory method that obtains the current date and time from the system clock.\nQuestion: How to sort a list of integers in descending order in Java?\nPlease using this api: Collections.sort.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Collections.sort\n<<<code>>>: List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(5, 2, 1, 4, 3);\nCollections.sort(list, Collections.reverseOrder());\nSystem.out.println(list);\n<<<explanation>>>: The sort() method of the Collections class sorts the specified list into ascending order. The second argument is a Comparator that defines the sort order. The reverseOrder() method returns a comparator that imposes the reverse of the natural ordering on a collection of objects.\nQuestion: How to read a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: java.nio.file.Files.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: java.nio.file.Files\n<<<code>>>: Path path = Paths.get(\"file.txt\");\nList<String> lines = Files.readAllLines(path);\nfor (String line : lines) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The readAllLines() method of the Files class returns a list containing all lines of the specified file. Each line is a string in the list.\nQuestion: How to write to a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: java.nio.file.Files.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: java.nio.file.Files\n<<<code>>>: Path path = Paths.get(\"file.txt\");\nList<String> lines = Arrays.asList(\"Line 1\", \"Line 2\", \"Line 3\");\nFiles.write(path, lines);\n<<<explanation>>>: The write() method of the Files class writes the specified lines to the specified file. If the file does not exist, it is created. If the file exists, it is truncated to zero length.\nQuestion: How to create a directory in Java?\nPlease using this api: java.nio.file.Files.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: java.nio.file.Files\n<<<code>>>: Path path = Paths.get(\"directory\");\nFiles.createDirectory(path);\n<<<explanation>>>: The createDirectory() method of the Files class creates a new directory. If the directory already exists, it throws an IOException.\nQuestion: How to list all files in a directory in Java?\nPlease using this api: java.nio.file.Files.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: java.nio.file.Files\n<<<code>>>: Path path = Paths.get(\"directory\");\nDirectoryStream<Path> stream = Files.newDirectoryStream(path);\nfor (Path file : stream) {\n    System.out.println(file.getFileName());\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The newDirectoryStream() method of the Files class returns a DirectoryStream for the specified directory. The DirectoryStream provides an iterator over the entries in the directory.\nQuestion: How to delete a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: java.nio.file.Files.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: java.nio.file.Files\n<<<code>>>: Path path = Paths.get(\"file.txt\");\nFiles.delete(path);\n<<<"}
