I want to create a library using JSch from some other apps I am looking to write.

It returns an integer value which is the byte read or -1 if the end of the stream is reached.\nQuestion: How can I read a line from an InputStream in Java?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: String line = bufferedReader.readLine();\n<<<explanation>>>: The readLine() method of the BufferedReader class is used to read a line of text. It returns a String containing the contents of the line, not including any line-termination characters, or null if the end of the stream has been reached.\nQuestion: How can I convert a String to an Integer in Java?\nPlease using this api: Integer.parseInt.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Integer.parseInt\n<<<code>>>: int number = Integer.parseInt(\"123\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The parseInt() method of the Integer class is used to convert a String to an int. It throws NumberFormatException if the String does not contain a parsable integer.\nQuestion: How can I convert an Integer to a String in Java?\nPlease using this api: Integer.toString.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Integer.toString\n<<<code>>>: String string = Integer.toString(123);\n<<<explanation>>>: The toString() method of the Integer class is used to convert an int to a String.\nQuestion: How can I convert a String to a Character in Java?\nPlease using this api: String.charAt.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: String.charAt\n<<<code>>>: char character = \"Hello\".charAt(0);\n<<<explanation>>>: The charAt() method of the String class is used to get the character at the specified index in the string. The index is zero-based.\nQuestion: How can I convert a Character to a String in Java?\nPlease using this api: Character.toString.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Character.toString\n<<<code>>>: String string = Character.toString('c');\n<<<explanation>>>: The toString() method of the Character class is used to convert a char to a String.\nQuestion: How can I convert a String to a Character Array in Java?\nPlease using this api: String.toCharArray.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: String.toCharArray\n<<<code>>>: char[] array = \"Hello\".toCharArray();\n<<<explanation>>>: The toCharArray() method of the String class is used to convert a String to a char array.\nQuestion: How can I convert a Character Array to a String in Java?\nPlease using this api: new String(char[]).\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: new String(char[])\n<<<code>>>: String string = new String(new char[]{'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'});\n<<<explanation>>>: The String(char[]) constructor of the String class is used to create a new String by copying the characters from a char array.\nQuestion: How can I convert a String to a byte array in Java?\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: String.getBytes\n<<<code>>>: byte[] array = \"Hello\".getBytes();\n<<<explanation>>>: The getBytes() method of the String class is used to encode the string into a sequence of bytes using the platform's default charset.\nQuestion: How can I convert a byte array to a String in Java?\nPlease using this api: new String(byte[]).\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: new String(byte[])\n<<<code>>>: String string = new String(new byte[]{72, 101, 108, 108, 111});\n<<<explanation>>>: The String(byte[]) constructor of the String class is used to create a new String by decoding the specified array of bytes using the platform's default charset.\nQuestion: How can I convert a String to a byte array in Java?\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: String.get"}
