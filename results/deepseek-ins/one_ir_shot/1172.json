In this case, we are using it twice to get the country code. The first call to nextToken() is to remove the \"+\" sign and the second call to nextToken() is to get the country code.\nQuestion: How to get the last element of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint lastElement = Arrays.stream(array).reduce((first, second) -> second).orElse(0);\n<<<explanation>>>: The reduce() method of the Stream interface is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation. It returns an Optional describing the reduced value, if any. In this case, we are using it to get the last element of the array. The lambda function (first, second) -> second is used to get the last element.\nQuestion: How to get the first element of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint firstElement = Arrays.stream(array).findFirst().orElse(0);\n<<<explanation>>>: The findFirst() method of the Stream interface returns an Optional describing the first element of this stream, or an empty Optional if the stream is empty. This is a short-circuiting terminal operation. If the stream is not empty, this operation will always return immediately.\n\n\nA: You can use the Arrays.stream() method to create a Stream from the array, and then use the findFirst() method to get the first element of the Stream. If the Stream is empty, the orElse() method will return the default value you provided (in this case, 0).\n\nHere is the code:\nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint firstElement = Arrays.stream(array).findFirst().orElse(0);\n\nIn this code, firstElement will be 1, which is the first element of the array.\n\nPlease note that the findFirst() method is a short-circuiting terminal operation, meaning it will stop processing as soon as it finds the first element. This can make it more efficient than other operations that process the entire Stream.\n\nAlso, if you want to get the last element of an array, you can use the reduce() method with a lambda function that always returns the last element:\n\nHere is the code:\nint[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint lastElement = Arrays.stream(array).reduce((first, second) -> second).orElse(0);\n\nIn this code, lastElement will be 5, which is the last element of the array.\n\nThe reduce() method applies a binary operator to all elements of the Stream. In this case, the lambda function (first, second) -> second always returns the second element, effectively ignoring the first and only keeping the last.\n\nPlease note that the reduce() method is a terminal operation and it returns an Optional. If the Stream is empty, the orElse() method will return the default value you provided (in this case, 0).\n\nI hope this helps you understand how to use the Arrays.stream() method in Java to get the first and last elements of an array.\n\nA: You can use the Arrays.stream() method to create a Stream from the array, and then use the findFirst() method to get the first element of the Stream.
