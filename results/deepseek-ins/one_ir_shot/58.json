This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\n\n\nA: The problem is that you are trying to use the contains method on a BufferedReader, which does not have such a method. You should use the readLine method to read the lines of the file and then check if the line contains the input info.\n\nHere is the corrected code:\n\n```java\nBufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"data.txt\"));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    if (line.contains(inputinfo)) {\n        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null,\"you will recieve \"+inputamount+\"$\");\n    }\n}\nbr.close();\n```\n\nThis code reads each line of the file until there are no more lines to read (when readLine returns null). If a line contains the input info, it shows a message dialog saying that the user will receive the amount. After all lines have been read, it closes the BufferedReader.\n\nPlease note that you should handle the IOException that can be thrown by the close method.\n\n```java\nBufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"data.txt\"));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    if (line.contains(inputinfo)) {\n        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null,\"you will recieve \"+inputamount+\"$\");\n    }\n}\ntry {\n    br.close();\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n```\n\nThis code will print the stack trace of the exception if it occurs.\n\nAlso, please note that the contains method is case sensitive. If you want to ignore the case, you can use the containsIgnoreCase method.\n\n```java\nif (line.toLowerCase().contains(inputinfo.toLowerCase())) {\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nThis code converts the line and the input info to lower case before checking if the line contains the input info.\n\nI hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>"}
