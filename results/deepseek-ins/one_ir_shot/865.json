Unfortunately, cryptography is not my strong side. Now I can write to file several messages and then close file. Then i can open it, append some messages, close again and after decryption I see padding bytes in the middle of file. Is there any way to work with encrypted file without having to decrypt it every time I want to append some messages?EDIT: little more details. Current implementation utlizes CipherOutputStream. As i understand there's no way to seek using it.Can i use 'NoPadding' option if i will control that output data size is divisible by block size?\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.write.\nAnswer:", "response": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.

The write() method writes the specified byteArray to the file.\nQuestion: How to get the last element of a list in Java 8?\nPlease using this api: List.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: List.stream\n<<<code>>>: List<String> list = Arrays.asList(\"one\", \"two\", \"three\");\nString lastElement = list.stream().reduce((first, second) -> second).get();\n<<<explanation>>>: The reduce() method is a special case of a reduction. It returns an Optional describing the reduced value, if any. The get() method returns the value described by this Optional.\nQuestion: How to convert a List of Integers to an array of ints in Java?\nPlease using this api: Stream.toArray.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Stream.toArray\n<<<code>>>: List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);\nint[] array = list.stream().mapToInt(Integer::intValue).toArray();\n<<<explanation>>>: The mapToInt() method returns an IntStream consisting of the results of applying the given function to the elements of this stream. The toArray() method returns an array containing the elements of this stream.\nQuestion: How to convert a List of Strings to an array of Strings in Java?\nPlease using this api: Stream.toArray.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Stream.toArray\n<<<code>>>: List<String> list = Arrays.asList(\"one\", \"two\", \"three\");\nString[] array = list.stream().toArray(String[]::new);\n<<<explanation>>>: The toArray() method returns an array containing the elements of this stream. The String[]::new is a constructor reference that creates a new array of the specified length.\nQuestion: How to convert a List of Objects to an array of Objects in Java?\nPlease using this api: Stream.toArray.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Stream.toArray\n<<<code>>>: List<Object> list = Arrays.asList(new Object(), new Object());\nObject[] array = list.stream().toArray(Object[]::new);\n<<<explanation>>>: The toArray() method returns an array containing the elements of this stream. The Object[]::new is a constructor reference that creates a new array of the specified length.\n\n\nA: Here are the answers:\n\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\n\nAnswer:\n<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.
