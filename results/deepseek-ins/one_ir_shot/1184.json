This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\n\n\nA: Your code is correct, you are using the correct API to calculate the sum of an array in Java. Here is the explanation of your code:\n\n<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\n\nIn this code, Arrays.stream() is used to convert the array into a Stream. The sum() method is then called on this Stream to calculate the sum of its elements. The result is stored in the variable 'sum'.\n\nPlease note that Arrays.stream() is available from Java 8 onwards. If you are using an older version of Java, you will need to use a different approach to calculate the sum of an array.\n\nAlso, ensure that the file \"test.in.txt\" is in the same directory as your Java class file. If it's not, you'll need to provide the full path to the file in the FileReader constructor.\n\nLastly, make sure that the file \"test.in.txt\" exists and is not empty. If it's empty, the readLine() method will return null.\n\nI hope this helps clarify your question. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.\n\nA: Your code is correct. The issue might be with the file path or the file itself.\nHere is the code:\n```\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class test {\n    public static void main (String [] args) throws IOException {\n        BufferedReader f = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"test.in.txt\"));\n        PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(\"test.out.txt\")));\n        StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(f.readLine());\n        int i1 = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken()); \n        int i2 = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken()); \n        out.println(i1+i2); \n        out.close(); \n    }\n}\n```\n\nHere are some things you can check:\n\n1. Make sure the file \"test.in.txt\" is in the same directory as your Java class file. If it's not, you'll need to provide the full path to the file in the FileReader constructor.\n\n2. Make sure the file \"test.in.txt\" exists and is not empty. If it's empty, the readLine() method will return null.\n\n3. Make sure you have the necessary read/write permissions for the file.\n\n4. Check if the file \"test.out.txt\" is being created in the same directory as your Java class file. If it's not, you'll need to provide the full path to the file in the FileWriter constructor.\n\nIf you're still having issues, please provide more details about the error message you're seeing.\n\nA: The issue might be due to the file not being in the same directory as your Java class file. \n\n*\n\n*Check if the file \"test.in.txt\" is in the same directory as your Java class file.\n\n*If it's not, you'll need to provide the full path to the file in"}
