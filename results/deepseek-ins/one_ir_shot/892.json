It turns out there is not always a silver bullet, especially as this would be a very small rabbit to kill with it.\nPlease using this api: SortedMap.firstKey.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: SortedMap.firstKey\n<<<code>>>: Map.Entry<A, B> entry = map.entrySet().iterator().next();\nA key = entry.getKey();\nB value = entry.getValue();\n<<<explanation>>>: The firstKey() method of the SortedMap interface returns the first (lowest-valued) key in this map. The entrySet() method returns a set view of the mappings contained in this map. The iterator() method returns an iterator over the elements in this set. The next() method returns the next element in the iteration. The getKey() and getValue() methods of the Entry interface return the key and value of this entry.\nQuestion: How to get the last element of a list in Java?\nPlease using this api: List.get.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: List.get\n<<<code>>>: List<String> list = Arrays.asList(\"one\", \"two\", \"three\");\nString lastElement = list.get(list.size() - 1);\n<<<explanation>>>: The get() method of the List interface returns the element at the specified position in this list. The size() method of the List interface returns the number of elements in this list.\nQuestion: How to convert a List to an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: List.toArray.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: List.toArray\n<<<code>>>: List<String> list = Arrays.asList(\"one\", \"two\", \"three\");\nString[] array = list.toArray(new String[0]);\n<<<explanation>>>: The toArray() method of the List interface returns an array containing all of the elements in this list in proper sequence (from first to last element). The size of the returned array is the same as the size of this list. The toArray(T[] a) method of the List interface returns an array containing all of the elements in this list in proper sequence (from first to last element). The returned array has the runtime type that is the same as the runtime type of the specified array, or the runtime type of the specified array if it is big enough.\nQuestion: How to sort a List in Java?\nPlease using this api: Collections.sort.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Collections.sort\n<<<code>>>: List<String> list = Arrays.asList(\"one\", \"two\", \"three\");\nCollections.sort(list);\n<<<explanation>>>: The sort() method of the Collections class sorts the specified list into ascending order. The sort() method uses the natural ordering of its elements, or the order specified by a Comparator.\nQuestion: How to reverse a List in Java?\nPlease using this api: Collections.reverse.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Collections.reverse\n<<<code>>>: List<String> list = Arrays.asList(\"one\", \"two\", \"three\");\nCollections.reverse(list);\n<<<explanation>>>: The reverse() method of the Collections class reverses the order of the elements in the specified list. The first element becomes the last element, the second element becomes the second to last element, and so on.\nQuestion: How to remove duplicates from a List in Java?\nPlease using this api: new LinkedHashSet.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: new LinkedHashSet\n<<<code>>>: List<String> list = Arrays.asList(\"one\", \"two\", \"one\", \"three\", \"two\");\nList<String> listWithoutDuplicates = new ArrayList<>(new LinkedHashSet<>(list));\n<<<explanation>>>: The LinkedHashSet class represents a set backed by a LinkedHashMap. The elements in the set are ordered as they were inserted into the set. The LinkedHashSet class provides all of the optional set operations and permits null elements. The HashSet class makes no guarantees about the iteration order.\nQuestion: How to find the maximum value in a List in Java?\nPlease using this api: Collections.max.\nAnswer: <<<api>>>: Collections.max\n<<<code>>>: List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);\nint max = Collections.max(list);\n<<<explanation>>>: The max() method of the Collections class returns the maximum element in the specified collection. The maximum element is determined by the natural ordering of its elements.\nQuestion"}
