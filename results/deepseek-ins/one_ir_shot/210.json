Returns the next byte of data, or -1 if the end of the stream is reached. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I read a file in Java line by line?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    // process line\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The readLine() method of the BufferedReader class reads a line of text. It returns null if the end of the stream has been reached. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I write to a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: FileWriter.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileWriter\n<<<code>>>: FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(file);\nwriter.write(\"Some text\");\nwriter.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The write() method of the Writer class writes text to the file. The close() method of the Writer class closes the stream, flushing it first. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I append to a file in Java?\nPlease using this api: FileWriter.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileWriter\n<<<code>>>: FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(file, true);\nwriter.write(\"Some text\");\nwriter.close();\n<<<explanation>>>: The FileWriter constructor with a boolean parameter allows you to specify whether to append to the file or not. If true, then the text will be appended to the file. If false, then the text will overwrite the file. The close() method of the Writer class closes the stream, flushing it first. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I read a file in Java byte by byte?\nPlease using this api: FileInputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileInputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(file);\nint read = fis.read();\nwhile (read != -1) {\n    // process byte\n    read = fis.read();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The read() method of the InputStream class reads the next byte of data from the input stream. Returns the next byte of data, or -1 if the end of the stream is reached. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I read a file in Java character by character?\nPlease using this api: FileReader.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileReader.read\n<<<code>>>: FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);\nint read = reader.read();\nwhile (read != -1) {\n    // process character\n    read = reader.read();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The read() method of the Reader class reads a single character. It returns the character read, or -1 if the end of the stream has been reached. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I read a file in Java line by line using BufferedReader?\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: BufferedReader.readLine\n<<<code>>>: BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file));\nString line;\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    // process line\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The readLine() method of the BufferedReader class reads a line of text. It returns null if the end of the stream has been reached. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I read a file in Java using a specific encoding?\nPlease using this api: FileReader.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileReader\n<<<code>>>: FileReader reader = new FileReader(file, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);\n<<<explanation"}
