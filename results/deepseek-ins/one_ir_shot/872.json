The parameters are the table name, the columns to return, the where clause, the where arguments, the group by clause, the having clause, and the order by clause. In this case, we are selecting the ID column from the Word table where the word_group_id is equal to the given id.\nQuestion: How to create a custom list view in Android?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: ArrayAdapter, ListView\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nString[] fruits = {\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Cherry\", \"Date\", \"Elderberry\"};\nArrayAdapter<String> adapter = new ArrayAdapter<String>(this, android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1, fruits);\nListView listView = findViewById(R.id.listView);\nlistView.setAdapter(adapter);\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: In Android, a ListView is a view that can display a list of items. The ArrayAdapter is a class that helps in populating the ListView with data. The constructor of ArrayAdapter takes in the context of the activity, the layout to be used for each item in the list, and the array of data to be displayed. The layout.simple_list_item_1 is a standard layout provided by Android that displays one text view.\nQuestion: How to create a custom adapter in Android?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: ArrayAdapter, BaseAdapter\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\npublic class CustomAdapter extends ArrayAdapter<String> {\n    public CustomAdapter(Context context, String[] words) {\n        super(context, R.layout.custom_row, words);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {\n        LayoutInflater inflater = LayoutInflater.from(getContext());\n        View customView = inflater.inflate(R.layout.custom_row, parent, false);\n\n        String word = getItem(position);\n        TextView textView = customView.findViewById(R.id.textView);\n        textView.setText(word);\n\n        return customView;\n    }\n}\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: A custom adapter is an adapter that you create yourself. It is a class that extends ArrayAdapter or BaseAdapter. The getView() method is where you inflate the custom layout for each item in the list and set the data for each item. The LayoutInflater is used to inflate the custom layout. The convertView parameter is used to recycle old views when scrolling. If it's null, a new view is inflated. If it's not null, the existing view is reused.\nQuestion: How to create a custom dialog in Android?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: AlertDialog.Builder\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nAlertDialog.Builder builder = new AlertDialog.Builder(this);\nbuilder.setTitle(\"Custom Dialog\");\nbuilder.setMessage(\"This is a custom dialog.\");\nbuilder.setPositiveButton(\"OK\", new DialogInterface.OnClickListener() {\n    @Override\n    public void onClick(DialogInterface dialog, int which) {\n        // Handle positive button click\n    }\n});\nAlertDialog dialog = builder.create();\ndialog.show();\n```\n<<<explanation>>>: The AlertDialog.Builder class is used to create a custom dialog. You can set the title, message, and buttons of the dialog. The setPositiveButton() method sets the positive button of the dialog. The onClick() method is called when the positive button is clicked. The create() method is used to create the dialog and the show() method is used to display the dialog.\nQuestion: How to create a custom toast in Android?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Toast\n<<<code>>>: \n```java\nToast toast = Toast.makeText(this, \"This is a custom toast\", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT);\ntoast.show();\n```"}
