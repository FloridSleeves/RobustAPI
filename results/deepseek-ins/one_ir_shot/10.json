They are used to declare a type that can have a certain set of predefined constants. You can't instantiate them.

They are used to declare a type that can have a certain set of predefined constants. You can't instantiate them. Instead, you can use a class or a static field to hold the EditTexts.\n\nYou can initialize EditTexts in your activity class and then assign them to the enum values. Here is an example:\n\n```java\npublic class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {\n    enum Edits {\n        one, two;\n        private EditText editText;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n\n        EditText one = findViewById(R.id.one);\n        EditText two = findViewById(R.id.two);\n\n        Edits.one.setEditText(one);\n        Edits.two.setEditText(two);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the EditTexts with the id \"one\" and \"two\" are initialized in the onCreate() method of the MainActivity class. Then, the EditTexts are assigned to the enum values Edits.one and Edits.two.\n\nNow, you can access the EditTexts in your enum values like this:\n\n```java\nEditText editText = Edits.one.getEditText();\n```\n\nThis will return the EditText associated with the enum value Edits.one.\n\nPlease note that you need to replace `R.id.one` and `R.id.two` with the actual ids of your EditTexts in your layout file.\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>\n<|EOT|>"}
