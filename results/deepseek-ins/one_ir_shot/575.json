In this case, it returns the next ImageReader that supports the \"tiff\" format.\nQuestion: How can I convert a string to an integer in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Integer.parseInt\n<<<code>>>: int i = Integer.parseInt(\"123\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The parseInt() method of the Integer class parses the string argument as a signed decimal integer. This is a static method, so it can be called without creating an Integer object.\nQuestion: How can I convert a string to a float in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Float.parseFloat\n<<<code>>>: float f = Float.parseFloat(\"123.45\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The parseFloat() method of the Float class parses the string argument as a floating-point number. This is a static method, so it can be called without creating a Float object.\nQuestion: How can I convert a string to a double in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Double.parseDouble\n<<<code>>>: double d = Double.parseDouble(\"123.456\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The parseDouble() method of the Double class parses the string argument as a double. This is a static method, so it can be called without creating a Double object.\nQuestion: How can I convert a string to a boolean in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Boolean.parseBoolean\n<<<code>>>: boolean b = Boolean.parseBoolean(\"true\");\n<<<explanation>>>: The parseBoolean() method of the Boolean class parses the string argument as a boolean. This is a static method, so it can be called without creating a Boolean object.\nQuestion: How can I convert an integer to a string in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Integer.toString\n<<<code>>>: String s = Integer.toString(123);\n<<<explanation>>>: The toString() method of the Integer class returns a String object representing the specified integer. This is a static method, so it can be called without creating an Integer object.\nQuestion: How can I convert a float to a string in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Float.toString\n<<<code>>>: String s = Float.toString(123.45f);\n<<<explanation>>>: The toString() method of the Float class returns a String object representing the specified float. This is a static method, so it can be called without creating a Float object.\nQuestion: How can I convert a double to a string in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Double.toString\n<<<code>>>: String s = Double.toString(123.456);\n<<<explanation>>>: The toString() method of the Double class returns a String object representing the specified double. This is a static method, so it can be called without creating a Double object.\nQuestion: How can I convert a boolean to a string in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Boolean.toString\n<<<code>>>: String s = Boolean.toString(true);\n<<<explanation>>>: The toString() method of the Boolean class returns a String object representing the specified boolean. This is a static method, so it can be called without creating a Boolean object.\n\n```\n\n## AI's answer\n```\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.
