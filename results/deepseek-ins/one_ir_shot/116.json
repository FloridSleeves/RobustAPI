I have to send messages to a server to receive the data that I need. There is a field after the message's header which is \"Length\": The length is the total number of bytes in the payload, which includes  all instances of the Param and Delim fields and excludes the header  and framing characters. The length is a 4-byte unsigned long in  network order (big endian).The only two examples in the documentation are these:if payload is 5022=LoginUser|5028=abc|5029=def|5026=1the length field is <0x00><0x00><0x00><0x27>if payload is 5022=Subscribe|4=558|5026=2the length field is <0x00><0x00><0x00><0x1B>I've tried some approaches without success.

The bytes are encoded in the platform's default charset.\nQuestion: How can I convert a byte array to a string in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: new String()\n<<<code>>>: byte[] byteArray = {72, 101, 108, 108, 111, 44, 32, 87, 111, 114, 108, 100, 33};\nString str = new String(byteArray);\n<<<explanation>>>: The String(byte[] bytes) constructor creates a new String by decoding the specified array of bytes using the platform's default charset.\nQuestion: How can I convert a byte array to an integer in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: ByteBuffer.wrap()\n<<<code>>>: byte[] byteArray = {0, 0, 0, 10};\nint num = ByteBuffer.wrap(byteArray).getInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The getInt() method of the ByteBuffer class gets the int from this buffer's current position, and then increments the position by 4. This function is a special case of a get method.\nQuestion: How can I convert an integer to a byte array in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: ByteBuffer.allocate()\n<<<code>>>: int num = 10;\nbyte[] byteArray = ByteBuffer.allocate(4).putInt(num).array();\n<<<explanation>>>: The putInt() method of the ByteBuffer class puts the int argument into this buffer at the current position, and then increments the position by 4. The array() method of the ByteBuffer class returns the byte array containing the bytes of this buffer.\nQuestion: How can I convert a byte array to a long in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: ByteBuffer.wrap()\n<<<code>>>: byte[] byteArray = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 10};\nlong num = ByteBuffer.wrap(byteArray).getLong();\n<<<explanation>>>: The getLong() method of the ByteBuffer class gets the long from this buffer's current position, and then increments the position by 8. This function is a special case of a get method.\nQuestion: How can I convert a long to a byte array in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: ByteBuffer.allocate()\n<<<code>>>: long num = 10L;\nbyte[] byteArray = ByteBuffer.allocate(8).putLong(num).array();\n<<<explanation>>>: The putLong() method of the ByteBuffer class puts the long argument into this buffer at the current position, and then increments the position by 8. The array() method of the ByteBuffer class returns the byte array containing the bytes of this buffer.\nQuestion: How can I convert a byte array to a float in Java?\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: ByteBuffer.wrap()\n<<<code>>>: byte[] byteArray = {63, -1, -1, -1};\nfloat num = ByteBuffer.wrap(byteArray).getFloat();\n<<<explanation>>>: The getFloat() method of the ByteBuffer class gets the float from this buffer's current position, and then increments the position by 4.
