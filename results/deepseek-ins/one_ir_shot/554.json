What's the purpose?My second question is how to remove an item from this Comparable array. I have wrote the removeMin method, I have found the item, I named the variable \"min\", how do I go on and remove this min item from the arrayList?

When you declare a class to implement Comparable, you are promising that the objects of that class will have a natural ordering.\n\nIn your Bag class, you are saying that the objects of this class will have a natural ordering. This means that you can compare two objects of this class and determine which one is smaller, equal or larger than the other.\n\nIn your removeMin method, you are finding the minimum element in the Bag. After finding the minimum element, you want to remove it from the Bag.\n\nUnfortunately, Java does not provide a"}
