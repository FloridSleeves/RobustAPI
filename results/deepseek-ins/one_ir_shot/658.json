Thanks in advance.\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Map.get\n<<<code>>>: Map<String, A> map = new HashMap<>();\nmap.put(\"a1\", new A(\"a1\"));\nmap.put(\"a2\", new A(\"a2\"));\nmap.put(\"a3\", new A(\"a3\"));\nA a = map.get(name);\n<<<explanation>>>: The get() method of the Map interface returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or null if this map contains no mapping for the key.\nQuestion: How can I sort a list of objects in Java?\nPlease using this api: Collections.sort.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Collections.sort\n<<<code>>>: List<Object> list = new ArrayList<>();\nCollections.sort(list);\n<<<explanation>>>: The sort() method of the Collections class sorts the specified list into ascending order. The sort is not stable, i.e., equal elements may not preserve their relative order. The specified list is sorted using its iterator, which must be able to return the elements in their natural order. The specified comparator is used to compare elements in the list.\nQuestion: How can I find the maximum value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint max = Arrays.stream(array).max().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The max() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalInt that represents the maximum element of this stream. If the stream is empty, the result is an empty Optional. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation. The getAsInt() method returns the value of the OptionalInt, or throws NoSuchElementException if the OptionalInt is empty.\nQuestion: How can I find the minimum value in an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint min = Arrays.stream(array).min().getAsInt();\n<<<explanation>>>: The min() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalInt that represents the minimum element of this stream. If the stream is empty, the result is an empty Optional. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation. The getAsInt() method returns the value of the OptionalInt, or throws NoSuchElementException if the OptionalInt is empty.\nQuestion: How can I find the average of an array in Java?\nPlease using this api: Arrays.stream.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\ndouble average = Arrays.stream(array).average().getAsDouble();\n<<<explanation>>>: The average() method of the IntStream class returns an OptionalDouble that represents the average of the elements of this stream. If the stream is empty, the result is an empty Optional. This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation. The getAsDouble() method returns the value of the OptionalDouble, or throws NoSuchElementException if the OptionalDouble is empty.\n\n\nA: Here is the answer:\n\nQuestion: How can I calculate the sum of an array in Java?\nAnswer: Arrays.stream\n<<<code>>>: int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nint sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();\n<<<explanation>>>: The sum() method of the IntStream class returns the sum of elements in this stream.
