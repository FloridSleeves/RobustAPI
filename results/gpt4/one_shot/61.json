This is done by creating a BufferedWriter object with the FileWriter object. The FileWriter object is created with the file path and a boolean value 'true' which means that the data will be written to the end of the file rather than the beginning. The newLine() method of BufferedWriter is then used to add a new line at the end of the file. The BufferedWriter is then closed to release the resources."
