    "prompt": "Please help me with my code questions using the given API. Only give me the code snippets. The explanation could be as precise as possible.\nQuestion: How to pause / sleep thread or process in Android?: I want to make a pause between two lines of code, Let me explain a bit:\n-> the user clicks a button (a card in fact) and I show it by changing the background of this button:\nthisbutton.setBackgroundResource(R.drawable.icon);\n-> after let's say 1 second, I need to go back to the previous state of the button by changing back its background:\nthisbutton.setBackgroundResource(R.drawable.defaultcard);\n-> I've tried to pause the thread between these two lines of code with:\ntry {\n    Thread.sleep(1000);\n} catch (InterruptedException e) {\n    // TODO Auto-generated catch block\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\nHowever, this does not work. Maybe it's the process and not the Thread that I need to pause?\nI've also tried (but it doesn't work):\nnew Reminder(5);\nWith this:\npublic class Reminder {\n        Timer timer;\n        public Reminder(int seconds) {\n            timer = new Timer();\n            timer.schedule(new RemindTask(), seconds*1000);\n        }\n\n        class RemindTask extends TimerTask {\n            public void run() {\n                System.out.format(\"Time's up!%n\");\n                timer.cancel(); //Terminate the timer thread\n            }\n        }  \n    }\nHow can I pause/sleep the thread or process?\nPlease using this api: Activity.findViewById.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Activity.findViewById\n<<<code>>>: private static class MyHandler extends Handler {}\nprivate final MyHandler mHandler = new MyHandler();\npublic static class MyRunnable implements Runnable {\n    private final WeakReference<Activity> mActivity;\n    public MyRunnable(Activity activity) {\n        mActivity = new WeakReference<>(activity);\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void run() throws Exception {\n        Activity activity = mActivity.get();\n        if (activity != null) {\n            Button btn = (Button) activity.findViewById(R.id.button);\n            btn.setBackgroundResource(R.drawable.defaultcard);\n        }\n    }\n}\nprivate MyRunnable mRunnable = new MyRunnable(this);\npublic void onClick(View view) {\n    my_button.setBackgroundResource(R.drawable.icon);\n    // Execute the Runnable in 2 seconds\n    mHandler.postDelayed(mRunnable, 2000);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: A more complex solution that avoids the memory leak subclasses the Handler and Runnable with static inner classes inside the activity since static inner classes do not hold an implicit reference to their outer class.\nQuestion: Android App Gets NullPointerException When Trying To Call A Method From Helper Class: :I have only been developing Android for two weeks now and have done lots of googling into this problem I have but can't seem to get anything to work.I have a Helper Class which has one method to set up DatePicker Limits etc.public class AlarmHelper extends Activity {    public void setupDatePicker(){        long maxTime = 52560000;        final Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance();        DatePicker dp = (DatePicker)findViewById(R.id.datePicker);        dp.setMinDate(cal.getTimeInMillis() - 1000);        dp.setMaxDate(cal.getTimeInMillis() + maxTime);    }}I then try to call the setupDatePicker() from the MainActivity in the onCreate() method like so.protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);    requestWindowFeature(Window.FEATURE_NO_TITLE);    getWindow().setFlags(WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_FULLSCREEN, WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_FULLSCREEN);    AlarmHelper helper = new AlarmHelper();    helper.setupDatePicker();    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);}When I run the app I get a NullPointerException. I believe it has something to do the the Context but I haven't got a clue how to implement it within my helper class.Any help would be greatly appreciated.\nPlease using this api: Activity.findViewById.\nAnswer:"
