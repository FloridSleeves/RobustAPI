This allows you to access any node in the linked list in O(1) time by accessing the corresponding index in the ArrayList. Note that this doesn't allow you to move nodes around in the linked list in O(1) time, it only allows you to access them in O(1) time. Moving nodes around in a linked list is always an O(n) operation because you have to update the next and previous pointers of the surrounding nodes."

I know that if i traverse the list to find a certain node it would take O(n) time so I want to map the nodes to an array list where I can access the nodes in O(1) time.I'm really unsure how I would do this mapping. I would like to see an example of how this can be done.Edit:I would like to be able to access any node in the linked list so I can move the nodes around in O(1) time.Example: Move node with ID 5 to end of list in O(1) time. Edit 2: I uploaded a picture example of what I'm trying to accomplish\nPlease using this api: List.get.\nAnswer:"
