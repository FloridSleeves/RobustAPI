The PrintWriter constructor you are using will overwrite the file, not append to it. You should create the FileWriter object with the append flag set to true, then pass that FileWriter object to the PrintWriter constructor. This way, the PrintWriter will append to the file instead of overwriting it."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Appending .txt file is erasing everything: :import java.io.FileWriter;import java.io.PrintWriter;public class DemoPrint {    public static void main (String args []) {        try{            PrintWriter coolFile = new PrintWriter(\"c:\\\\JavaIO\\\\cool.txt\");            FileWriter file = new FileWriter(\"c:\\\\JavaIO\\\\cool.txt\", true);            coolFile.println(\"Why isn't this adding another line?\");            coolFile.close();        }        catch (Exception e) {            System.out.println(\"Error\");        }}    }So I'm new to programming/java and I'm trying to open this file and append the data and add another line but for some reason the data is just being erased and overwritten with whatever I have in the coolFile.println(\"\").Can anyone help me out on this? I know its probably a easy fix... I'm learning.. Thank you!\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
