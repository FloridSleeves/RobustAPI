Including the SQL file with the APK is a common practice, especially when the data is static and doesn't change frequently. However, if the data changes frequently, you might want to consider fetching it from a server.\n\n2. You can put the SQL file in the assets folder of your project. Then, you can use the AssetManager to open the file and read its contents.\n\n3. To get the strings from the file and show them in the app, you can use SQLiteDatabase's rawQuery method to execute a SQL query and get a Cursor. You can then iterate over the Cursor to get the data and add it to an ArrayList. Finally, you can use this ArrayList to populate your ListView."
