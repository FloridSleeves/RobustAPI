However, you can use a Map to associate a String with an Integer. In this case, you can create a Map where the keys are Strings (\"music\", \"film\") and the values are Integers (0, 1). Then, you can use the get method of the Map to retrieve the Integer associated with a given String, and use that Integer as an index for the array."

Can you help me with this?\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Map.get\n<<<code>>>: import java.util.HashMap;import java.util.Map;Map<String, Integer> freq = new HashMap<String, Integer>();Integer count = freq.get(word);if (count == null) {freq.put(word, 1);}else {freq.put(word, count + 1);}\n<<<explanation>>>: If you look at the API for Map, get operations usually return null when the map does not contain the requested element. Note that this will make a solution.\nQuestion: Is it possible to link a string to an int?: :I want to be able to call on a certain int with the use of strings. So for instancefinal int music = 0;final int film = 1;int[][] matrix = new int[2][2];say I have a String m containing \"music\"and a String f containing \"film\"is there any way I could get this to work:matrix[m][f] = 1;\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:"
