It then calculates the modulus of the range to get a value within the desired range. If the calculated value is biased because the maximum representable value is not a multiple of the range, it discards the value and tries again. This ensures that the returned value is uniformly distributed within the range."

The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Bit-wise efficient uniform random number generation: :I recall reading about a method for efficiently using random bits in an article on a math-oriented website, but I can't seem to get the right keywords in Google to find it anymore, and it's not in my browser history.The gist of the problem that was being asked was to take a sequence of random numbers in the domain [domainStart, domainEnd) and efficiently use the bits of the random number sequence to project uniformly into the range [rangeStart, rangeEnd).  Both the domain and the range are integers (more correctly, longs and not Z). What's an algorithm to do this?Implementation-wise, I have a function with this signature:long doRead(InputStream in, long rangeStart, long rangeEnd);in is based on a CSPRNG (fed by a hardware RNG, conditioned through SecureRandom) that I am required to use; the return value must be between rangeStart and rangeEnd, but the obvious implementation of this is wasteful:long doRead(InputStream in, long rangeStart, long rangeEnd) {    long retVal = 0;    long range = rangeEnd - rangeStart;    // Fill until we get to range    for (int i = 0; (1 << (8 * i)) < range; i++) {        int in = 0;        do {            in = in.read();        // but be sure we don't exceed range        } while(retVal + (in << (8 * i)) >= range);        retVal += in << (8 * i);     }    return retVal + rangeStart;}I believe this is effectively the same idea as (rand() * (max - min)) + min, only we're discarding bits that push us over max. Rather than use a modulo operator which may incorrectly bias the results to the lower values, we discard those bits and try again.  Since hitting the CSPRNG may trigger re-seeding (which can block the InputStream), I'd like to avoid wasting random bits.  Henry points out that this code biases against 0 and 257; Banthar demonstrates it in an example.First edit: Henry reminded me that summation invokes the Central Limit Theorem.  I've fixed the code above to get around that problem.Second edit: Mechanical snail suggested that I look at the source for Random.nextInt().  After reading it for a while, I realized that this problem is similar to the base conversion problem.  See answer below.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
