To append to the file, you need to open the FileWriter in append mode by passing true as the second argument to the FileWriter constructor. Also, you should create the PrintWriter outside the loop and close it after the loop to ensure the file is properly written and resources are released."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: using for loop write lines one by one in file using java: :                                It's difficult to tell what is being asked here.
