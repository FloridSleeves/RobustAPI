The toString() method is used to convert the Passengers objects to a string representation. If the Passengers class does not have a toString() method that returns a string representation of the object, you will need to implement one. The \"\\n\" is used to insert a new line after each element. The writer is then closed to ensure that all changes are saved and resources are freed."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: How do I write String arrays to a text file in java using Printwriter?: :I need help writing some contents of array objects (following are two example of arrays I'm using) to a text file using Printwriter.
