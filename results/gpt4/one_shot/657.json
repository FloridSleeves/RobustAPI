For each word, it will check if it already exists in the HashMap. If it does not exist, it will add the word to the HashMap with a count of 1. If it does exist, it will increment the count by 1. The HashMap will then contain each unique word from the ArrayList as a key, with the value being the number of occurrences of that word."

Can you help me with this?\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Map.get\n<<<code>>>: import java.util.HashMap;import java.util.Map;Map<String, Integer> freq = new HashMap<String, Integer>();Integer count = freq.get(word);if (count == null) {freq.put(word, 1);}else {freq.put(word, count + 1);}\n<<<explanation>>>: If you look at the API for Map, get operations usually return null when the map does not contain the requested element. Note that this will make a solution.\nQuestion: Count occurrences of words in ArrayList: :This question already has answers here:                                                            How to count the number of occurrences of an element in a List                                (25 answers)                            Closed 9 years ago.I have an ArrayList of words with duplicate entries.I want to count and save occurrences for each word in a data structure.
