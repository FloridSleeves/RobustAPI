This method should correctly write the entire string, including spaces, to the file. The problem might be related to how you're reading the file or how the textarea data is being sent to the server. Make sure that the textarea data is being sent correctly and that you're reading the file correctly. If the problem persists, you might want to check the encoding of the file and the string."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Unusual outcome while writing to file: :I am having trouble while writing to file using the PrintWriter. Following is my code:String abc = request.getParameter(\"textAreaField\"); //String is \"a b c\" (with spaces)String fileA = dir + \"/A\";PrintWriter fileWriterA = new PrintWriter(new FileOutputStream(fileA,true));fileWriterA.println(abc);fileWriterA.close();The problem I am having here is while writing to the file \"A\" in the directory \"dir\" only \"a\" from String abc will be written and the rest after the space is not written. String abc here in the code is coming from a textarea in html and I have the above code in my servlet. I am not able to understand why it won't write the string with spaces to file. I think it should. I have also checked by printing the String abc and it does print the string \"a b c\" (with spaces). But it won't print that to file. Is there a problem with my code? Any help would be appreciated.Thanks in advance.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
