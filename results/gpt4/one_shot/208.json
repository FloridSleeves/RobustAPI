To ensure that a leading zero is added when necessary, you can use String.format() with the format specifier \"%02X\", which will output a two-digit uppercase hexadecimal number."

The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Read Java in as Hex: :I have tried to solve this but I keep coming up with stuff that is no help I'm sure this is easy (when you know how of course ;) ) What I would like to do is read in a file using a byte stream like below:while((read = in.read()) != -1){       //code removed to save space       Integer.toHexString(read);System.out.println(read);}When it prints out the Hex to the screen it will print out numbers fine e.g 3113120but when it comes to a hex code that should be 01 31 it will print 0 131. I want to read it in to a variable like you would see in a hex editor i.e 00 11 21 31 no single numbers as i need to scan the whole file and look for patterns which I know how to do I'm just stuck on this :/so in short i need a variabe to contain the two hex characters i.e int temp = 01 not int temp = 0 , I hope this all makes sense, I'm a little confused as it's 3am!If anyone knows how to do this I would be most greatful, p.s thanks for the help in advance this site has saved me loads of research and have learnt a lot!Many thanks.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
