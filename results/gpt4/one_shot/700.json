You need to initialize it before you can assign values to its elements. In the updated code, I have initialized the items array with a size of 2. Also, it's a good practice to close the PrintWriter after use to free up system resources."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: NullPointerException Error in program that writes to file: :I am trying to print strings into a file. What have I done wrong and it always gives me a NullPointException? I believe my exceptions catch something or an argument is needed and I dont enter it.
