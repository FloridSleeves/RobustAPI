By removing the reinitialization, the PrintWriter is correctly initialized and can be used in the printExp method. Also, the write method of PrintWriter is used instead of println to write the string to the file. The \"\\n\" is added to the end of the string to create a new line in the file."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Java create a class to print ArrayList to file: :Here is the code I have.This is my PrintToFile classimport java.util.*;import java.io.*;public class PrintToFile{        File f;        FileWriter fw;        PrintWriter pw;    public void PrintToFile()throws Exception{//remove void from constructor      File f = new File (\"Output.txt\");//dont reinitialize       FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(f, true);//dont reinitialize      PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(fw);//dont reinitialize    }    public void printExp(ArrayList<Expense> expList){        for(int i = 0; i < expList.size(); i++){         pw.println(\"---------------------------------------\");//exception here         pw.println(expList.get(i));      }        pw.close();    }}in my main class here is my call to print my ArrayList    PrintToFile printer = new PrintToFile();    printer.printExp(expList);   I have defined expList as an ArrayList of objects The exception I get is a Exception in thread \"main\" java.lang.NullPointerExceptionoccuring where marked.
