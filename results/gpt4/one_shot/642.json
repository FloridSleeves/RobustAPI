Can you help me with this?\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Map.get\n<<<code>>>: import java.util.HashMap;import java.util.Map;Map<String, Integer> freq = new HashMap<String, Integer>();Integer count = freq.get(word);if (count == null) {freq.put(word, 1);}else {freq.put(word, count + 1);}\n<<<explanation>>>: If you look at the API for Map, get operations usually return null when the map does not contain the requested element. Note that this will make a solution.\nQuestion: Finding the Key from Value in Map: :So I am having a bit of trouble understanding how to do this. I am building a word counter in Java using Map<String, Integer> where a word is the String and the amount of times that word was said in a .txt document is Integer. This is all working great...but I am trying to develop a part where it will display at the bottom what the top 5 results are ---> what the top 5 map.values() are.The problem I have run into is after I find the value, I can't get the String with it.Any suggestions would be very helpful to me.\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:"
