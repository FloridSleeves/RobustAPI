That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: calling system command from java program fails to execute: :Hi i tried to execute the following command from java code in linux,ls > out.txthere is my codetry             {                 Process p=Runtime.getRuntime().exec(\"ls > out.txt\");                 p.waitFor();                 BufferedReader reader=new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(p.getInputStream()));                 String line=reader.readLine();                 while(line!=null)                 {                 System.out.println(line);                 line=reader.readLine();                 }             }             catch(IOException e1) {}             catch(InterruptedException e2) {}             System.out.println(\"Done\"); I checked output file was not generated.
