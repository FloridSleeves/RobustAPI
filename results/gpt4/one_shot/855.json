It is possible to read arrays of data by using the read(byte[] b) method, which reads up to b.length bytes of data from this file into an array of bytes. This method blocks until at least one byte of input is available."

The last 6 bytes in my files contain crucial information when writing the files back. I need to write my original files, and then append the last 6 bytes elsewhere. Any guidance? Thanks\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: RandomAccessFile.read\n<<<code>>>: RandomAccessFile randomAccessFile = new RandomAccessFile(your_file, \"r\");randomAccessFile.seek(your_file.length() - n);try{randomAccessFile.read(byteArray, 0, n);} catch(IOException e) {e.printStackTrace();} \n<<<explanation>>>: You have to do it by using RandomAccessFile. Instances of this class support both reading and writing to a random access file. A random access file behaves like a large array of bytes stored in the file system. \nQuestion: Resource file format processing in Java: :I am trying to implement a processor for a specific resource archive file format in Java. The format has a Header comprised of a three-char description, a dummy byte, plus a byte indicating the number of files. Then each file has an entry consisting of a dummy byte, a twelve-char string describing the file name, a dummy byte, and an offset declared in a three-byte array. What would be the proper class for reading this kind of structure? I have tried RandomAccessFile but it does not allow to read arrays of data, e.g. I can only read three chars by calling readChar() three times, etc.Of course I can extend RandomAccessFile to do what I want but there's got to be a proper out-of-the-box class to do this kind of processing isn't it?This is my reader for the header in C#:protected override void ReadHeader(){    Header = new string(this.BinaryReader.ReadChars(3));    byte dummy = this.BinaryReader.ReadByte();    NFiles = this.BinaryReader.ReadByte();}\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:"
