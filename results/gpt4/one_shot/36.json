Instead, you should create the RelativeLayout inside the createDesign method and then return it to be used in the setContentView method. This way, the RelativeLayout is properly initialized before you try to add views to it."

I am confused how does it work? why doesn't it give error just like we get in java code? and most importantly, how does environment decide to which component it needs to invoke? I understand the process of id generation is automated, which gets added to R.java For instance, if we have same IDs, say \"image1\" in two XMLs, say \"layout1\" & \"layout2\". but in R.java it won't have 2 IDs. that means at a time it will reference only 1 component. In case we have to use 2 XMLs in an Activity, one as activity.setcontentview(layout1) and another as a PopupWindow.setContentView(layout2). What will happen in such case?\nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Activity.setContentView\n<<<code>>>: @Override\npublic void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n    Button myButton = (Button) findViewById(R.id.my_button);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You can findViewById of the current view hierarchy set to the activity. You cannot have same id for the view's in the same view tree. (must be unique).\nQuestion: create layout in code and get nullPointerException: :I create my layout in pure code.It worked and I decided to create another class to reuse my layout.I add a new class (Designer.java) to reuse my footer and header for other activities.I pass a context as parameter for other activities.rel2MainActivity has 3 childrenrelMainActivity is nullI don't understand what's wrong.
