That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: How to read/write String from/to .txt?: :I've got some text in a text file. I want to read it from file (first string - first line in file etc.), do something with it and then write to another text file.How to do it?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
