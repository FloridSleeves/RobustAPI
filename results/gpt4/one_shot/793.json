That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Check if fonts are embedded in an existing PDF?: :How can I check if the fonts are embedded in an existing PDF?That is, read an existing PDF and list out the results in a .txt fileI went through the following example:http://itextpdf.com/examples/iia.php?id=287The above example tries to create a new PDF, but I want to read a PDF file and check if the fonts are embedded or not.I am more of a PHP guy so having a hard time to tweak the code. Any help would be appreciated\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
