To fix this, you should create the PrintWriter outside of the loop and use the constructor that takes a second argument as true to enable the append mode. This way, each call to println will append the line to the end of the file instead of overwriting the whole file. Also, you should close the PrintWriter after all files have been processed, not after each line."

But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: How do you read/write and combine the output of multiple .text files and create a single .txt file?: :This question already has answers here:                                                            How to use PrintWriter and File classes in Java?
