If there isn't, it creates a new entry with key 1 and value \"foo.txt\". If there is, it increments the count and gets the value associated with the new count. If there is no value associated with the new count, it sets the value to \"foo.txt\". If there is, it appends \",hello.txt\" to the existing value. Finally, it puts the new count and the updated value back into the HashMap. This way, the HashMap always contains only one entry, but the key and value of the entry are updated each time."

Can you help me with this?\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Map.get\n<<<code>>>: import java.util.HashMap;import java.util.Map;Map<String, Integer> freq = new HashMap<String, Integer>();Integer count = freq.get(word);if (count == null) {freq.put(word, 1);}else {freq.put(word, count + 1);}\n<<<explanation>>>: If you look at the API for Map, get operations usually return null when the map does not contain the requested element. Note that this will make a solution.\nQuestion: How can a HashMap consist only of one entry/object?: :I would like to have a HashMap with only one key-value object.I have created the following HashMap:    HashMap <Integer,String>DocsCollection = new HashMap <Integer,String>();In the HashMap I would like to have only one entry/object.The key type is an Integer.The value type is a String.e.g.  = <1,\"foo.txt\"> Every time I find a specific word in a file I would like toIncrement the counter in keyAdd the new file in the valuee.g. Let's say that I'm searching for the word \"Hello\" in a DocsCollection,I have to store for every appearance of the word \"Hello\" the term frequency and concatenate the new file to the previous value.<3,\"foo.txt,hello.txt,test.txt\"> 3 means that I've found the word \"Hello\" in three files.and the Value consists of the files where the word was foundIf I use the method put, a new entry is created in the HashMap cause the key changes.It's not stable. It begins with \"1\" but when I find the word second time , the key increments and then the put method inserts a new entry with a new keyBut i would like to have only one entry and modify the key.Can this be done?How can i have only one object in a HashMap and modify the key every time?   DocsCollection.put(2,\"foo.txt,hello.txt\"); Thanks, in advance\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:"
