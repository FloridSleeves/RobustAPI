The method takes several parameters including the table name, the columns to return, the selection criteria, and the selection arguments. In this case, we are querying the \"SecondTable\" table, and we want to return the \"ID\", \"Word\", and \"Definition\" columns. The selection criteria is \"word_group_id=?\", which means we want to find the rows where the \"word_group_id\" column matches the given id. The selection arguments is an array that contains the actual values that will replace the \"?\" placeholders in the selection criteria. In this case, the selection arguments is {String.valueOf(id)}, which means the \"?\" placeholder will be replaced by the string representation of the given id. The query results are returned in a Cursor object. We then iterate through the Cursor, retrieve the data for each row, and add it to an ArrayList of WordContainer objects. Finally, we close the Cursor and the database, and return the ArrayList as an array of WordContainer objects."

Improve this question                    I have a database with two tables , First one contains 2 columns: group_ID , group_name . And the second one : ID, Word, Definition , word_group_id . This is the prototype of the function which I am going to write WordContainer [] findWordsByGroupId(int id);and this is the WordContainer class:public class WordContainer {      String word;      String definition;      int id  = -1;public WordContainer (int id , String word ,String definition){    this.id = id;    this.word = word;    this.definition = definition;}public void setWord (String word){    this.word = word;}public void setDefinition (String definition){    this.definition = definition;}public String getWord (){    return this.word;}public String getDefinition (){    return this.definition;}}So the question is , How to write a SQLite query which will find all the rows (or ids of those rows)which have the given group_id ; \nPlease using this api: SQLiteDatabase.query.\nAnswer:"
