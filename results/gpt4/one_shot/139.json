The MappedByteBuffer is trying to load the entire file into memory which is causing the IOException. Instead of using MappedByteBuffer, you can use a direct ByteBuffer. The direct ByteBuffer will not load the entire file into memory at once, instead it will load parts of the file as needed. This should solve your problem."

I wrote objects at various locations in the file. The objects were of variable sizes but all of the same class.Now I want to read from such a file. I dont want to have to specify the number of bytes to read. I want to be able to read the object directly using Object Input Stream. How to achieve this ? I have to use Random Access Files because I need to write to different positions in file. I am also recording in a separate data structure, the locations where objects have been written.\nPlease using this api: FileChannel.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileChannel.write\n<<<code>>>: while(rbb.hasRemaining()) {\n        try{\n            fileChannel.writeLong(recordBytes.length);\n            fileChannel.write(rbb);\n        } catch {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");}\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The simplest solution that comes to mind is to write out the length of the array before writing out the array itself. When reading the object, you first read the length. This'll tell you how many further bytes to read to get your object. Similarly to what you are already doing on the writing side, you could read the data into a byte[] and then use ByteArrayInputputStream and ObjectInputStream.\nQuestion: IOException when writing byte array: :I am getting IOException: Map Failed when trying to write a large byte array. I use the method below to write a byte array to a fileprivate static void write(byte[] data) throws Exception {        File file = new File(\"C:/temp/file.json\");        int length = data.length;        RandomAccessFile raf = new RandomAccessFile(file, \"rw\");        FileChannel fc = raf.getChannel();        MappedByteBuffer buffer = fc.map(FileChannel.MapMode.READ_WRITE, 0, length);        for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {            buffer.put(data[i]);        }}The byte array is about 270mb. Can anyone explain what I am doing wrong? Thanks.\nPlease using this api: FileChannel.write.\nAnswer:"
