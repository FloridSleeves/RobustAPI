Then, you append each line to a StringBuilder, adding a newline character at the end of each line. You then try to parse the entire content of the StringBuilder. If parsing is successful, you clear the StringBuilder and process the result. If parsing fails, you catch the exception and continue reading lines. This way, you can handle commands split into multiple lines and you don't reparse lines or run instructions twice."

The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Interactive Antlr: :I'm trying to write a simple interactive (using System.in as source) language using antlr, and I have a few problems with it. The examples I've found on the web are all using a per line cycle, e.g.:while(readline)  result = parse(line)  doStuff(result)But what if I'm writing something like pascal/smtp/etc, with a \"first line\" looks like X requirment? I know it can be checked in doStuff, but I think logically it is part of the syntax.Or what if a command is split into multiple lines? I can trywhile(readline)  lines.add(line)  try    result = parse(lines)    lines = []    doStuff(result)  catch    nopBut with this I'm also hiding real errors.Or I could reparse all lines everytime, but:it will be slow there are instructions I don't want to run twiceCan this be done with ANTLR, or if not, with something else?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
