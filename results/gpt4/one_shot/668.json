So, when you add \"\\n\" or \"\\r\\n\" at the end of the string, it results in two line separators. To fix this, you should use the PrintWriter#write method instead, which does not add a line separator."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: PrintWriter#println method not working as expected: :This code:PrintWriter output = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(outputFile, false));output.println(\"something\\n\");output.println(\"something else\\n\");Outputs:somethingsomething elseInstead of:somethingsomething elseI tried using \"\\r\\n\" instead of just \"\\n\" but it just doesn't work like how I want it to. How do I fix this?P.S. I'm using windows 7\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
