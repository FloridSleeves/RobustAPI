It often indicates that the class you're trying to test is doing too much and violates the Single Responsibility Principle. If you find yourself needing to partially mock a class, it might be a good idea to refactor your code and break down the class into smaller, more focused classes. This way, you can mock each class individually, making your tests more focused and easier to understand. However, in some cases, partial mocking can be useful, especially when dealing with legacy code or when you need to mock third-party libraries. In such cases, you might not have the option to refactor the code. As with many things in software development, whether partial mocking is good or bad depends on the context."

The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Easymock partially mocking (EasyMock ClassExtension), good or bad?: :I have written quite a few Mock objects using EasyMock. However, often i find writing partial mocks time consuming, and it does not feel 'right'.I'd say its a design fault as my class I try to mock has multiple concerns into one, therefore I should create seperate classes in order to seperate concerns.What do you think? Is partially mocking a good or bad thing? And, if good/bad, why? What would you suggest if you notice you cannot mock the object because you only want to mock a few methods?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
