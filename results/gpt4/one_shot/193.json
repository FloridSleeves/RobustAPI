In the provided code, an instance of `XMLInputFactory` is created and used to create an `XMLStreamReader` from the input stream. This reader, along with an `Attachments` instance created from the input stream and the content type \"multipart/related\", is passed to the `MTOMStAXSOAPModelBuilder` constructor. The SOAP envelope is then retrieved from the builder, and the SOAP body and first element of the body are retrieved from the envelope. This first element can then be handled as needed."

The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: How to parse XOP/MTOM SOAP response using java?: :I just want to know, is there any simple way for parsing  MTOM/XOP SOAP response. The problem is that I use plain HTTP to send soap message and javax.xml for parsing response. But some services responds me with mulipart/related and it    requires much more complex logic to parse it (performance matters). So I wonder may I somehow take advantage of apache cxf, apache axiom or any other library for parsing MTOM/XOP SOAP response?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
