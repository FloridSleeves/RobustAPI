Instead of storing all the data in an ArrayList, you should process each line of the file immediately as you read it. This way, you're only storing a small amount of data in memory at any given time. The StringTokenizer.nextToken method is used to split each line into the access type and memory address, which can then be processed immediately."

First I need to read 1 or more trace files. Each contains memory addresses for each access. Example: 0 F001CBAD2 EEECA89F0 EBC17910...Where the first integer indicates a read/write etc. then the hex memory address follows. With this data, I am supposed to run a simulation. So the idea I had was parse these data into an ArrayList<Trace> (for now I am using Java) with trace being a simple class containing the memory address and the access type (just a String and an integer). After which I plan to loop through these array lists to process them. The problem is even at parsing, it running out of heap space. Each trace file is ~200MB. I have up  to 8. Meaning minimum of ~1.6 GB of data I am trying to \"cache\"? What baffles me is I am only parsing 1 file and java is using 2GB according to my task manager ... What is a better way of doing this?
