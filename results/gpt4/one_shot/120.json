These classes are meant for sending and receiving objects, not raw bytes. Instead, you should use DataOutputStream and DataInputStream. \n\nIn the server-side code, we create a DataOutputStream from the socket's OutputStream and write the file's bytes to it. \n\nIn the client-side code, we create a DataInputStream from the socket's InputStream. We then read the bytes from the stream and write them to a file. We read the bytes in a loop until there are no more bytes to read (i.e., read() returns -1). This ensures that we read all the bytes, even if they don't all arrive at once. \n\nAlso, it's important to note that the buffer size of 4096 bytes is a common choice for network communication as it is a multiple of many common network packet sizes."
