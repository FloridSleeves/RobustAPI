That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: how to convert ANSI to utf8 in java?: :This question already has answers here:                                                            Converting a txt File from ANSI to UTF-8 programmatically                                (2 answers)                            Closed 9 years ago.I have a text file it is ANSI Encoding, i have to convert it into UTF8 encoding.
