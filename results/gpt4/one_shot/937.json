This could be a reasonable hash function for strings, but keep in mind that it will produce collisions for different strings that have the same first five characters. Also, it uses the UTF-8 encoding to convert characters to bytes, which means that it will not work correctly for strings that contain characters not representable in UTF-8."

Would that be a good idea, or is it a bad one?I am doing this in Java, but I wouldn't imagine that would make much of a difference.\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:"
