When you create a new FileOutputStream with the second parameter set to true, it will append to the file instead of overwriting it. You should create the FileOutputStream with only one parameter (the file), so it will overwrite the file. After removing the key from the properties, you should store the properties in the file again. This will overwrite the file with the new properties, effectively deleting the key and its value."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Delete an entry from property file: :How to delete key and value from property file? My property file has these contents:key1=value1 key2=value2I used the below code to delete the entry key2=value2. After that, now the file has these values:key1=value1 key2=value2Wed Mar 06 12:36:32 IST 2013 key1=value1java code to remove an entry:FileOutputStream out1 = new FileOutputStream(file, true);prop.remove(key);prop.store(out1,null);What is the mistake am doing. How to clear the whole content of the file before writing it.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
