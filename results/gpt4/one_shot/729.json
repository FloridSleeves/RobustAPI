In your case, you are using it to write the time difference between t2 and t1 to the file \"perfs.txt\". The \"\\n\" is used to add a new line after each write operation. The performance difference between the two servers could be due to a variety of factors, including but not limited to the number of cores, BIOS settings, and the specific configurations of the servers."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: java performance on two different servers: :not sure if this question should be here or in serverfault, but it's java-related so here it is:I have two servers, with very similar technology:server1 is Oracle/Sun x86 with dual x5670 CPU (2.93 GHz) (4 cores each), 12GB RAM. server2 is Dell R610 with dual x5680 CPU (3.3 GHz) (6 cores each), 16GB RAM.both are running Solaris x86, with exact same configuration.both have turbo-boost enabled, and no hyper-threading.server2 should therefore be SLIGHTLY faster than server1.I'm running the following short test program on the two platforms.import java.io.*;public class TestProgram {public static void main(String[] args) {    new TestProgram ();}public TestProgram () {    try {        PrintWriter writer  = new PrintWriter(new FileOutputStream(\"perfs.txt\", true), true);        for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {            long t1 = System.nanoTime();            System.out.println(\"0123456789qwertyuiop0123456789qwertyuiop0123456789qwertyuiop0123456789qwertyuiop\");            long t2 = System.nanoTime();            writer.println((t2-t1));            //try {            //  Thread.sleep(1);            //}            //catch(Exception e) {            //  System.out.println(\"thread sleep exception\");            //}        }    }    catch(Exception e) {        e.printStackTrace(System.out);    }}}I'm opening perfs.txt and averaging the results, I get:server1: average = 1664 , trim 10% = 1615server2: average = 1510 , trim 10% = 1429which is a somewhat expected result (server2 perfs > server1 perfs).now, I uncomment the \"Thread.sleep(1)\" part and test again, the results are now:server1: average = 27598 , trim 10% = 26583server2: average = 52320 , trim 10% = 39359this time server2 perfs < server1 perfsthat doesn't make any sense to me...obviously I'm looking at a way to improve server2 perfs in the second case. there must be some kind of configuration that is different, and I don't know which one.OS are identical, java version are identical.could it be linked to the number of cores ?maybe it's a BIOS setting ? although BIOS are different (AMI vs Dell), settings seem pretty similar.I'll update the Dell's BIOS soon and retest, but I would appreciate any insight...thanks\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
