We then pass this PrintWriter to the showDir method, which writes the file names and sizes to the PrintWriter instead of System.out. The PrintWriter writes the output to the file instead of the console. The writer is closed in a finally block to ensure it gets closed even if an exception occurs."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: how to output file lists to text file using java: :hello i am a newbie to java. i just started learning java last week.below is a code I am using to display all files and the corresponding file sizes of a folder and it's subfolder.However, instead of displaying the output in the Eclipse console, what I need to achieve is actually output the same data to a text file. I've been searching on the net on how to accomplish this over the last couple of days but I wasn't able to come to a solution.Can someone advise me on what code to use to accomplish my task?Thanks so much!public class ReadFile1 {public static void main(String[] a)throws IOException{showDir(1, new File(\"/Users/User/Documents/1 eclipse test/testfolder1\"));//File file = new File(\"/Users/User/Documents/1 eclipse test/testfolder1/puppy4.txt\");//long fileSize = file.length();}static void showDir(int indent, File file) throws IOException { for (int i = 0; i < indent; i++)      System.out.print('-');System.out.println(file.getName() + \" - \" + file.length() / 1024 + \" KB\");  if (file.isDirectory()) {  File[] files = file.listFiles();  for (int i = 0; i < files.length; i++)    showDir(indent + 4, files[i]);     }}}\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
