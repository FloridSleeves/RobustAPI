You need to call fi.getFieldName() and fi.getString() to get these values. Also, when comparing strings in Java, it's better to use the equals() method instead of the compareTo() method. The equals() method checks if two strings are exactly the same, while the compareTo() method checks the lexicographical difference between two strings. For reading the file, instead of reading one byte at a time, you can read a block of bytes and write them at once, which is more efficient."

The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Getting values of checkboxes along with uploading the file: :I was trying to upload an image in java using commonsIO  and Jar for file upload.But the problem am facing is that i am having two checkboxes on my form as follow : <div style=\"float:left\">  <input name=\"Mcheckbox\" type=\"checkbox\" value=\"Mobile\"/>  Mobile</div><div style=\"float:right\">  <input name=\"Echechkbox\" type=\"checkbox\" value=\"Email\"/>  Email</div>And then browse option : Upload Image : <INPUT TYPE=\"file\" NAME=\"file\" value=\"file\"></input>And in my servlet am doing something like this : ServletFileUpload upload = new ServletFileUpload(new DiskFileItemFactory());List<FileItem> files = new ServletFileUpload(new DiskFileItemFactory()).parseRequest(request);Iterator it = files.iterator();And then: while (it.hasNext()) {    FileItem fi = (FileItem) it.next();    if (fi.isFormField()) {        if (fieldname.compareTo(\"Mcheckbox\") == 0) {            System.out.println(\"checkbox value is \" + fieldvalue);            mymobilepass = fieldvalue;        } else if (fieldname.compareTo(\"Echeckbox\") == 0) {            System.out.println(\"checkbox value is \" + fieldvalue);            myemailpass = fieldvalue;        }    } else {        InputStream is = fi.getInputStream();        FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(path + \"\\\\\" + fi.getName());        int x = is.read();        while (x >= 0) {            fos.write((byte) x);            x = is.read();            //System.out.println(\"reading\");        }    }}But am getting null as the value of myemailpass or mymobilepass everytime.What can be the reason ? The if statement is never executed .Why ? Please help\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
