It works fine until screen orientation changes while ProgressDialog is up. ProgressDialog disappears and when after connection is established, app calls progressDialog.dismiss(); at this point app crashes because there is no ProgressDialog to dismiss.

However, since it takes around 3 seconds to complete, i don't just want the screen sitting and waiting for 3 seconds showing nothing. I would like it to display a ProgressDialog. I've tried everything in these threads and while most do 2 / 3, none seem to do all 3.Basically I have a button that when pressed, i want to parse the xml file and then use the data parsed from the file:void onButtonClicked() {    ProgressDialog pd = new ProgressDialog(this);    pd.setMessage(\"Parsing...\");    pd.show();    String[] ret;    return = parseXmlFile();    pd.dismiss();    if (ret[0] == \"steve\") {       sayHiToSteve();    }}  If I use an asyncTask, it will continue on with execution and check ret[0] before the task is completed and will just be null.if i do AsyncTask.get(), it pauses the execution but doesn't display the progress dialog, so that's no good either. I also looked at creating a seperate thread, but i had the same problem. I can't use a timer, because it is about 3 seconds (but can be up to 4 or 5 seconds if connection is slow), so i can't approximate. Any help is much appreciated.Thanks in advance.\nPlease using this api: ProgressDialog.dismiss.\nAnswer:"
