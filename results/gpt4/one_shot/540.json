Instead, you can use the doubleValue() method which is defined in the Number class and overridden in all its subclasses. This method returns the value of the number as a double, which can be used with the += operator. This solution will work for all subclasses of Number, including Integer, Double, and Long."

Try to just use the value of the foreach inside the loop.\nQuestion: Java 1.7: Sum of Iterable<T extends Number>: :I need to create a helper method which allows to create a sum of any Iterable<? extends Number>, because we have many vectors and require a fast method to determine the sum, so I created the following method: static Integer sum(Iterable<Integer> it) {    Integer result = 0;    for(T next : it) {        result += next;    }    return result; }This method only works for ints however, but we also have doubles and longs. Because you can't have two methods with the same signature (Our compiler thinks Integer sum(Iterable<Integer>) has the same signature as Double sum(Iterable<Double>).) I tried to write one method with generics.private static <T extends Number> T sum(Iterable<? extends T> it) {    T result;    for(T next : it) {        result += next;    }    return result;}However this method will not compile (reason: the operator += is undefined for Object, Object). What can I do here? I know in C++ you can overload operators, but not in Java. But every class which extends Number does overload the += operator. What can I do here?Thank you in advance.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
