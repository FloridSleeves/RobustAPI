This can cause the data to be written in an unexpected order. To solve this, you can use the println() method instead of append(), which automatically flushes the output buffer after writing the data. This ensures that the data is written to the file in the order that the methods are called."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: PrintWriter not appending content in the right order: :I have a list that contains objects (whose constructor contains another inner object). When I'm trying to print the list to a file, I go through each object and call the object's respective writer methods.public void writer(String file, boolean append) {    File path = new File(\"../Opdracht6_2/src/\" + file);    try {        PrintWriter write = new PrintWriter(new FileOutputStream(path,                append));        for (SuperObject o : this.list) {            if (o instanceof Object1) {                ((subObject1) w).writer1(file);            }            if (o instanceof Object2) {                ((subObject3) w).writer2(file);                            }if (o instanceof Object3) {                ((subObject3) w).writer3(file);                            }        }        write.close();    } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {        // TODO Auto-generated catch block        e.printStackTrace();    }}In the object's writer method I try to first print a line which says what type it is and then call the writer method for the innerobject. After that I want current object's arguments to be printed and than it goes back to the lists writer methodpublic void writer1(String file) {    File path = new File(\"../Opdracht6_2/src/\" + file);    try {        PrintWriter write = new PrintWriter(                new FileOutputStream(path, true));        //below is the string I want to print before the innerobject appends         //its own arguments to the file        write.append(\"String\\r\\n\");        this.innerobject.innerwriter();        write.append(this objects arg);        write.close();    } catch (IOException e) {        // TODO Auto-generated catch block        e.printStackTrace();    }}The innerobject's writerpublic void innerwriter(String file) {    File path = new File(\"../Opdracht6_2/src/\" + file);    try {        PrintWriter write = new PrintWriter(                new FileOutputStream(path, true));        write.append(this objects arg);        write.close();    } catch (IOException e) {        // TODO Auto-generated catch block        e.printStackTrace();    }}Now the thing that is actually happening is that the line that I'm trying to append first gets appended after the innerobject's arguments even though I have put it before the method that calls the innerobject's writer.It looks like this then in the file:inner objects argstringouter objects argCan someone explain why?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
