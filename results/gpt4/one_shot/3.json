    "prompt": "Please help me with my code questions using the given API. Only give me the code snippets. The explanation could be as precise as possible.\nQuestion: How to pause / sleep thread or process in Android?: I want to make a pause between two lines of code, Let me explain a bit:\n-> the user clicks a button (a card in fact) and I show it by changing the background of this button:\nthisbutton.setBackgroundResource(R.drawable.icon);\n-> after let's say 1 second, I need to go back to the previous state of the button by changing back its background:\nthisbutton.setBackgroundResource(R.drawable.defaultcard);\n-> I've tried to pause the thread between these two lines of code with:\ntry {\n    Thread.sleep(1000);\n} catch (InterruptedException e) {\n    // TODO Auto-generated catch block\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\nHowever, this does not work. Maybe it's the process and not the Thread that I need to pause?\nI've also tried (but it doesn't work):\nnew Reminder(5);\nWith this:\npublic class Reminder {\n        Timer timer;\n        public Reminder(int seconds) {\n            timer = new Timer();\n            timer.schedule(new RemindTask(), seconds*1000);\n        }\n\n        class RemindTask extends TimerTask {\n            public void run() {\n                System.out.format(\"Time's up!%n\");\n                timer.cancel(); //Terminate the timer thread\n            }\n        }  \n    }\nHow can I pause/sleep the thread or process?\nPlease using this api: Activity.findViewById.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Activity.findViewById\n<<<code>>>: private static class MyHandler extends Handler {}\nprivate final MyHandler mHandler = new MyHandler();\npublic static class MyRunnable implements Runnable {\n    private final WeakReference<Activity> mActivity;\n    public MyRunnable(Activity activity) {\n        mActivity = new WeakReference<>(activity);\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void run() throws Exception {\n        Activity activity = mActivity.get();\n        if (activity != null) {\n            Button btn = (Button) activity.findViewById(R.id.button);\n            btn.setBackgroundResource(R.drawable.defaultcard);\n        }\n    }\n}\nprivate MyRunnable mRunnable = new MyRunnable(this);\npublic void onClick(View view) {\n    my_button.setBackgroundResource(R.drawable.icon);\n    // Execute the Runnable in 2 seconds\n    mHandler.postDelayed(mRunnable, 2000);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: A more complex solution that avoids the memory leak subclasses the Handler and Runnable with static inner classes inside the activity since static inner classes do not hold an implicit reference to their outer class.\nQuestion: Change TextView value from Non-Activity class: :I'm trying to setText a new value to my TextView from a non activity class by inflating the layout where the textview is, but I'm still unsuccessful though I'm able to getText the current value of the TV. Here's the code:LayoutInflater mInflater = (LayoutInflater) mContext.getSystemService(mContext.LAYOUT_INFLATER_SERVICE);View view = mInflater.inflate(R.layout.target_details, null);TextView val = (TextView) view.findViewById(R.id.val);Not sure if I'm doing it properly.UPDATE:I used Kay's answer with added code below. It's now working.((Activity)mContext).runOnUiThread(new Runnable(){        @Override        public void run(){            //settext here        }    });\nPlease using this api: Activity.findViewById.\nAnswer:"
