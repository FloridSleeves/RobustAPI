This ensures that only one instance of SQLiteOpenHelper is created throughout the application. You can create a static method (like getInstance()) that returns the instance of SQLiteOpenHelper. This method creates a new instance if it's null, otherwise it returns the existing instance. \n\nAs for the close() method, it's generally a good practice to close the database when you're done with it to free up system resources. However, SQLiteOpenHelper manages the database lifecycle well, so you don't need to close it after every operation or even at the end of each activity. It's safe to leave the database connection open for the life of your application."

Two activities must save some informations so I use in both a MySQLiteHelper to access the database.I read here that building SQLiteOpenHelper as static data member could be a good practice so I did this. The static factory method ensures that there exists only one DatabaseHelper instance at any time.I create in each activity a SQLiteOpenHelper that uses the method getWritableDatabase() but I don't know where to use the close() method. Should I put this method after every modification or once at the end of the activity ? Thank you =)\nPlease using this api: SQLiteDatabase.query.\nAnswer:"
