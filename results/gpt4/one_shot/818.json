That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: How to write data to a String when in a for-loop: :So basically I have this database that is a for loop. It gives a different score every time, which I need to save to a String (or file, but I guess a string would be easier, because I need it to be empty at every new call for the database).I want to store all the scores by going through the loop, and then adding a , after each score (to keep them seperate) but my code isn't working because a part of the code is outside the for loop. How do I fix this? Or are there better/other methods to do what I want to create?DatabaseHandler db = new DatabaseHandler(camera.this);List<Database> contacts = db.getAllContacts();for (Database contact : contacts) {    String test = contact.getMP();    StringWriter stringWriter = new StringWriter();    PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(stringWriter);    printWriter.println(test);}  printWriter.flush();printWriter.close();return stringWriter.toString();\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
