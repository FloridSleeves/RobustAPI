You need to store the converted strings and then write them to the second file. In the provided code, a StringBuilder is used to store the converted strings. After reading all lines from the first file, the second file is opened for writing and the stored strings are written to it. The PrintWriter.write method is used to write the strings to the file."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Reading and Writing text file?: :I'm suppose to write a program in which we ask the user for 2 files the first file is for reading and the second for writingthe first one we are suppose to read the file and then copy the info switch it all to uppercase and save it to the second fileI cant get it to write on the second part any help?public class FileConverter {public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException{    Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);    System.out.println(\"Enter the filename for the first file\");    String filename = keyboard.nextLine();    File file = new File(filename);    Scanner inputFile = new Scanner (file);    while(inputFile.hasNext())    {        String fileinfo = inputFile.nextLine();        String uppercaseinfo1 = fileinfo.toUpperCase();    }    System.out.print(\"Enter the filename \"                + \"for the second file\");    filename = keyboard.nextLine();    PrintWriter outputFile = new PrintWriter(file);    while(inputFile.hasNext())        {            outputFile.println();        }}}\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
