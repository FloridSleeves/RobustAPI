However, you need to be careful about the order in which you use them. The ObjectOutputStream writes a header when it is created, so if you want to use a DataOutputStream first, you should create the ObjectOutputStream afterwards. Also, you should call flush() method after each write operation to make sure that the data is actually sent. In the provided code, we first send a text command \"INFO\" using DataOutputStream, then an object using ObjectOutputStream, then a text command \"DATA\" using DataOutputStream again, and finally an integer."

Is this possible and what is the best way to do it?I've tried just creating both types of objects, for example ObjectOutputStream and DataOutputStream, but that doesn't seem to work.The reason I want to switch between them is to, for example, send a text command \"INFO\" that signals I'm about to send an object with information or a command \"DATA\" signalling that I'm about to send data.  Any advice on the best way to do this is appreciated.\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:"
