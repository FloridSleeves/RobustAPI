This can cause issues with file writing where the data is not properly saved. Instead, you should use PrintWriter.write() and manually add a newline character (\"\\n\") to ensure that each log entry is on a new line. Also, don't forget to close the PrintWriter to ensure that all data is written and resources are freed."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Writing String to Text File: :I am saving a log to a .txt file on the sdcard but once there is two lines saved, it overwrites it and starts over?Here is my code: public static String getTimestamp() {    try {        SimpleDateFormat dateFormat = new SimpleDateFormat(\"MMMdd HH:mm:ss\", Locale.getDefault());        String currentTimeStamp = dateFormat.format(new Date()); // Find todays date        return currentTimeStamp;    } catch (Exception e) {        e.printStackTrace();        return null;    }}public static void writeToLog(Context context, String string) {    String text = getTimestamp() + \" \" + string;    // ONLY SAVES TWO LINES    try {        PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(logFile, true)));        out.println(text);        out.close();    } catch (IOException e) {        Log.d(Constants.APP_NAME, e.toString());    }}As soon as you mount /data in recovery, the log files in /sdcard & /data/media/0 show the full log history but not when the device is powered on\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
