The value byte is returned as an int in the range 0 to 255. If no byte is available because the end of the stream has been reached, the value -1 is returned. This method blocks until input data is available, the end of the stream is detected, or an exception is thrown. In your case, you are reading each byte individually and appending it to a string. You then check if the byte is a command ('s', 'r', or 'w'), and if it is, you handle the input and clear the string for the next command. This allows you to handle multiple commands in one line."

The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Reading and Handling Streams: :I want to read and handle a stream of String containing single OR multiple commands in one line.I am currently using InputStream in = socket.getInputStream(); for my inputstream.Also for handling the input a typical Thread:public void run() {    String input = \"\";    try {        int data = 0;        while (!isInterrupted()) {            while ((data = in.read()) != -1 && !isInterrupted()) {                input += Integer.toHexString(data);                handleInput(input);            }            try {                sleep(500);            } catch (InterruptedException e) {                break;            }        }        socket.close();        return;    } catch (IOException e) {        main.log(\"Connection lost...\");        main.log(e.toString());        main.stopBTCommunication();        main.startBTServer();    }}handleInput() is designed to handle any String given to it and response correctly. The problem with this implementation would be, that handleInput() is called with every byte read from in.read(). I know, that i could use BufferedReader.readLine(), but that would require every incomming command to have \"\\n\" appended to it, which is NOT the case and can't be changed. I know that         while (!isInterrupted()) {            while ((data = in.read()) != -1 && !isInterrupted()) { is kind of nuisance, but basically it want the Thread to read until nothing new is read, then handle that input and then read again...EDIT:So basically, what i need is a non-blocking read().EDIT2:How can incoming commands and commandchains look like:Select Command: \"s\"ReadLine Command: \"rlXX\" whereby X is a Hex DigitWriteLine Command: \"wlXXSSSSSSSS\" whereby X and S are Hex DigitsSo a commandschain may look like one of the following:\"s\"\"srlff\" = \"s\" + \"rlff\"\"rlffwlbb2e2e2e2erlbb\" = \"s\" + \"rlff\" + \"wlbb2e2e2e2e\" + \"rlbb\"\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
