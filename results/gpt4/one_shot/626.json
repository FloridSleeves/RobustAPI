The static variables name and code in the Cow class are declared as private, which means they cannot be accessed directly from a subclass (Milk). To fix this, you should change the access modifier of these variables to protected, which allows them to be accessed within the same package and subclasses. Also, static variables are class level variables, they are not associated with individual instances but with the class itself. Therefore, all instances of the class (and its subclasses) share the same static variable. If you change the value of a static variable, it changes for all instances of the class."

Can you help me with this?\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Map.get\n<<<code>>>: import java.util.HashMap;import java.util.Map;Map<String, Integer> freq = new HashMap<String, Integer>();Integer count = freq.get(word);if (count == null) {freq.put(word, 1);}else {freq.put(word, count + 1);}\n<<<explanation>>>: If you look at the API for Map, get operations usually return null when the map does not contain the requested element. Note that this will make a solution.\nQuestion: Java static attributes in an abstract class: :I want to set the name and the code static attributes in the milk class.Why doesn't this work?I can't even override the setters/getters of the name and the code.    public abstract class Cow {        private static String name;        private static String code;    ...     public static String getName() {            return name;        }        public static void setName(String name) {            Cow.name = name;        }        public static String getCode() {            return code;        }        public static void setCode(String code) {            Cow.code = code;        }    ...    }public class Milk extends Cow{...    static {            Milk.setName(\"asdmilk\");        Milk.setCode(\"KDDFA\");        }..}\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:"
