The second parameter in the FileOutputStream constructor is set to true, which means that the file is opened in append mode. This means that each time you write to the file, the new data will be added to the end of the file, rather than overwriting the existing data. The write method of the PrintWriter is then used to write a custom log message to the file. After writing the message, the writer is closed to free up system resources."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: How to specify your own logging messages: :At work, I was asked to find a way of creating a customised logging level system that would output to a .log file. I found a way that works really well, so I thought I'd share. Please see my answer\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
