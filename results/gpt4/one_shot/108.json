When a client connects to the server, the server should store the client's socket in a data structure. When the server wants to send a message to a specific client, it can look up the client's socket in the data structure and write the message to the socket's output stream. The above code snippet is a method that takes a client's socket and a message as parameters, and sends the message to the client."
