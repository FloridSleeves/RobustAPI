It then creates a new RandomAccessFile, and seeks to the end of the file. A CipherOutputStream is created from the RandomAccessFile, and data is written to it. The CipherOutputStream is then closed. This allows you to append to an AES encrypted file without having to decrypt it every time you want to append some messages. However, please note that the key and IV should be kept secret and secure, and should not be hard-coded as in this example."

I wrote an alternative implementation for writeLong using a byte[]. Something like this:\n\nRandomAccessFile randomAccessFile = new RandomAccessFile(\"out.dat\", \"rwd\");\n...\nbyte[] aux = new byte[8];\naux[0] = (byte) ((l >>> 56) & 0xFF);\naux[1] = (byte) ((l >>> 48) & 0xFF);\naux[2] = (byte) ((l >>> 40) & 0xFF);\naux[3] = (byte) ((l >>> 32) & 0xFF);\naux[4] = (byte) ((l >>> 24) & 0xFF);\naux[5] = (byte) ((l >>> 16) & 0xFF);\naux[6] = (byte) ((l >>> 8) & 0xFF);\naux[7] = (byte) ((l >>> 0) & 0xFF);\nrandomAccessFile.write(aux);\n\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: RandomAccessFile.write\n<<<code>>>: {\n    RandomAccessFile raf = new RandomAccessFile(\"test.dat\", \"rwd\");\n    int longCount = 10000;\n    long start = System.nanoTime();\n    for (long l = 0; l < longCount; l++)\n        raf.writeLong(l);\n    long time = System.nanoTime() - start;\n    System.out.printf(\"writeLong() took %,d us on average%n\", time / longCount / 1000);\n    raf.close();\n}\n{\n    RandomAccessFile raf = new RandomAccessFile(\"test2.dat\", \"rwd\");\n    int longCount = 10000;\n    long start = System.nanoTime();\n    byte[] aux = new byte[8];\n    try {\n        for (long l = 0; l < longCount; l++) {\n            aux[0] = (byte) (l >>> 56);\n            aux[1] = (byte) (l >>> 48);\n            aux[2] = (byte) (l >>> 40);\n            aux[3] = (byte) (l >>> 32);\n            aux[4] = (byte) (l >>> 24);\n            aux[5] = (byte) (l >>> 16);\n            aux[6] = (byte) (l >>> 8);\n            aux[7] = (byte) l;\n            \n            raf.write(aux);\n            \n        }\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    }\n    long time = System.nanoTime() - start;\n    System.out.printf(\"write byte[8] took %,d us on average%n\", time / longCount / 1000);\n    raf.close();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: It appears that the RandomAccessFile.writeLong() doesn't minimise the number of calls to the OS. The cost increases dramatically by using \"rwd\" instead of \"rw\" which should be enough to indicate its not the calls themselves which cost the time. (its the fact the OS is try to commit every write to disk and the disk only spins so fast)\nQuestion: How to append to AES encrypted file: :I'm writing some kind of logger that produces encrypted log-file. Unfortunately, cryptography is not my strong side. Now I can write to file several messages and then close file. Then i can open it, append some messages, close again and after decryption I see padding bytes in the middle of file. Is there any way to work with encrypted file without having to decrypt it every time I want to append some messages?EDIT: little more details. Current implementation utlizes CipherOutputStream. As i understand there's no way to seek using it.Can i use 'NoPadding' option if i will control that output data size is divisible by block size?\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.write.\nAnswer:"
