Then it creates a new PrintWriter object, specifying the file name (which is the user name plus \".txt\") and the character encoding (\"UTF-8\"). The PrintWriter.write method is then used to write the user name to the file. The writer is then closed to ensure that the data is actually written to the file and not just held in memory. If an IOException occurs during this process, it is caught and an error message is printed."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: How to create a txt file in Java?: :I'm just want a program to register a user and then create a txt file to store there the information. I know it has to be with createNewFile method but I do not know how to use it. I'd try this in my code:import java.util.*;public class File{public static void main(String args[]){    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);byte option=0;    do{        System.out.println(\"\\nMENU:\\n\");        System.out.println(\"0.-EXIT\");        System.out.println(\"1.-REGISTER USER\");        System.out.println(\"\\nPLEASE ENTER YOUR CHOICE:\");        option = sc.nextByte();    }while(option!=0);}//main}//File\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
