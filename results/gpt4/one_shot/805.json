If the file does not exist, we create it using the createNewFile() method. Then, we create a PrintWriter object to write to the file. We iterate over the array of strings, writing each string to the file followed by a newline character. After writing all strings, we close the PrintWriter. To read from the file, we create a BufferedReader object and read each line of the file. We can then insert each line into the array. After reading all lines, we close the BufferedReader."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Working with files in java: :I have an array of strings.I want to save those strings in a file.The problem is, I need to make a new file called db.txt (only if it doesn't exist),then somehow write strings to it.And then later I want to be able to read strings from that file and insert them to the array.Inserting and using array is not the question, but the question is how do I mess with the files? How do I create a new text file (if not existing already), how do I write to it and how do I read from it? Tried to learn it by myself but I've seen so many ways on the Internet and got confused.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
