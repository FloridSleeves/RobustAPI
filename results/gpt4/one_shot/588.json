However, to answer your question, Java does not provide a SortedList because the List interface is meant to represent an ordered collection (i.e., a sequence), and the order is not necessarily a sort order. The order of elements in a List is determined by the order in which elements are inserted into the list. If you need a sorted list, you can use the Collections.sort() method to sort a list, or use a SortedSet if you don't need to have duplicate elements."

Both belong to the Java Collections framework and provide a sorted way to access the elements. However, in my understanding there is no SortedList in Java. You can use java.util.Collections.sort() to sort a list.Any idea why it is designed like that?\nPlease using this api: List.get.\nAnswer:"
