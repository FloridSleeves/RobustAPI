In the provided code, we explicitly create an Iterator for the Queue collection. The hasNext() method of Iterator checks if there are more elements in the collection. If there are, the next() method retrieves the next Transaction object from the collection. This object is then printed out. This process repeats until there are no more elements in the collection."

Try to just use the value of the foreach inside the loop.\nQuestion: Iteration through data structures(queue, stacks, bags): :Queue<Transaction> collection = new Queue<Transaction>andfor(Transaction t: collection){ StdOut.println(t); }From my understanding of objects, it looks like we just created an object, the queue, of datatype transaction(type parameter) and collection is the reference to that object. Correct? Then the second bit of code is what confuses me. We are looping to print whats in the queue but i'm not sure i understand how this works. collection points to the Queue of type Transaction. It looks like we are creating a reference t to the object Transaction and doing something with it to the reference collection. Pretty confused.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
