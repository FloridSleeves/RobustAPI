Then we get the reference to our TableLayout from the layout file. We then create a loop for the height of the matrix, and inside that loop, we create a new TableRow for each row of the matrix. Inside each TableRow, we create another loop for the width of the matrix, and inside that loop, we create a new EditText for each cell of the matrix. We then add each EditText to the TableRow, and finally add each TableRow to the TableLayout. This will create a matrix of EditTexts where the user can enter values."

I am confused how does it work? why doesn't it give error just like we get in java code? and most importantly, how does environment decide to which component it needs to invoke? I understand the process of id generation is automated, which gets added to R.java For instance, if we have same IDs, say \"image1\" in two XMLs, say \"layout1\" & \"layout2\". but in R.java it won't have 2 IDs. that means at a time it will reference only 1 component. In case we have to use 2 XMLs in an Activity, one as activity.setcontentview(layout1) and another as a PopupWindow.setContentView(layout2). What will happen in such case?\nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Activity.setContentView\n<<<code>>>: @Override\npublic void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n    Button myButton = (Button) findViewById(R.id.my_button);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You can findViewById of the current view hierarchy set to the activity. You cannot have same id for the view's in the same view tree. (must be unique).\nQuestion: How would you draw a matrix in Android Development?: :The size of the matrix would be input by the user with variables h, w.Given this how would I create a matrix of that size on the screen allowing the user to enter in values inside the matrix.\nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer:"
