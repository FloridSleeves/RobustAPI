In your case, you are using it to break each line of your file into tokens. The delimiter you are using is a space (\" \"), which means that the string will be split every time a space is encountered. The nextToken() method is used to get the next token from the StringTokenizer. In your while loop, you are reading each line of the file, breaking it into tokens, and then storing the tokens in your arrays. The first token (the student ID) is converted to an integer and stored in the studentID array, and the second token (the student's answers) is stored in the studentAnswers array. This process is repeated for each line in the file."

You may have recently seen a post by me looking for help, but I did it wrong before, so I am going to start fresh and begin at the basics.I am trying to read a text file that looks like this:FTFFFTTFFTFT  3054 FTFFFTTFFTFT  4674 FTFTFFTTTFTF  ... etcWhat I need to do is put the first line into a String as the answer key.Next, I need to create an array with the student ID (the first numbers).Then, I need to create an array that is parallel to the student ID that contains the student's answers.Below is my code, and I can't quite figure out how to get it to work like this, and I was wondering if someone could help me out with it.public static String[] getData() throws IOException {      int[] studentID = new int[50];      String[] studentAnswers = new String[50];      int total = 0;      String line = reader.readLine();      strTkn = new StringTokenizer(line);      String answerKey = strTkn.nextToken();      while(line != null) {        studentID[total] = Integer.parseInt(strTkn.nextToken());        studentAnswers[total] = strTkn.nextToken();        total++;      }    return studentAnswers;    }So at the end of the day, the array structure should look like:studentID[0] = 3054studentID[1] = 4674... etcstudentAnswers[0] = FTFFFTTFFTFTstudentAnswers[1] = FTFTFFTTTFTFThanks :)\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
