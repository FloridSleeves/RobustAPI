It then reads that many bytes from the InputStream. This way, it knows exactly how many bytes to read and doesn't have to rely on an end-of-line byte. Note that this assumes that the length is stored as an integer in the first 4 bytes of the message. If it's stored differently, you'll need to adjust the code accordingly."

The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Using JMeter TCP Sampler is it possible to determine message length using first bytes of the response: :I need some help on identifying the length of the response using the the first byte(s) of the message. Currently using JMeter to send some TCP request but unfortunately it is not able to determine the end of the message, so it hangs. The communication protocol is Google Protobufs (protocol buffers) and does not have an indicator to determine the end of message. Below is what Jmeter has.  I would appreciate if someone can tell me how I can build on top of this so I can measure the length of the message using the first bytes of the response.
