We are passing a new Comparator as an argument to the sort() method. Inside the compare() method, we are getting the value of the key \"number\" from the HashMaps and comparing them. The compareTo() method is used to compare the Strings. If the String in o1 is lexicographically less than the String in o2, then it returns a negative value. If the String in o1 is lexicographically greater than the String in o2, then it returns a positive value. If both the strings are equal, then it returns 0. Based on this return value, the sort() method sorts the ArrayList."

Can you help me with this?\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Map.get\n<<<code>>>: import java.util.HashMap;import java.util.Map;Map<String, Integer> freq = new HashMap<String, Integer>();Integer count = freq.get(word);if (count == null) {freq.put(word, 1);}else {freq.put(word, count + 1);}\n<<<explanation>>>: If you look at the API for Map, get operations usually return null when the map does not contain the requested element. Note that this will make a solution.\nQuestion: different ways of sorting ArrayList of of HashMap<String, String>: :There are many question related to this which suggests to use Comparator to compare and sort data, and I am already trying it and struggling to make it work so please don't report it as duplicate.I have an arraylist of HashMap<String, String> ArrayList<HashMap<String, String>>and having data in this list in this form,title , link and number are keys.{ {title=\"\",link=\"\",number=}, {title=\"\",link=\"\",number=}, {title=\"\",link=\"\",number=} }Example,{ {title,link,number = 8}, {title,link,number = 1}, {title,link,number = 3} }should be changed to,{ {title,link,number = 1}, {title,link,number = 3}, {title,link,number = 8} }and I wanted to sort it based on the number, I have tried this,I create a new class (as suggested in many post to create new class to compare data) which implements Comparator.public class SortData implements Comparator<ArrayList<HashMap<String, String>>> the method which is automatically implemented is ,@Override    public int compare(ArrayList<HashMap<String, String>> lhs,            ArrayList<HashMap<String, String>> rhs) {        return 0;    }Now this method suggest to use two arraylist of Hashmap to compare, but since I have only one arraylist which needs to be sorted so what should i use for the second arraylist ?my Arraylist name is SecondArray, and I want to compare each value of it with the next value, @Override        public int compare(ArrayList<HashMap<String, String>> lhs,                ArrayList<HashMap<String, String>> rhs) {                lhs = SecondArray;                rhs = // How to compare to the next value of the same Array ?             return 0;        }How should I compare the same arraylist with the next value ?Update:each Array list element has three key/value pairs, one of them is a number , I want to sort the arraylist based on that number , which means, key/value pairs which has the lowest number should be first in the array list.\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:"
