The get_A_byName method uses the Map.get API to retrieve the instance of class A by its name. If the name does not exist in the map, the method will return null."

Can you help me with this?\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Map.get\n<<<code>>>: import java.util.HashMap;import java.util.Map;Map<String, Integer> freq = new HashMap<String, Integer>();Integer count = freq.get(word);if (count == null) {freq.put(word, 1);}else {freq.put(word, count + 1);}\n<<<explanation>>>: If you look at the API for Map, get operations usually return null when the map does not contain the requested element. Note that this will make a solution.\nQuestion: Get instance variable by its name: :I have two classes, A and B. B contains the instances of A. I want to return instance of A from B by its name:class A{    public String name;    public A (String name)    {        this.name = name;    }}class B{    public A a1;    public A a2;    public A a3;    public B ()    {        this.a1 = new A (\"a1\");        this.a2 = new A (\"a2\");        this.a3 = new A (\"a3\");    }    public A get_A_byName (String name)    {        // Is it possible to write something like this?
