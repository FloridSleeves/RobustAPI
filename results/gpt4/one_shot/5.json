Maybe it's the process and not the Thread that I need to pause?\nI've also tried (but it doesn't work):\nnew Reminder(5);\nWith this:\npublic class Reminder {\n        Timer timer;\n        public Reminder(int seconds) {\n            timer = new Timer();\n            timer.schedule(new RemindTask(), seconds*1000);\n        }\n\n        class RemindTask extends TimerTask {\n            public void run() {\n                System.out.format(\"Time's up!%n\");\n                timer.cancel(); //Terminate the timer thread\n            }\n        }  \n    }\nHow can I pause/sleep the thread or process?\nPlease using this api: Activity.findViewById.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Activity.findViewById\n<<<code>>>: private static class MyHandler extends Handler {}\nprivate final MyHandler mHandler = new MyHandler();\npublic static class MyRunnable implements Runnable {\n    private final WeakReference<Activity> mActivity;\n    public MyRunnable(Activity activity) {\n        mActivity = new WeakReference<>(activity);\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void run() throws Exception {\n        Activity activity = mActivity.get();\n        if (activity != null) {\n            Button btn = (Button) activity.findViewById(R.id.button);\n            btn.setBackgroundResource(R.drawable.defaultcard);\n        }\n    }\n}\nprivate MyRunnable mRunnable = new MyRunnable(this);\npublic void onClick(View view) {\n    my_button.setBackgroundResource(R.drawable.icon);\n    // Execute the Runnable in 2 seconds\n    mHandler.postDelayed(mRunnable, 2000);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: A more complex solution that avoids the memory leak subclasses the Handler and Runnable with static inner classes inside the activity since static inner classes do not hold an implicit reference to their outer class.\nQuestion: Java how to use activity methods in another class: :For example I have an activity class. In this class I have some variables and I'd like to use them in another class. This is the code:public class SearchView {    private MenuActivity menuActivity;    public SearchView() {        menuActivity = new MenuActivity();        menuActivity.searchButton = (ImageView) menuActivity.findViewById(R.id.searchButton);    }}Last line gives me a NullPointerException. I know I need to initialize it but how can I initialize an activity?\nPlease using this api: Activity.findViewById.\nAnswer:"
