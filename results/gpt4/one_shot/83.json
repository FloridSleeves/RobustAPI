In this case, you can use it to merge your three byte arrays. After writing the data to the ByteArrayOutputStream object, you can use the toByteArray() method to retrieve the combined data. \n\nTo split the combined byte array, you will need to know the lengths of the original byte arrays. You can then use the System.arraycopy method to copy the relevant parts of the combined array into new arrays. \n\nPlease note that this method does not add any separators between the arrays, so you need to know exactly where one array ends and the next one starts. If you don't have this information, you will need to add some kind of separator between the arrays when you combine them."

Any help will be appreciated.NOTE:-All the three byteArrays value will be different in different scenarios.. I am looking the most efficient way to store the resulting byteArrays in such a way such that it doesn't take that much space on the disk. I dont want to serialize it again since avroBinaryValue that I am getting is coming from Avro Data Serialization.. So I want to convert the other two things as well in ByteArray so that I can merge all three together into a single ByteArray.\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:"
