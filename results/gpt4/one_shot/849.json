The last 6 bytes in my files contain crucial information when writing the files back. I need to write my original files, and then append the last 6 bytes elsewhere. Any guidance? Thanks\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: RandomAccessFile.read\n<<<code>>>: RandomAccessFile randomAccessFile = new RandomAccessFile(your_file, \"r\");randomAccessFile.seek(your_file.length() - n);try{randomAccessFile.read(byteArray, 0, n);} catch(IOException e) {e.printStackTrace();} \n<<<explanation>>>: You have to do it by using RandomAccessFile. Instances of this class support both reading and writing to a random access file. A random access file behaves like a large array of bytes stored in the file system. \nQuestion: Gets the uncompressed size of this GZIPInputStream?: :I have a GZIPInputStream that I constructed from another ByteArrayInputStream. I want to know the original (uncompressed) length for the gzip data. Although I can read to the end of the GZIPInputStream, then count the number, it will cost much time and waste CPU. I would like to know the size before read it.Is there a similiar method like ZipEntry.getSize() for GZIPInputStream:public long getSize ()Since: API Level 1  Gets the uncompressed size of this ZipEntry.\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:"
