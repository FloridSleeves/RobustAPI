You first create a RandomAccessFile object and open the file in read mode. Then, you use the seek method to move the file pointer to the start of the segment you want to read. You then read the bytes into a byte array. The number of bytes you read is the difference between the end byte and the start byte. Finally, you close the RandomAccessFile object."

    "prompt": "Please answer my code questions using the given API following this format: <<<api>>>: $API\n<<<code>>>: $CODE\n<<<explanation>>>: $EXPLANATION.\nQuestion: How do I read the last \"n\" bytes of a file in Java: How do I read the last n number of bytes from a file, without using RandomAccessFile. The last 6 bytes in my files contain crucial information when writing the files back. I need to write my original files, and then append the last 6 bytes elsewhere. Any guidance? Thanks\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: RandomAccessFile.read\n<<<code>>>: RandomAccessFile randomAccessFile = new RandomAccessFile(your_file, \"r\");randomAccessFile.seek(your_file.length() - n);try{randomAccessFile.read(byteArray, 0, n);} catch(IOException e) {e.printStackTrace();} \n<<<explanation>>>: You have to do it by using RandomAccessFile. Instances of this class support both reading and writing to a random access file. A random access file behaves like a large array of bytes stored in the file system. \nQuestion: Read a segment of a file in Java / Android: :I'm sure this might be a simple question, but unfortunately this is my first time using Java and working the Android SDK.I am uploading files on Android using the Apache HTTP libraries, in particular using the MultipartEntity.I'm uploading to a service that allows me to send them chunks of the file, and once complete, they'll reassemble the chunks.  I'd like to take advantage of this feature.Here's the scenario.File FOO.BAR is 20 MB.  I'd split it into some arbitrary chunk size, let's say 1 MB, which means 20 chunks.   Chunks #3 and #14 fail (maybe the cellular/WiFi connection was bad).  I can now re-upload just these two chunks and everything will be good.What I'd like to know is how can I read only part of a file (like the data between 3MB and 4MB)?  The file piece should be an InputStream or File object.Thanks,Makoto\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:"
