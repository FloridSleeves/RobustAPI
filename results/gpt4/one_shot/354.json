In your case, since you know there is only one element in the collection, you can directly use this method to get that element. You should also check if the collection is not null and not empty before trying to retrieve an element to avoid NullPointerException or NoSuchElementException."

Because collections do not guarantee consistent ordering, there is no first() or get(int index) methods, so I need to use rather ugly things, such as:public Integer sillyExample(Collection<Integer> collection){    if(collection.size()==1){        return collection.iterator().next();    }    return someCodeToDecideBetweenElements(collection);}So, how do you get the only element out? I can't believe there isn't a better way...Please note, I understand there's no concept of \"first\", I'm just trying to avoid building an iterator when I know there is only one element in it.EDIT: Peter Wooster found a very similar question here. I'm leaving this open because I'm not trying to get the \"first\" element, which would imply a consistent ordering, but the \"one and only\" element after checking that it indeed is the only element.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
