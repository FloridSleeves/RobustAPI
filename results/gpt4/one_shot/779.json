That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: FileOutputStream set encoding to utf-8: :a want to set a file to utf-8the FileOutputStream takes just two parametermy code is  PrintWriter kitaba1 = null;    try {       kitaba1 = new PrintWriter(new FileOutputStream(new File(ismmilaf), true ));    } catch (FileNotFoundException ex) {        ex.printStackTrace();    }    //kitaba1.println(moarif1);    kitaba1.close();\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
