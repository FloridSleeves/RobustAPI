The get method of the Map API returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or null if this map contains no mapping for the key. In your case, it seems that the value associated with 'somekey' is not always a String, Integer, or Double. To avoid the ClassCastException, you should first check the type of the object returned by the get method using the instanceof operator, and then perform the appropriate cast."

Can you help me with this?\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Map.get\n<<<code>>>: import java.util.HashMap;import java.util.Map;Map<String, Integer> freq = new HashMap<String, Integer>();Integer count = freq.get(word);if (count == null) {freq.put(word, 1);}else {freq.put(word, count + 1);}\n<<<explanation>>>: If you look at the API for Map, get operations usually return null when the map does not contain the requested element. Note that this will make a solution.\nQuestion: Bug casting String, Integer, Double using HashMap: :I have some strange bug on Android 2.3 and lower.I have following code:HashMap<Somekey, Object> data = new HashMap<Somekey, Object>();data.put(somekey, \"asdfdsafdsf\");String value = (String) data.get(somekey);on the last line I have ClassCastException: get(somekey) returns Boolean value instead of String. This error appears not only with String type, with Integer and Double too.I don't understand why, because this code correctly works on android 4.0.3 and higher.\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:"
