Instead, you should directly cast the object returned by get() to Double. This is because the get() method returns an Object, and you stored a Double in the map, so you can safely cast it to Double."

Can you help me with this?\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Map.get\n<<<code>>>: import java.util.HashMap;import java.util.Map;Map<String, Integer> freq = new HashMap<String, Integer>();Integer count = freq.get(word);if (count == null) {freq.put(word, 1);}else {freq.put(word, count + 1);}\n<<<explanation>>>: If you look at the API for Map, get operations usually return null when the map does not contain the requested element. Note that this will make a solution.\nQuestion: Java : java.lang.Double cannot be cast to java.lang.String: :I am storing a double value inside the a HashMap as shown HashMap listMap = new HashMap();double mvalue =0.0;listMap.put(\"mvalue\",mvalue );Now when i tried to retrieve that value , as shown mvalue = Double.parseDouble((String) listMap.get(\"mvalue\"));i am getting an error as java.lang.Double cannot be cast to java.lang.String I am confused here , This is my actual HashMap and i am setting the values in it as shown HashMap listMap = new HashMap();double mvalue =0.0 ;List<Bag> bagList = null; listMap.put(\"bagItems\",bagList);listMap.put(\"mvalue\", mvalue);Could anybody please tell me , how the structure of the HashMap should be ?\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:"
