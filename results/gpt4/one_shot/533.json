However, you can use the synchronized keyword to ensure that only one thread can access the collection at a time. This code block will lock the collection, iterate over it, and then release the lock when it's done. The lock is released when the synchronized block is exited, not when the wrapper is garbage collected."

Try to just use the value of the foreach inside the loop.\nQuestion: Java synchronised iterators?: :I'm looking for a way to call a method that returns from the the called object, an iterable collection, the source (the collection instance in the called object) of which will prevent simultaneous access by other threads.I would imagine this iterable collection would be wrapped in a class in which was provided a synchronisation mechnanism such that when the caller was finished with the collection it might call a method called finished() that would release the lock on the underlying collection object. Although the API's have the methods that return synchronised versions of common collections, there seems to be no way to programmatically release the lock by calling a finished method; AFAICT the lock appears to be released when the wrapper is garbage collected.Is there anything that does this in the Java SE API, or is it considered easy enough just to roll something myself? Thanks for your constructive input.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
