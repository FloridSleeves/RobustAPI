For each line, it checks if the line contains both the username and password. If it does, it prints \"Login successful\" and returns. If it doesn't find a match after reading all lines, it prints \"Invalid credentials\"."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: How to read a specified String from an input file, then read the next word after it: :In Java I want to be able to have two JTextFields that take in String. One is a username and the other a password. to \"login\", the program will search through a file --> accounts.txt  and will search first for \"usrnm:\", once it finds it, it takes the word right after the :the same goes for the password but it searches for \"pswrd:\".Here's what iv'e got so far:    public void checkCredentials() {    try {        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(new File(\"accounts.txt\")));        String text = br.readLine();        text = text.toLowerCase();        text.split(\"usrnm:\");        System.out.println(\"username: \" + userInput);    } catch (Exception ex) {        ex.printStackTrace();    }}any help is appreciated!\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
