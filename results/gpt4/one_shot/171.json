The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Parent Last Classloader to solve Java Class path hell?: :I have a project which uses two versions of bouncyCastle jars bcprov-jdk15 and bcprov-jdk16. The jvm loads the older version but there is a feature I wrote which needs the newer version to run. I tried to solve this classpath hell by using a custom class loader. After some googling and with the help of some previous Stackoverflow answers[1] [2] and this blog,  I wrote the following Parent Last Class loader to load the classes from the newer jar before delegating to the parent class loader. public class ParentLastClassLoader extends ClassLoader {    private String jarFile; //Path to the jar file    private Hashtable classes = new Hashtable(); //used to cache already defined classes    public ParentLastClassLoader(ClassLoader parent, String path)    {        super(parent);        this.jarFile = path;    }    @Override    public Class<?> findClass(String name) throws ClassNotFoundException    {        System.out.println(\"Trying to find\");        throw new ClassNotFoundException();    }    @Override    protected synchronized Class<?> loadClass(String className, boolean resolve) throws ClassNotFoundException    {        System.out.println(\"Trying to load\");        try        {            System.out.println(\"Loading class in Child : \" + className);            byte classByte[];            Class result = null;            //checks in cached classes            result = (Class) classes.get(className);            if (result != null) {                return result;            }            try {                JarFile jar = new JarFile(jarFile);                JarEntry entry = jar.getJarEntry(className + \".class\");                InputStream is = jar.getInputStream(entry);                ByteArrayOutputStream byteStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();                int nextValue = is.read();                while (-1 != nextValue) {                    byteStream.write(nextValue);                    nextValue = is.read();                }                classByte = byteStream.toByteArray();                result = defineClass(className, classByte, 0, classByte.length, null);                classes.put(className, result);                return result;            } catch (Exception e) {                throw new ClassNotFoundException(className + \"Not found\", e);            }        }        catch( ClassNotFoundException e ){            System.out.println(\"Delegating to parent : \" + className);            // didn't find it, try the parent            return super.loadClass(className, resolve);        }    }}I loaded the main class in the feature with this class loader but the BouncyCaslte classes used in the feature are not loaded by my custom classloader. ClassLoader loader = new ParentLastClassLoader(Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader(), pathToJar);Class myClass = loader.loadClass(\"MainClassOfTheFeature\");Method mainMethod = myClass.getMethod(\"MainMethod\");mainMethod.invoke(myClass.getConstructor().newInstance());Jvm still uses the classes it loaded from the older version. How can I make the JVM to load the classes from my class loader when running the feature and use the already loaded older classes in the older jar when the feature is not running?Edit:The problem remains even after setting the custom classloader as the Thread context classloader in the MainMethod of the feature Main class.Thread.currentThread().setContextClassLoader(this.getClass().getClassLoader());\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
