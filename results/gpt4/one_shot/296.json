We submit each sorting task to an ExecutorService, which returns a Future. We then wait for each Future to complete using the get() method, which blocks until the computation is done. Once all the computations are done, we have a list of sorted arrays that we can merge. This approach allows us to start merging as soon as the first two threads are done."

My program then takes the array, splits into the amount of threads passed as an argument in the terminal, and gives each thread a piece of the array to sort, then stores all the threads in an array. Now, what I need some help with is this:I now want to take threads, as soon as they are done (Ie. if two are done before the others, they start to merge then wait for more). Think of it like braiding. I know how to write the sorting code for the merging, but what I hope you can help me with is this: How do I manage the threads? I know what wait() and notify() does, but I can't seem to be able to wrap my ead around what exactly I would need to do to make them merge into one array. Should I:Create a method inside the thread-class that merges the arrays?Create a new thread for every other thread that is done, pass the two sorted word-arrays as a parameter, and let that thread do the sorting?Something else I haven't thought of. I hope this was clear enough, and of good enough quality as the questions should be.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
