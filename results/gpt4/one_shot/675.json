You should pass the File object to the PrintWriter constructor. Also, you should use the write method of PrintWriter to write to the file. Remember to handle the FileNotFoundException which might be thrown when the specified file path does not exist."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: How to use PrintWriter and File classes in Java?: :I am trying to understand PrintWriter for a small program I'm making, and I cant seem to get java to make the file and then write on it. When I execute the program below it gives me a Filenotfoundexeption error on line 9. It also fails to make the file in the directory that I specified. I am new to this so please try and keep the answers simple. I am using Eclipse.import java.io.PrintWriter;import java.io.File;public class Testing {  public static void main(String[] args) {    File file = new File (\"C:/Users/Me/Desktop/directory/file.txt\");    PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter (\"file.txt\");    printWriter.println (\"hello\");    printWriter.close ();         }}\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
