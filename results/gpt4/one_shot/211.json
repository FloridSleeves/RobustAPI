The response is converted to a string and checked if it contains \"login: \". If it does, the username is sent. The same process is repeated for the password. If the response does not contain the expected string, the method continues to read from the input stream. This ensures that the program does not get stuck if the server takes some time to send the expected response."

The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Java telnet login: stuck after sending user name: :I'm trying to perform a programmatic telnet session in Java. I'm using commons-net TelnetClient, but I've also experimented with a direct socket. In either case I'm having the same problem.I read up to \"login :\", then send the user name followed by CRLF. Then nothing, no other data is read, or written by server.The telnet server is on an embedded device (a Star printer), so I'm wondering if there are some peculiar options required that I'm not setting, or that aren't supported by the commons-net TelnetClient class.I can use Linux telnet without problems, and I can run my code against the telnet server in OSX and it works fine.  TelnetClient client = new TelnetClient();  client.registerNotifHandler(new TelnetNotificationHandler() {    @Override    public void receivedNegotiation(int negotiation_code, int option_code) {      ALog.i(this, \"negotiation code: %d, option code: %d\", negotiation_code, option_code);    }  });  try {    client.addOptionHandler(new TerminalTypeOptionHandler(\"VT100\", false, false, true, false));    client.addOptionHandler(new SuppressGAOptionHandler(true, false, true, false));    client.addOptionHandler(new EchoOptionHandler(true, true, true, true));  } catch (InvalidTelnetOptionException e) {    e.printStackTrace();  }  try {    FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(\"/sdcard/spy.out\");    client.registerSpyStream(fos);  } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {    e.printStackTrace();  }  InputStream in = null;  PrintWriter out = null;  String ip = getIpAddress(p);  ALog.i(this, \"connecting to: %s\", ip);  try {    client.connect(ip);    in = client.getInputStream();    out = new PrintWriter(client.getOutputStream(), true);    if (!expect(in, \"login: \", 5000)) {      return;    }    if (!send(out, \"root\")) {      return;    }    if (!expect(in, \"password: \", 5000)) {      return;    }    if (!send(out, \"password\")) {      return;    }Here's the expect() and send() methods,  protected boolean expect(InputStream in, String s, long timeout) {    ALog.i(this, \"expecting: %s\", s);    final AtomicBoolean lock = new AtomicBoolean(false);    final ExpectThread t = new ExpectThread(in, s, lock, timeout);    t.start();    synchronized (lock) {      try {        lock.wait(timeout);      } catch (InterruptedException e) {      }    }    t.interrupt();    return lock.get();  }  protected boolean send(PrintWriter out, String s) {    out.println(s);    out.flush();    ALog.i(this, \"sent: %s\", s);    return true;  }And here's ExpectThread,  private class ExpectThread extends Thread {    private final InputStream in;    private final String expected;    private final AtomicBoolean lock;    private final long start;    private final long timeout;    ExpectThread(InputStream in, String expected, AtomicBoolean lock, long timeout) {      this.in = in;      this.expected = expected.toLowerCase();      this.lock = lock;      this.timeout = timeout;      this.start = System.currentTimeMillis();    }    @Override    public void run() {      final StringBuilder b = new StringBuilder();      final byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];      int c;      try {        while (!isInterrupted() && System.currentTimeMillis() < start + timeout) {          ALog.i(this, \"starting read ...\");          while ((c = in.read(buffer)) != -1) {            String s = new String(buffer, 0, c);            b.append(s.toLowerCase());            ALog.i(this, \"read string: %s, buffer: %s\", s, b.toString());            if (b.toString().contains(expected)) {              ALog.i(this, \"found expected\");              lock.set(true);              return;            }          }          ALog.i(this, \"waiting for read ...\");          SystemClock.sleep(1000);        }      } catch (IOException e) {        e.printStackTrace();      } finally {        synchronized (lock) {          lock.notifyAll();        }      }    }  }here's a wireshark pcap of the FAILED programmatic session,https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5iST80rpTN9c1RsRTNFaE5GZHM/view?usp=sharinghere's a pcap of a successful terminal (linux telnet client) session,https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5iST80rpTN9bDZFOHhkSHlPSE0/view?usp=sharingI see the Linux client sends a \"WILL AUTHENTICATE\", where my code does not. I'd try it if I could figure out how to get TelnetClient to send such commands.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
