If you read a file, modify its content in memory (like adding double spaces, indents, etc.), and then write it back to the file, you are both reading and writing the file. If you write the modified content to a new file, you are reading the original file and writing a new file. \n\nThe PrintWriter class is a high-level output stream that can be used to write formatted representations of objects to a text-output stream. It can be used to write characters, strings, and objects to the stream. \n\nIn the given code, a new PrintWriter object is created that writes to a file named \"the-file-name.txt\". Two lines of text are written to the file, and then the writer is closed. \n\nFileWriter is a class used for writing character files. The constructors of this class assume that the default character encoding and the default byte-buffer size are acceptable. To specify these values yourself, construct an OutputStreamWriter on a FileOutputStream. \n\nScanner is a simple text scanner which can parse primitive types and strings using regular expressions. It is typically used for reading user input or file content."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Reading a File versus Writing One: :This question is not specific question, but more a general question. For reading a file I know you can use Scanner and read it and then print it. However reading a file and then printing it in a new format, like double space, indents, basically any spacing issues, is that also considered reading it or is it writing it? From my understanding of what my teacher has taught me, is that writing overwrites the original document and replaces it. Also how does one use the PrintWriter command? I have never seen this before in my class nor have read about it in my textbook but its on my test according to my teacher. Could someone give an explanation and an example about it? I read this site http://www.caveofprogramming.com/frontpage/articles/java/java-file-reading-and-writing-files-in-java/ on writing files, but it uses FileWriter, which I'm assuming takes the place of scanner? Is that right?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
