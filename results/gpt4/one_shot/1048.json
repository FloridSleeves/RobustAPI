Here, we are using the StringTokenizer constructor that takes a string and a delimiter as parameters. The string is the one that we want to break into tokens and the delimiter is the character that separates the tokens in the string. In this case, the delimiter is '#'. The hasMoreTokens() method of StringTokenizer class is used to check if there are more tokens available from the string. If there are more tokens available, it returns true, otherwise it returns false. The nextToken() method is used to get the next token from the string. In the while loop, we are printing each token until there are no more tokens left."

Basically I have a string with 4 words in it, with each word seperated by a #. What I need to do is use the substring method to extract each word and print it out. I am having trouble figuring out the parameters for it though. I can always get the first one right, but the following ones generally have problems.Here is the first piece of the code:word = format.substring( 0 , format.indexOf('#') );Now from what I understand this basically means start at the beginning of the string, and end right before the #. So using the same logic, I tried to extract the second word like so:wordTwo = format.substring ( wordlength + 1 , format.indexOf('#') ); //The plus one so I don't start at the #.But with this I continually get errors saying it doesn't exist. I figured that the compiler was trying to read the first # before the second word, so I rewrote it like so:wordTwo = format.substring (wordlength + 1, 1 + wordLength + format.indexOf('#') );And with this it just completely screws it up, either not printing the second word or not stopping in the right place. If I could get any help on the formatting of this, it would be greatly appreciated. Since this is for a class, I am limited to using very basic methods such as indexOf, length, substring etc. so if you could refrain from using anything to complex that would be amazing! \nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
