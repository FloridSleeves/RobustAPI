The \"\\n\" is used to write a new line character after each line. This way, blank lines are ignored and not written to the output file."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: How can I ignore a blank line in a srt file using Java: :I have a srt file like below and I want to remove blank line : in line no 3**1Line1: 00:00:55,888 --> 00:00:57,875.
