This class allows you to create an InputStream from a byte array, which you can get from a String using the getBytes method. In the Struts2 action, you can set this InputStream as a property and access it from the result in the Struts2 configuration."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Return a text string as the response struts2: :hello all i got a tutorial for getting string/text as response from struts2 action class. it is from struts2 documentation and the link is tutorial. It is working. But my question is the StringBufferInputstream calss is deprecated. So can we use this class. if no so what is alternate for this. \nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
