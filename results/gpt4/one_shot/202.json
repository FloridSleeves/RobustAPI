In this case, it is used to read the bytes from the file. The read bytes are then used to calculate the checksum. The checksum is calculated by adding the 16 bit numbers (combined from two 8 bit ones). The '&= 0xFFFF' operation is used to ensure that the calculatedChecksum stays a 16 bit number. This is done because in Java, there is no unsigned int, so we need to ensure that the number does not exceed the maximum value for a 16 bit number."

The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Bit manipulation C source in Java: :I try to calculate the checksum of a Sega Genesis rom file in Java. For this i want to port a code snipped from C into Java:static uint16 getchecksum(uint8 *rom, int length){  int i;  uint16 checksum = 0;  for (i = 0; i < length; i += 2)  {    checksum += ((rom[i] << 8) + rom[i + 1]);  }  return checksum;}I understand what the code does. It sums all 16bit numbers (combined from two 8 bit ones). But what i didn't understand is what's happening with the overflow of the uint16 and how this transfers to Java code?Edit:This code seems to work, thanks:int calculatedChecksum = 0;int bufferi1=0;int bufferi2=0;bs = new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(this.file));bufferi1 = bs.read();bufferi2 = bs.read();while(bufferi1 != -1 && bufferi2 != -1){    calculatedChecksum += (bufferi1*256 + bufferi2);    calculatedChecksum = calculatedChecksum % 0x10000;    bufferi1 = bs.read();    bufferi2 = bs.read();}\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
