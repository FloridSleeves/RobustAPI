If the ArrayList does not exist (i.e., the key is not in the map), a new ArrayList is created and associated with the key. The value is then added to the ArrayList. This ensures that values are appended to the ArrayList instead of overwriting it."

Can you help me with this?\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Map.get\n<<<code>>>: import java.util.HashMap;import java.util.Map;Map<String, Integer> freq = new HashMap<String, Integer>();Integer count = freq.get(word);if (count == null) {freq.put(word, 1);}else {freq.put(word, count + 1);}\n<<<explanation>>>: If you look at the API for Map, get operations usually return null when the map does not contain the requested element. Note that this will make a solution.\nQuestion: Appending data to a subarray instead of having it overwritten with the latest entry: :I currently have a Map that is configured as such.Map<String, ArrayList<Object>> map = new HashMap<String, ArrayList<Object>>();where the purpose is to be able to have a setup much like the following:array(\"foo\"->array(1->\"aaa\",2->\"bbb\",3->\"ccc\"),      \"bar\"->array(1->\"aaa\",2->\"bbb\",3->\"ccc\"),      \"bah\"->array(1->\"aaa\",2->\"bbb\",3->\"ccc\"),)The problem I'm running into is that I can create the root array fine, but it will do the following, using the previous example as illustrationarray(\"foo\"->array(3->\"ccc\"),      \"bar\"->array(2->\"bbb\"),      \"bah\"->array(3->\"ccc\"),)What I'm trying to find out is how I can append the sub array as opposed to having it overwritten. I assume it's easily done I'm just missing something obvious.\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:"
