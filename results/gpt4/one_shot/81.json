However, you need to be careful about the order in which you use the streams. The ObjectOutputStream should be used first because it writes a header to the stream when it is created. After that, you can use the DataOutputStream and PrintWriter. Also, remember to flush the output stream after writing data to ensure that it is actually sent."

Is this possible and what is the best way to do it?I've tried just creating both types of objects, for example ObjectOutputStream and DataOutputStream, but that doesn't seem to work.The reason I want to switch between them is to, for example, send a text command \"INFO\" that signals I'm about to send an object with information or a command \"DATA\" signalling that I'm about to send data.  Any advice on the best way to do this is appreciated.\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:"
