The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Windows REG command not working when executed from ProcessBuilder in Java: :I'm trying to use Java to create a start up registry key and I'm getting a really weird result. On some OS's such as XP the command works flawlessly. However, on Windows 7 it only creates the key if you run the compiled jar or classes, and not from an applet on a web page. Additionally on Windows 8, the command does not work at all. I've tried debugging this, and it seems that the REG command is executing successfully. If I run the command manually from command prompt, it creates the keys, with the same output as when it's ran from inside the program. Heres an example of the code:public static int regadd(String key, String name, String val) throws IOException, InterruptedException {    ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder(new String[]{\"REG\", \"ADD\", key, \"/v\", name, \"/d\", val, \"/f\"});    pb.redirectOutput(new File(PathManager.getDirectory(), \"log0.txt\"));    int i = pb.start().waitFor();    Logger.log(\"ADD: \" + i);    return i;}In log0.txt it prints this:The operation completed successfully.Additionally, the \"result\" of the program prints ADD: 0So at this point, I am at a loss of what could be the problem. I am aware of the other dicey ways to add to the registry, but I would like to keep my code compatible with all VM distributions. Is there a way to accomplish this or fix the exiting method?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
