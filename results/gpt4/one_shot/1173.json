We then define a task that will run indefinitely, printing \"Task is running\" every second. We submit this task to the thread pool using threadPool.execute(task). Finally, we prevent the JVM from shutting down by adding an infinite loop in the main method. This loop does nothing but sleep for a second at a time, effectively keeping the JVM alive without consuming too much CPU."

I'm trying to have a multi threaded environment that stays active so that I can just submit tasks and run them. I want to do this without the hassle of executing in a web server or application server. The idea was to use a java thread pool for this, but the issue here is that the pool stays open just until my main method finishes, after which obviously it closes and the program finishes. How can I prevent this from happening? I'm sure there are several options, some more naive than others (while true loops come to mind). Any ideas? Thanks. \nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
