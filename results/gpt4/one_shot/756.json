However, you are not writing anything to the file. The PrintWriter.write method is used to write characters to the file. If you want to create an empty file, you can simply write an empty string to the file as shown in the code above."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: How Can I Create A File In Java?: :I am working on a program that needs a lot of app data. I am trying to create a function that creates a file with the path/file name of the string path. Here's my code:public static void CreateFile(String path) throws FileNotFoundException, UnsupportedEncodingException {    PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(path, \"UTF-8\");    writer.close();}What did I do wrong? Shouldn't it create a file? \nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
