This method will return true if and only if the specified object is also a list, both lists have the same size, and all corresponding pairs of elements in the two lists are equal. In other words, two lists are defined to be equal if they contain the same elements in the same order. If the elements of your list are custom objects, you need to override the equals() method in your class to define what is considered to be equal."

I don't care what's the difference, I just want to know if they're not the same.I'm fetching scores list from a database every minute, and only if the scores list that I fetched is different from the one I fetched a minute ago I want to send it to the client.Now the value of the ArrayList is actually a class that I created (that contains name, lvl, rank, score).Do I need to implement equals() on it?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
