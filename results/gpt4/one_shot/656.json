Can you help me with this?\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Map.get\n<<<code>>>: import java.util.HashMap;import java.util.Map;Map<String, Integer> freq = new HashMap<String, Integer>();Integer count = freq.get(word);if (count == null) {freq.put(word, 1);}else {freq.put(word, count + 1);}\n<<<explanation>>>: If you look at the API for Map, get operations usually return null when the map does not contain the requested element. Note that this will make a solution.\nQuestion: displaying content of Object of someother class, Acessing webservice object: :How do I access a object of some other class through my class??I tried toString but it can display contents only of its own object not other class objects. Basically, I am able to access Bugzilla Webservice API through java code(xmlrpc) and in return i get a object of class java.util.HashMap.But i am unable to understand how to access the object returned.    Object createResult = rpcClient.execute(\"Bug.search\", new Object[]{bugMap});how do i get bugs information from : \"createResult\" object.ie, contents of cretaeResult object.According to Bugzilla documentation two items are returned, bugs and faults, both are array of hashes. and i want to access these.\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:"
