However, you can use Java Reflection API to achieve this. First, you need to create a Map where the keys are the method names and the values are the Method objects. Then, in the loop, you can get the Method object from the Map using the concatenated string and call it using the invoke method. Note that this is a simplified example and actual usage would require handling exceptions and potentially dealing with method parameters and return values."

Can you help me with this?\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Map.get\n<<<code>>>: import java.util.HashMap;import java.util.Map;Map<String, Integer> freq = new HashMap<String, Integer>();Integer count = freq.get(word);if (count == null) {freq.put(word, 1);}else {freq.put(word, count + 1);}\n<<<explanation>>>: If you look at the API for Map, get operations usually return null when the map does not contain the requested element.
