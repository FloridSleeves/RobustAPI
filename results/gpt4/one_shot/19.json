Then, we find our ListView by its ID. We create an ArrayList and add some items to it. After that, we create an ArrayAdapter, which is a type of adapter that works well with ListViews and ArrayLists. We pass in the context (this), a layout for the individual items in the list (android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1), and the ArrayList. Finally, we set the adapter to the ListView. Now, the ListView will display the items from the ArrayList."

I am confused how does it work? why doesn't it give error just like we get in java code? and most importantly, how does environment decide to which component it needs to invoke? I understand the process of id generation is automated, which gets added to R.java For instance, if we have same IDs, say \"image1\" in two XMLs, say \"layout1\" & \"layout2\". but in R.java it won't have 2 IDs. that means at a time it will reference only 1 component. In case we have to use 2 XMLs in an Activity, one as activity.setcontentview(layout1) and another as a PopupWindow.setContentView(layout2). What will happen in such case?\nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Activity.setContentView\n<<<code>>>: @Override\npublic void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n    Button myButton = (Button) findViewById(R.id.my_button);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You can findViewById of the current view hierarchy set to the activity. You cannot have same id for the view's in the same view tree. (must be unique).\nQuestion: Populating a ListView using an ArrayList?: :My Android app needs to populate the ListView using the data from an ArrayList. I have trouble doing this.
