This method sets the length of this file. If the present length of the file as returned by the length method is greater than the newLength argument then the file will be truncated. In this case, if the file offset as returned by the getFilePointer method is greater than newLength then after this method returns the offset will be equal to newLength."

The last 6 bytes in my files contain crucial information when writing the files back. I need to write my original files, and then append the last 6 bytes elsewhere. Any guidance? Thanks\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: RandomAccessFile.read\n<<<code>>>: RandomAccessFile randomAccessFile = new RandomAccessFile(your_file, \"r\");randomAccessFile.seek(your_file.length() - n);try{randomAccessFile.read(byteArray, 0, n);} catch(IOException e) {e.printStackTrace();} \n<<<explanation>>>: You have to do it by using RandomAccessFile. Instances of this class support both reading and writing to a random access file. A random access file behaves like a large array of bytes stored in the file system. \nQuestion: File truncate operation in Java: :What is the best-practice way to truncate a file in Java? For example this dummy function, just as an example to clarify the intent:void readAndTruncate(File f, List<String> lines)        throws FileNotFoundException {    for (Scanner s = new Scanner(f); s.hasNextLine(); lines.add(s.nextLine())) {}    // truncate f here! how?}The file can not be deleted since the file is acting as a place holder.\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:"
