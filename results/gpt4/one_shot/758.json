This is not possible because a JSONObject represents a single JSON object, not an array of objects. Instead, you should convert your List of Maps into a JSONArray. This will create a JSON array where each element is a JSON object representing one of your Maps."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: List<Map<String,Object>> to org.json.JSONObject?: :List<Map<String, Object>> list = new ArrayList<Map<String, Object>>();Map<String, Object> map = new HashMap<String, Object>();map.put(\"abc\", \"123456\");map.put(\"def\", \"hmm\");list.add(map);JSONObject json = new JSONObject(list);try {    System.err.println(json.toString(2));} catch (JSONException e) {    e.printStackTrace();}What's wrong with this code?The output is:{\"empty\": false}\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
