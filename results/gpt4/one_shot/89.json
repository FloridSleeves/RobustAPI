When device B connects to this server socket, device A accepts the connection and creates a DataOutputStream to send data to device B. The data is sent using the writeUTF method. On device B, we create a client socket that connects to device A's server socket. We then create a DataInputStream to receive the data sent by device A. The received data is read using the readUTF method. After the data is sent and received, we close the connections. Please replace \"device_A_ip_address\" with the actual IP address of device A."
