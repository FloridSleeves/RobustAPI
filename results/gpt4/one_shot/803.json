The second parameter of FileWriter constructor is a boolean which when set to true, enables the append mode. This means that when you write using PrintWriter, the text will be appended to the existing content of the file instead of overwriting it."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Is there a File.AppendAllText() in Java?: :Is there some clean static method to just dump (append) a string to a file?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
