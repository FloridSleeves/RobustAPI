In this case, the get method is used to retrieve the values associated with the keys \"value_A\" and \"value_B\". Since the map is of type Object, Object, the returned values need to be cast to Long before the longValue method can be called on them. The casting is done by enclosing the get method call within parentheses and prefixing it with (Long). This tells the compiler to treat the returned object as a Long. The longValue method is then called on the result to convert the Long to a primitive long. The two resulting long values are then added together to give the total."

Can you help me with this?\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Map.get\n<<<code>>>: import java.util.HashMap;import java.util.Map;Map<String, Integer> freq = new HashMap<String, Integer>();Integer count = freq.get(word);if (count == null) {freq.put(word, 1);}else {freq.put(word, count + 1);}\n<<<explanation>>>: If you look at the API for Map, get operations usually return null when the map does not contain the requested element. Note that this will make a solution.\nQuestion: Java method chaining with casting on a single line: :I need to add two values together, and they are both stored as Longs in an object HashMap.This is what I'm trying to do, and my IDE says that it is an error.long total = currentRowContents.get(\"value_A\").longValue() + currentRowContents.get(\"value_B\").longValue(); I'm guessing this wont work because currentRowContents is a HashMap type Object, and so what is returned from currentRowContents.get(...) will need to be cast as type Long, then I can use the .longValue() method on it.I know that I can solve the issue by splitting it all up into separate statements and doing some casting. But I was wondering if there was a way of getting the above to work without splitting it up, and if it does need casting (which I'm sure it does) where to put it?EDITNot that it changes anything, but for those who'd like to know more, the answers that I have received do solve the problems. But the Hash Map I'm using is type Object, Object, though it is more used like String, Object, and it does contain data from a database. Unfortunately I can't change the Hash Map as it comes from a piece of purpose built framework that I cannot change.\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:"
