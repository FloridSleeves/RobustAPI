In Java, a String is an object that includes additional metadata, such as the length of the string, and each character in the string is stored as a 16-bit Unicode character. This is why the size in memory is larger than the size of the file on disk. On the other hand, C++ stores strings as a sequence of characters, which is why the size in memory is closer to the size of the file on disk. The getBytes() method is used to convert the String into a byte array, which can then be used to measure the size of the String in bytes."
