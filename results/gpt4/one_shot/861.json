This method blocks until all requested bytes are read, the end of the stream is detected, or an exception is thrown. \n\nIn your code, the first readFully reads 15 bytes into b1, and the file pointer advances by 15. Then, the second readFully reads the next 15 bytes into b2, and the file pointer advances by 15 again. Therefore, the two readFully calls read different parts of the file, and they don't give the same value.\n\nThe length of each value (firstname, lastname etc) is not guessed, but determined by the size of the byte array passed to readFully. In your code, both firstname and lastname are read as 15 bytes. If the actual length of the names is less than 15, the remaining bytes will be filled with spaces (if the file was written with writeChars or similar method). If the actual length is more than 15, the names will be truncated."

I wrote an alternative implementation for writeLong using a byte[]. Something like this:\n\nRandomAccessFile randomAccessFile = new RandomAccessFile(\"out.dat\", \"rwd\");\n...\nbyte[] aux = new byte[8];\naux[0] = (byte) ((l >>> 56) & 0xFF);\naux[1] = (byte) ((l >>> 48) & 0xFF);\naux[2] = (byte) ((l >>> 40) & 0xFF);\naux[3] = (byte) ((l >>> 32) & 0xFF);\naux[4] = (byte) ((l >>> 24) & 0xFF);\naux[5] = (byte) ((l >>> 16) & 0xFF);\naux[6] = (byte) ((l >>> 8) & 0xFF);\naux[7] = (byte) ((l >>> 0) & 0xFF);\nrandomAccessFile.write(aux);\n\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: RandomAccessFile.write\n<<<code>>>: {\n    RandomAccessFile raf = new RandomAccessFile(\"test.dat\", \"rwd\");\n    int longCount = 10000;\n    long start = System.nanoTime();\n    for (long l = 0; l < longCount; l++)\n        raf.writeLong(l);\n    long time = System.nanoTime() - start;\n    System.out.printf(\"writeLong() took %,d us on average%n\", time / longCount / 1000);\n    raf.close();\n}\n{\n    RandomAccessFile raf = new RandomAccessFile(\"test2.dat\", \"rwd\");\n    int longCount = 10000;\n    long start = System.nanoTime();\n    byte[] aux = new byte[8];\n    try {\n        for (long l = 0; l < longCount; l++) {\n            aux[0] = (byte) (l >>> 56);\n            aux[1] = (byte) (l >>> 48);\n            aux[2] = (byte) (l >>> 40);\n            aux[3] = (byte) (l >>> 32);\n            aux[4] = (byte) (l >>> 24);\n            aux[5] = (byte) (l >>> 16);\n            aux[6] = (byte) (l >>> 8);\n            aux[7] = (byte) l;\n            \n            raf.write(aux);\n            \n        }\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    }\n    long time = System.nanoTime() - start;\n    System.out.printf(\"write byte[8] took %,d us on average%n\", time / longCount / 1000);\n    raf.close();\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: It appears that the RandomAccessFile.writeLong() doesn't minimise the number of calls to the OS. The cost increases dramatically by using \"rwd\" instead of \"rw\" which should be enough to indicate its not the calls themselves which cost the time. (its the fact the OS is try to commit every write to disk and the disk only spins so fast)\nQuestion: reading data from a randomaccessfile: :Here is the function I have :// Read a record from the specified RandomAccessFile   public void read( RandomAccessFile file ) throws IOException    {      account = file.readInt();      byte b1[] = new byte[ 15 ];      file.readFully( b1 );      firstName = new String( b1, 0 );      firstName = firstName.trim();      byte b2[] = new byte[ 15 ];      file.readFully( b2 );      lastName = new String( b2, 0 );      lastName = lastName.trim();      balance = file.readDouble();   }I have to be able to read from a randomaccessfile for one of my exams and the code above is a bit confusing. here is what I am guessing is happening, would appreciate it if you could correct me if I am wrong.we take file in and readInt from the file and assign it to account. next I guess we create a new byte of size 15 and read the first name from the file into the byte and then assigned to firstname. now here is what I dont understand, what does readFully do? and how does the code above knows to move on to the next value for lastName.So simply put, byte b1[] = new byte[ 15 ];      file.readFully( b1 );      firstName = new String( b1, 0 );      firstName = firstName.trim();VS      byte b2[] = new byte[ 15 ];      file.readFully( b2 );      lastName = new String( b2, 0 );      lastName = lastName.trim();      balance = file.readDouble();Why doesnt it give the same value? are we guessing how long each value (firstname, lastname etc) is ?\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.write.\nAnswer:"
