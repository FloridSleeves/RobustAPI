When you call the method printStackTrace(ps), it writes the stack trace to the specified PrintWriter but it does not automatically flush the stream. You need to call ps.flush() to ensure that the data is actually written to the file."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: How do I print the exception stack trace: :package javaapplication1;import java.io.FileNotFoundException;import java.io.PrintWriter;public class multicatch {    public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException {            Throwable t = new Exception(\"Tis is some kind of throwable exception\");              PrintWriter ps=new PrintWriter(\"D:\\\\fff.txt\");  t.printStackTrace(ps);    }}This program creates \"fff.txt\" and it prints nothing in that file.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
