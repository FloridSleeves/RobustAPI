We then iterate over the map entries and check if the value of each entry is either a String or a List. If it's a List, we further check if all items in the list are Strings. If any of these conditions are not met, we throw an IllegalArgumentException. The getAttr method retrieves the value associated with a given key. If the value is a List, it returns the last item in the list; otherwise, it returns the value directly."

Maybe I'm going about this the wrong way, but let's see where this question goes :)I would like a Map container that contains either Strings or lists of Strings. I want to enforce this rule during construction of this object so that you can't create a map with values that aren't either of those.e.g.class Record {  public Record(String key, Map<String,Object> attrs) {    // check that attrs only contains Objects which are Strings or List<Strings>  }}Other ways I have thought of to solve the problem might be...1)class Record {  public Record(String key, Map<String,String> attrs, Map<String,List<String>> multiAttrs) {    // ...  }}2)class Record {  public Record(String key, Map<String,Value> attrs) {    // ...  }}class Value {  // Create some funky class that encapsulates lists.  // Perhaps returning the only element in the list if the size is 1,  // but returning the list otherwise}I am not immediately excited at the alternatives, but I'm just putting it there as stuff I've already considered. Really I want the distinction between Strings and List to be transparent to the user of the class.\nPlease using this api: List.get.\nAnswer:"
