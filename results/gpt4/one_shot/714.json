When the button is clicked, it creates a PrintWriter that writes to a file named \"tableData.txt\". It then loops through each row and column of the jTable, writing the value at each cell to the file, separated by commas. After each row, it writes a newline character. Finally, it closes the PrintWriter. This effectively saves the jTable data to a file."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: How to save changes made to jTable: :My question is , how to save changes made to jTable?I want to save changes made to jTable by adding save button in my program, but I don't know the source code of save button.Please Help , can anybody send me the source code of save button.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
