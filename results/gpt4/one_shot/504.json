Then it sorts the scores in descending order. It then iterates over the sorted scores, and for each score, it assigns the current rank to all positions where that score appears. The rank is then incremented by the number of positions that score appears at. This ensures that if multiple players have the same score, they get the same rank, and the next rank is skipped."

I want to get another array that gives me the ranking of the players based on their scores.For example: Given the scores {10,20,15,40}I want the ranking to be {4,2,3,1}The lowest score being rank 4 and the highest score being rank 1.The biggest problem is when there are multiple players with the same score. For example {10,10,20,40} then I want to get {34,34,2,1} (34 because the third and fourth place are shared by two players)Another example is {40,40,10,20}, which should give the ranking {12,12,4,3} (12 for shared first and second place)I have for the moment two dubble arrays to come to that result, but I think it can be better, but I don't find how. My biggest problem now is when we have 3 same scores: {40,40,40,10} than I should have the result {123,123,123,4}I hope you understand my question and of course can help me to find a solution.thanks\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
