The first loop is more commonly used and is more readable, which is generally more important than a negligible increase in performance. The second loop is not idiomatic and could be confusing to other developers. The performance difference you're seeing is likely due to other factors, such as JVM warmup, and not the loop construct itself."

Try to just use the value of the foreach inside the loop.\nQuestion: which loop is faster?: :I have this loopfor (it= someCollection.iterator; it.hasNext(); ){    //some code here}I changed it to:for (it= someCollection.iterator;; ){    if (!it.hasNext())        break;    //some code here}The second code ran a little bit faster in unit tests in junit on eclipse.Is the second loop faster? I'm asking because the times given by Junit are not too exact, but they give an approximate value\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
