Instead, you can use the System.getenv() method to get the system environment variable values. The \"PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE\" variable gives the processor architecture and the \"PROCESSOR_ARCHITEW6432\" variable gives the processor architecture when running under WOW64 on a 64-bit OS. If either ends with \"64\", then the system is 64-bit, otherwise it's 32-bit."

The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: How do I detect which kind of JRE is installed -- 32bit vs. 64bit: :During installation with an NSIS installer, I need to check which JRE (32bit vs 64bit) is installed on a system. I already know that I can check a system property \"sun.arch.data.model\", but this is Sun-specific. I'm wondering if there is a standard solution for this.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
