ObjectOutputStream is used for writing serialized objects, not plain text. It adds some metadata at the beginning of the stream, which is what you are seeing as unexpected characters. Instead, you should use PrintWriter to write your text to the response. This will not add any additional metadata, so the output will be exactly what you expect."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Unexpected character when downloading file client side from a servlet: :I create a servlet to download a specific text which the client post with a form before (in a textarea)... The form in the client side is nothing speciel:    form = new FormPanel();    form.setMethod(FormPanel.METHOD_POST);    form.setAction(GWT.getModuleBaseURL() + \"services/export\");    exportButton = new Button(resource.SUBMENU_Export(), new ClickHandler() {        public void onClick(ClickEvent event) {            form.submit();        }    });And this is the code at the server side (serlvet):    package com.server.servlet;    import java.io.IOException;    import java.io.ObjectOutputStream;    import java.io.OutputStream;    import javax.servlet.Servlet;    import javax.servlet.ServletException;    import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet;    import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;    import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;    public class ExportServlet extends HttpServlet implements Servlet {        private static final long serialVersionUID = 7526472295622776147L;          @Override        protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {            String expl = req.getParameter(\"Expl\");            response.setContentType(\"application/octet-stream\");            response.setHeader(\"Content-Disposition\", \"attachment; filename=hint.txt;\");            OutputStream stream = response.getOutputStream();            ObjectOutputStream objectStream = new ObjectOutputStream(stream);            objectStream.writeObject(expl);            objectStream.flush();        }    }but when i open the downloaded file, there are unexpected character only in the beginning in the file: \"`\u00ac\u00ed t\u010d-`\"I have no clue when write these characters to my file...\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
