You can't create an instance of a type parameter. You can only create instances of concrete classes. If you want to ensure that E has a constructor that takes a Bar, you can create a new interface that extends Bar and has a constructor that takes a Bar. Then, you can change your class definition to FooIterator<E extends YourNewInterface>. This way, you can ensure that E has a constructor that takes a Bar."

Try to just use the value of the foreach inside the loop.\nQuestion: Making assumptions about type parameters?: :I want to subclass Iterator into what I'll call FooIterator. My code looks something like this:public class FooIterator<E> implements Iterator<E> {  public FooIterator(Collection<Bar> bars) {    innerIterator = bars.iterator();  }  @Override  public boolean hasNext() {    return innerIterator.hasNext();  }  @SuppressWarnings(\"unchecked\")  @Override  public E next() {    Bar bar = innerIterator.next();    return new E(bar);  }  @Override  public void remove() {    throw new UnsupportedOperationException(\"Don't remove from FooIterator!\");  }  private Iterator<Bar> innerIterator;}...except, of course, this doesn't work because I can't instantiate a new E from a Bar.I would only ever use this with an E that has a constructor that takes a Bar. Is there any way to \"prove\" that to the compiler, or to just throw a runtime error if E doesn't have an appropriate constructor?Or perhaps I'm just not using the right design pattern here? I've been doing a lot of C++ recently, and I feel like I might be approaching this the wrong way.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
