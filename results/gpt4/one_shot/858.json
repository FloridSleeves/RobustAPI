The last 6 bytes in my files contain crucial information when writing the files back. I need to write my original files, and then append the last 6 bytes elsewhere. Any guidance? Thanks\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: RandomAccessFile.read\n<<<code>>>: RandomAccessFile randomAccessFile = new RandomAccessFile(your_file, \"r\");randomAccessFile.seek(your_file.length() - n);try{randomAccessFile.read(byteArray, 0, n);} catch(IOException e) {e.printStackTrace();} \n<<<explanation>>>: You have to do it by using RandomAccessFile. Instances of this class support both reading and writing to a random access file. A random access file behaves like a large array of bytes stored in the file system. \nQuestion: Read file and split into multiple files: :I have a file which I would like to read in Java and split this file into n (user input) output files. Here is how I read the file:int n = 4;BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"file.csv\"));try {    String line = br.readLine();    while (line != null) {        line = br.readLine();    }} finally {    br.close();}How do I split the file - file.csv into n files?Note - Since the number of entries in the file are of the order of 100k, I can't store the file content into an array and then split it and save into multiple files.\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:"
