The SQL statement is joining the \"clients\" and \"order\" tables on the \"id\" column and filtering for rows where the \"id\" is 2. The returned Cursor allows us to iterate over the result set and retrieve the data from each column for each row. The getColumnIndex() method is used to find the index of the column in the result set, and the getString() method is used to retrieve the data at that index."
