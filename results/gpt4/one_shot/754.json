The PrintWriter is initialized within a try-catch block to handle any IOException that may occur. The contents of the Vector are written to the file using an Iterator to traverse the Vector. After all the contents have been written, the PrintWriter is closed."

How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: How do i Dump contents of Vector into a new file?: :Here is my program to calculate prime numbers that are before 92. It works like a charm. I want my output to be put into a new file called VectorDump instead of it just being displayed on the regular screen. Where would I start this in my program here?
