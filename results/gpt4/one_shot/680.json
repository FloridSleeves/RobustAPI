It then compiles the written Java file using the javac command and runs the compiled program using the java command.

The waitFor method is used to make the current thread wait until the process represented by the Process object has terminated."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Programs that reproduces itself: :Is it possible to make a Java program that prints its source code to a new file, and compiles it, and runs the compiled program?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
