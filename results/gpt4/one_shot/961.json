The Pipe.open() method creates a new pipe. The Pipe.sink() method opens a sink channel for writing. The ByteBuffer class is used to write data to the pipe. The ByteBuffer.put() method writes the data to the buffer, and the SinkChannel.write() method writes the buffer to the pipe."

Thus I would like to know how to create a named pipe in Windows from Java. In Linux I can use mkfifo (called using Runtime.exec() ), but how should I do this on Windows?\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:"
