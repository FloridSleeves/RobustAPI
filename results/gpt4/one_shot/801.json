A better approach would be to read all the lines from the second file into a HashSet first. Then, for each line in the first file, you can simply check if it is in the HashSet. This is much faster because checking if a HashSet contains a certain value is a constant time operation, regardless of the size of the HashSet."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: what is the efficent way to process larges text files?: :I have two files:1- with 1400000 line or record --- 14 MB2- with 16000000 -- 170 MBI want to find if each record or line in file 1 is also in file 2 or notI develop a java app that do the following: Read file line by line and pass each line to a method that loop in file 2 Here is my code:  public boolean hasIDin(String bioid) throws Exception {    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"C://AllIDs.txt\"));    long bid = Long.parseLong(bioid);    String thisLine;    while((thisLine = br.readLine( )) != null)    {         if (Long.parseLong(thisLine) == bid)            return true;    }        return false;    }public void getMBD() throws Exception{     BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"C://DIDs.txt\"));     OutputStream os = new FileOutputStream(\"C://MBD.txt\");     PrintWriter pr = new PrintWriter(os);     String thisLine;     int count=1;     while ((thisLine = br.readLine( )) != null){         String bioid = thisLine;         System.out.println(count);         if(! hasIDin(bioid))                pr.println(bioid);     count++;     }    pr.close();}  When I run it seems it will take more 1944.44444444444 hours to complete as every line processing takes 5 sec. That is about three months!Is there any ideas to make it done in a much much more less time.Thanks in advance.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
