For every 2000 lines, it creates a new output file. The PrintWriter.write method is used to write each line to the current output file. After 2000 lines have been written, the current output file is closed and a new one is opened. This continues until all lines from the input file have been read."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Split Flat File using Java: :I am fairly new to java and need some help.  I have flat file with 10 columns and a total of, lets say, 9750 rows.  All the rows are pipe delimited.  I need to split the file into 2000 rows each (5 files). How do I do this in Java?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
