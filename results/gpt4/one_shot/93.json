In your case, you need to set the \"Transfer-Encoding\" header to \"chunked\" and the \"Trailer\" header to the name of the trailer you want to send. After writing your data to the output stream, you need to write a zero-length chunk to signify the end of the chunked data, followed by your trailer and an extra CRLF to signify the end of the trailers."
