Therefore, you can't directly translate the Scala code to Java. However, you can achieve a similar effect by using a BiFunction with the same type for all three type parameters. This will allow you to apply the function to the first element and each subsequent element in the collection. The result of the function application is then used as the first argument for the next application, and so on, until all elements have been processed. This is essentially what the reduceLeft method does in Scala."

Try to just use the value of the foreach inside the loop.\nQuestion: Java 'reduceLeft' signature / Lower-bounded Type Arguments: :The following signature is valid and commonly used in Scala:trait Collection[A] {    def reduceLeft [B >: A] (f: (B, A) => B): B}However, since >: is the Scala equivalent of super in Java, my first idea to convert this signature (replacing the function type with BiFunction and making use of Use-Site variance annotations aka Bounded Wildcards) would beinterface Collection<A> {    <B super A> B reduceLeft(BiFunction<? super B, ? super A, ? extends B> mapper)}But oh no! The compiler complains about the super token in <B super A> because you can't have lower-bounded type variables! Now how would I write this method in Java code without having to time-travel back to when generics didn't exist in the Java world?Yes, I know that you think I could use B extends A, but that is not the same thing, as shown by my implementation:public <R extends E> R reduceLeft(BiFunction<? super R, ? super E, ? extends R> mapper){    if (this.isEmpty())    {        return null;    }    Iterator<E> iterator = this.iterator();    R first = iterator.next(); // doesn't work, but would if R was a super-type of E (R super E)    while (iterator.hasNext())    {        mapper.apply(first, iterator.next());    }    return first;}Instead, I had to use this slightly more restricted version:public E reduceLeft(BiFunction<? super E, ? super E, ? extends E> mapper){    if (this.isEmpty())    {        return null;    }    Iterator<E> iterator = this.iterator();    E first = iterator.next();    while (iterator.hasNext())    {        first = mapper.apply(first, iterator.next());    }    return first;}\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
