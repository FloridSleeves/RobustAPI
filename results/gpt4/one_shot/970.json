I'm trying to achieve this with a socket connection. (port 6000)Now, at first flash was able to connect, but it just sends <policy-file-request/>. After this nothing happens.Now, some people at Kirupa suggested to send an cross-domain-policy xml as soon as any connection is established from the java side. http://www.kirupa.com/forum/showthread.php?t=301625However, my java server just throws the following:End Exception: java.net.SocketException: Software caused connection abort: recv failedI've already spend a great amount of time on this subject, and was wondering if anyone here knows what to do?\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:"
