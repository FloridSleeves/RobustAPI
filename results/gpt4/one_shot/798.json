Instead, you are writing the input stream of the console to the file, which is not what you want. You should write the text of each paragraph to the file inside the loop. Also, you should add a newline character (\"\\n\") after each paragraph to ensure that each paragraph is written on a new line in the file."

But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: write the console output to a text file using jsoup: :I wanted to write the console output to a text file but somehow it only writes one line to my text file.
