The FileWriter's write method does not automatically flush the output stream, which means that the data may not be immediately written to the file. By using the PrintWriter's write method and adding a newline character (\"\\n\") after each write, you ensure that each string is written and flushed to the file immediately, and that each string appears on a new line in the file."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: How to write text to a file in Java: :I'm new to java and currently trying to write some strings into a text file using this tut :http://www.homeandlearn.co.uk/java/write_to_textfile.htmlso here is my code :public void savefile() throws IOException {          JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null,\"Hi,i'm in Try Block :|\");    FileWriter write = new FileWriter(\"asd.txt\", true);    PrintWriter print = new PrintWriter(write);    JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, \"File Opened\");    write.write(\"Knock Knock\");    print.flush();    print.write(\"Hello ?\");    print.flush();    print.printf(\"Hi?\");    print.flush();    print.println(\"anybody there?\");    print.flush();    JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, \"Can you hear me ?\");    print.close();    JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, \"File Closed\");         }and this is how I call the method:try {    savefile();}catch (IOException e) {    JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, \"Error: \" + e.getMessage());}But nothing appears in the file! I'm really sick of this; what did I do wrong?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
