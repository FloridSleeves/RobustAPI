That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Java Replace words within xml: :I have the following xml<some tag>    <some_nested_tag attr=\"Hello\"> Text </some_nested_tag>    Hello world Hello Programming</some tag>From the above xml, I want to replace the occurances of the word \"Hello\" which are part of the tag content but not part of tag attribute.I want the following output (Replacing Hello by HI):<some tag>    <some_nested_tag attr=\"Hello\"> Text </some_nested_tag>    HI world HI Programming</some tag>I tried java regex and also some of the DOM parser tutorials, but without any luck. I am posting here for help as I have limited time available to fix this in my project. Help would be appreciated.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
