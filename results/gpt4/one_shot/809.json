This endpoint can be used as the source for your jQuery autocomplete. When a user types into the input field, a GET request is made to the endpoint with the current input as the term parameter. The endpoint then returns a list of LDAP results that match the term, which are used as the autocomplete suggestions."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Spring 3, ldap and Query autocomplete text field: :I would like to have an autocompliting input (text) field on my Spring 3 form. The suggested values should come from ldap. I should use JQuery for this, but so far that's all I know. I have found some examples with data txt.files, but not ldap.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
