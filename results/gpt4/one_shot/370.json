Elements in a Set are not arranged in any specific order. They are arranged as per the implementation of the Set. For example, in a HashSet, they are arranged according to the hashcode of the elements. Therefore, accessing an element by an index does not make sense for a Set. If you need to access elements in a specific order, consider using a List or a SortedSet. However, you can still retrieve the first element from a Set using an Iterator and the next() method, as shown in the code."

(other than using an iterator)I'm sure the fact that it's excluded from the API means there's a good reason for not doing this -- could someone please enlighten me?EDIT:Some extremely great answers here, and a few saying \"more context\".  The specific scenario was a dbUnit test, where I could reasonably assert that the returned set from a query had only 1 item, and I was trying to access that item.However, the question is more valid without the scenario, as it remains more focussed:What's the difference between set and list.Thanks to all for the fantastic answers below.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
