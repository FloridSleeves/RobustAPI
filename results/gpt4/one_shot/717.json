In your case, if you are using PrintWriter's println method to write data, the response is not immediately flushed or committed. It will be committed once the buffer is full or when you explicitly call the flush() method. If you forward the request before flushing or committing the response, the uncommitted output in the response buffer will be cleared."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: when is servlet response committed or flushed?: :According to javadoc:in-request.getRequestDispatcher(\"/Test\").forward(request,response);forward should be called before the response has been committed to the  client (before response body output has been flushed).Uncommitted output in the response buffer is automatically cleared before the forward.I am getting confused when this response is committed or been flushed?is this writing in println of printwriter.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
