It then iterates over the values in the map, and if a value is exactly 2 (meaning the number appears exactly twice in the array), it increments the count of unique pairs. This is more efficient than the original code because it only requires two passes over the data: one to build the frequency map, and one to count the unique pairs."

Can you help me with this?\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Map.get\n<<<code>>>: import java.util.HashMap;import java.util.Map;Map<String, Integer> freq = new HashMap<String, Integer>();Integer count = freq.get(word);if (count == null) {freq.put(word, 1);}else {freq.put(word, count + 1);}\n<<<explanation>>>: If you look at the API for Map, get operations usually return null when the map does not contain the requested element. Note that this will make a solution.\nQuestion: Efficient way to count unique pairs in int array: :This is my first post, hope it complies with posting guidelines of the site.First of all a generic thanks to all the community: reading you from some months and learned a lot :o)Premise: I'm a first years student of IT.Here's the question: I'm looking for an efficient way to count the number of unique pairs (numbers that appear exactly twice) in a given positive int array (that's all I know), e.g. if:int[] arr = {1,4,7,1,5,7,4,1,5};the number of unique pairs in arr is 3 (4,5,7).I have some difficulties in... evaluating the efficiency of my proposals let's say.Here's the first code I did:int numCouples( int[] v ) {int res = 0;int count = 0;for (int i = 0 ; i < v.length; i++){    count = 0;    for (int j = 0; j < v.length; j++){        if (i != j && v[i] == v[j]){            count++;        }    }    if (count == 1){        res++;    }}return res/2;}This shoudn't be good cause it checks the whole given array as many times as the number of elements in the given array... correct me if I'm wrong.This is my second code:int numCouples( int[] v) {int n = 0;int res = 0;for (int i = 0; i < v.length; i++){    if (v[i] > n){        n = v[i];    }}int[] a = new int [n];for (int i = 0; i < v.length; i++){    a[v[i]-1]++;}for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++){    if (a[i] == 2){        res++;    }}return res;}I guess this should be better than the first one since it checks only 2 times the given array and 1 time the n array, when n is the max value of the given array. May be not so good if n is quite big I guess...Well, 2 questions:am I understanding good how to \"measure\" the efficiency of the code?there's a better way to count the number of unique pairs in a given array?EDIT:Damn I've just posted and I'm already swamped by answers! Thanks! I'll study each one with care, for the time being I say I don't get those involving HashMap: out of my knowledge yet (hence thanks again for the insight:o) )\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:"
