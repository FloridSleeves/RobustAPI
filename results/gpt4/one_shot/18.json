Then, we use a Handler to delay the execution of a piece of code (in this case, setting the visibility of the TextView to VISIBLE) by 7 seconds (7000 milliseconds). This will make the TextView visible again after 7 seconds."

I am confused how does it work? why doesn't it give error just like we get in java code? and most importantly, how does environment decide to which component it needs to invoke? I understand the process of id generation is automated, which gets added to R.java For instance, if we have same IDs, say \"image1\" in two XMLs, say \"layout1\" & \"layout2\". but in R.java it won't have 2 IDs. that means at a time it will reference only 1 component. In case we have to use 2 XMLs in an Activity, one as activity.setcontentview(layout1) and another as a PopupWindow.setContentView(layout2). What will happen in such case?\nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Activity.setContentView\n<<<code>>>: @Override\npublic void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n    Button myButton = (Button) findViewById(R.id.my_button);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You can findViewById of the current view hierarchy set to the activity. You cannot have same id for the view's in the same view tree. (must be unique).\nQuestion: TextVisibility change after a period of time: :, I have just started learning java for android, I have set the TextVisibility of a textfield to GONE, I need the TextVisibilty to change to VISIBLE after 7 seconds from Button click, I had searched the internet and could not find anything useful or I could'nt understand.
