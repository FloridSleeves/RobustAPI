The return value is a long value representing the time the file was last modified, measured in milliseconds since the epoch (00:00:00 GMT, January 1, 1970), or 0L if the file does not exist or if an I/O error occurs. This method does not throw any exception. If the file is open by other programs such as excel or word and you're closing the file without any changes, the lastModified() value may change due to the way these programs handle files."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: get file modification time: :i want to write a code for monitoring file changes and reacting to changes.so i write a TimerTask to periodically check the modification of filebut i have a problem:when file is open by other programs such as excel or word and i'm closing the filewithout any changes,value  File.lastModified() is changing.i am also trying to get modification date by running dir shell script, it's work fine butit only has minute accuracy!can any one help me?thanks\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
