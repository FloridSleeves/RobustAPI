This is known as covariance. For example, if you have a list of Integer, you can still pass it to a method that requires a list of Number, because Integer is a subtype of Number. If the method signature was Collection<T>, you could only pass a Collection<T>, not a Collection of any subtype of T. This is a key aspect of generics in Java, allowing for more flexible and reusable code."

Try to just use the value of the foreach inside the loop.\nQuestion: Signature of Collections.min/max method: :In Java, the Collections class contains the following method:public static <T extends Object & Comparable<? super T>> T min(Collection<? extends T> c)Its signature is well-known for its advanced use of generics,so much that it is mentioned in the Java in a Nutshell bookand in the official Sun Generics Tutorial.However, I could not find a convincing answer to the following question:Why is the formal parameter of type Collection<? extends T>, ratherthan Collection<T>? What's the added benefit?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
