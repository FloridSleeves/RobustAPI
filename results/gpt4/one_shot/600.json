When ActivityTwo finishes, it returns the result to MainActivity's onActivityResult method. In this method, you get the result from the Intent, find the instance of MyFragment, and call its processResult method, passing the result to it. In MyFragment's processResult method, you can then do whatever you need to do with the result."
