The Iterator's next method will return the next StudentObj in your list each time it's called. This way, each call to getStudentInfo will return the next student in the list. However, please note that this will not work if you have multiple threads calling getStudentInfo at the same time, as they will all share the same iterator. If you need to support multiple threads, you will need to implement some form of synchronization."

I am using Hibernate (to which I am relatively new) on top of oracle database.I was thinking in lines of locking student1 row and returning that row, but I am not very conversant with locking in hibernate.On Client Side time t1: getStudentInfo() (work on student1) |  getStudentInfo() //Call concurrently (work on student2)time t1+10sec: getStudentInfo (work on student3)time t1+20sec: getStudentInfo (work on student4)First call should be able to work on student1 and second concurrent call should be able to work on student2.Edit: Made changes based on comments. ( I cannot edit the query and clients getStudentInfo cannot pass the id if that helps).\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
