This should reduce the stall during output as the audio is being read and written in smaller chunks rather than all at once. However, if the stall persists, you may need to consider using a separate thread for audio output to prevent it from blocking the main game loop."

The last 6 bytes in my files contain crucial information when writing the files back. I need to write my original files, and then append the last 6 bytes elsewhere. Any guidance? Thanks\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: RandomAccessFile.read\n<<<code>>>: RandomAccessFile randomAccessFile = new RandomAccessFile(your_file, \"r\");randomAccessFile.seek(your_file.length() - n);try{randomAccessFile.read(byteArray, 0, n);} catch(IOException e) {e.printStackTrace();} \n<<<explanation>>>: You have to do it by using RandomAccessFile. Instances of this class support both reading and writing to a random access file. A random access file behaves like a large array of bytes stored in the file system. \nQuestion: Fast Audio File Output: :I've recently finished a small game and have been trying to add audio to it. Currently the sound system I have is working (basically the same code as the top answer here), but there is a significant stall during every output (~200-300 ms). Since it's a quick game I'm looking for something significant quicker. I'm not experienced with Threads, but would those be applicable here?\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:"
