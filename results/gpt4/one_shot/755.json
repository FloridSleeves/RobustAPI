This means that the BufferedReader on the server side is waiting for a newline to know when to stop reading. By manually appending a newline to the end of the stream on the client side after the call to props.store(out, null), you signal to the server that it has reached the end of the stream and it can stop reading. The flush() method is called to ensure that the newline is actually sent over the socket before the client stops executing."

But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Java streaming Properties over Socket: :First of all, this is a homework problem. That being said, I'm stuck. Googling for java Properties over Sockets results in a lot of irrelevant things. I'm trying to transfer a Properties object over a socket. The API says it can be done with a Stream or a Writer/Reader, but I can't get it to work. I can do it manually, that is, if I read the file line by line and pass it through a PrintWriter.On the client side I've got roughly:socket = new Socket(host, port);outStream = socket.getOutputStream();out = new PrintWriter(outStream, true);in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file));...props.load(reader);props.store(out, null);On the server side the receiving bits look like:out = new PrintWriter(sock.getOutputStream(), true);inStream = sock.getInputStream();in = new BufferedReader( new InputStreamReader(inStream));...props.load(in); // hangs// doesn't get to code here...In this case it hangs at the props.load(in). Instead of doing props.load(in), I read it in line by line to make sure props.store(out, null) was working, and the data looks like its being transferred.Is there something about load/store I don't understand, or is it an issue with the Stream/Writer/Reader?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
