It uses a random number generator to decide whether to place a 0 or a 1 at each position in the array. However, it also keeps track of how many of each number it has placed in the array so far. If it has placed more of one number than the other, it will place the other number to keep the counts even. If the counts are equal, it will choose a number at random. This ensures that the final array will have an equal number of 0s and 1s."

Try to just use the value of the foreach inside the loop.\nQuestion: Creating an even amount of randomness in an array: :Let's say that you have an arbitrarily large sized two-dimensional array with an even amount of items in it. Let's also assume for clarity that you can only choose between two things to put as a given item in the array. How would you go about putting a random choice at a given index in the array but once the array is filled you have an even split among the two choices?If there are any answers with code, Java is preferred but other languages are fine as well.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
