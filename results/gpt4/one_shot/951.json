The input string is first converted to bytes using the getBytes() method. Then, the Cipher class is used to perform the encryption. The encrypted bytes are then encoded into a string using Base64 encoding. Please note that you need to handle the exceptions appropriately in your code."

I've been stucked for a week doing some research in it. I really appreciate if you have sample source code or function method for Algorithm AES and Algorithm Twofish in java that I may use in my project. I really need your help ... hope someone out there could be my savior. Thanks very much.\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:"
