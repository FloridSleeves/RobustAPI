However, since the map is not guaranteed to be a SortedMap, it's safer to use the keySet().iterator().next() method to get the key. This will work for any type of map. Once you have the key, you can use the map.get(key) method to get the corresponding value."

In some clearly identified cases, the map only contains one key-value pair, effectively only being a wrapper for the two objects.Is there an efficient / elegant / clear way to access both the key and the value? It seems overkill to iterate over the one-element entry set. I'm looking for somehing that would lower the brain power required for people who will maintain this, along the lines of:(...)// Only one result.else {    A leKey = map.getKey(whicheverYouWantThereIsOnlyOne); // Is there something like this?    B leValue = map.get(leKey); // This actually exists. Any Daft Punk reference was non-intentional.}Edit: I ended up going with @akoskm solution's below. In the end, the only satisfying way of doing this without iteration was with a TreeMap, and the overhead made that unreasonable. It turns out there is not always a silver bullet, especially as this would be a very small rabbit to kill with it.\nPlease using this api: SortedMap.firstKey.\nAnswer:"
