However, it can be used to write commands to the command prompt (cmd) using a Process object. In this case, the command to start Microsoft Access and execute a specific macro is written to the command prompt. The \"exit\" command is then written to close the command prompt. The process is then made to wait until the execution of the command is completed."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: How to run Microsoft access macro from Java: :Closed.
