This makes it accessible to all methods in the class. In the main method, we initialize the PrintWriter to write to a file. We then use the PrintWriter's write method to append text to the file in the main method and in other methods. The PrintWriter is closed in a finally block to ensure it gets closed even if an exception is thrown. The FileOutputStream is opened in append mode (the second argument to its constructor is true), so each write will append to the file rather than overwriting it."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Making a text file available to all methods in Java: :I have a simple single Java file, that has main method and a bunch of other methods. I'd like to open a text file in my main method but keep it open and append to it in my other methods in my java code. what is the best way of doing it in Java. \nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
