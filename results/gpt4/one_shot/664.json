But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Java: :This question already has answers here:                                                            How do I create a file and write to it?                                (35 answers)                            Closed 8 years ago.I'm trying to write a program that writes a listing of things to a *.txt file, and everything appears to be all good and well but nothing is written in the txt file. Any help is appreciated. I won't post my code on here because it's only a small fraction, but I'm using a formatter in the form Formatter fileMaker = new Formatter(\"file.txt\"); and then I would do something like fileMaker.format(%s, String str); but nothing turns up in the file? Thanks for the help.   Hopefully this little bit might help, maybe I'm doing something wrong that I don't see, but I declared it as private static Formatter fileMaker; in the class and then I implement it like below.fileMaker.format(\"%s%d\\n\", \"#flightCount\", flights2.size());    for(int i=0; i<flights2.size(); i++){        fileMaker.format(\"%s %s%s%d%d %d \", \"#newFlight\", flights2.get(i).getSourceAirport(), flights2.get(i).getDestinationAirport(),                flights2.get(i).getTakeoffTime(), flights2.get(i).getLandingTime(), flights2.get(i).getCapacity());    }\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
