This is not a good idea for large files as it can cause OutOfMemoryErrors. Instead, you should read a chunk of the file into a buffer, send that buffer, and then repeat until the entire file has been sent. This way, you only need to have a small part of the file in memory at any one time. The buffer size of 1024 bytes is just an example, you can adjust it to a size that gives you the best performance."

The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Files don't transfer completely: :I'm trying to send a file from client to the server, but only ~8kb of lager files(~100kb) transferred. And pngs for example are not completely viewable.I really don't know why it stops earlier.Sending small testfiles(~1 kb) works great.The server part:                    ServerSocket fileSocket = new ServerSocket(p);                    boolean rdy = false;                    while (!rdy) {                        Socket client = fileSocket.accept();                        String fileName = \"C:/\" + args[2];                        String cmd = fileName + \"\\n\";                        OutputStreamWriter sWriter = new OutputStreamWriter(client.getOutputStream());                        sWriter.write(cmd, 0, cmd.length());                        sWriter.flush();                        InputStream inStream = client.getInputStream();                        FileOutputStream fileStream = new FileOutputStream(fileName);                        byte[] buffer = new byte[client.getReceiveBufferSize()];                        int bytesRead = 0;                        while ((bytesRead = inStream.read(buffer)) > 0) {                            fileStream.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);                        }                        fileStream.flush();                        ta.append(\"File transfered\");                        inStream.close();                        fileStream.close();                        rdy = true;                    }                    fileSocket.close();                    return;The client part:Socket client = new Socket(ip, port);        OutputStream outStream = client.getOutputStream();        FileInputStream fileStream = new FileInputStream(fileName);        byte[] buffer = new byte[(int) fileStream.getChannel().size()];        int bytesRead = 0;        System.out.println(\"Sending file: \" + fileName);        while ((bytesRead = fileStream.read(buffer)) > 0) {            outStream.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);        }        outStream.close();        fileStream.close();        client.close();        return;\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
