In this code, we're creating a new RandomAccessFile object and reading the first 100 bytes from the file into a byte array. Then, we're creating a new ByteArrayInputStream from the byte array. This InputStream will only contain the first 100 bytes of the file."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I create constrained InputStream to read only part of the file?: :I want to create an InputStream that is limited to a certain range of bytes in file, e.g. to bytes from position 0 to 100. So that the client code should see EOF once 100th byte is reached.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
