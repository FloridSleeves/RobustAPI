The Iterator.remove() method removes the last element returned by the iterator. It can be called only once per call to next(). The break statement is used to exit the current loop and resume execution at the next statement after the loop. This is necessary because after removing an element from the list, we should not continue checking the remaining ammo for the removed enemy."

I am trying to make it so that if the enemies are within a certain distance of the ammos, then the enemys remove themselves from the screen. I have attempted to do it and the code compiles, but i am unsure why the enemys arent being removed from the screen once been hit. Can anyone see anything wrong with the code below? Thankyoufor (TopEnemy i : newTopEnemy){    for (int q = 0; q < ammo.length; q++)    {       float xsubs = i.enemyX - ammo[q].positionX;       float ysubs = i.enemyY - ammo[q].positionY;       float squared = (xsubs * xsubs) + (ysubs * ysubs);       float distance = (float)Math.sqrt(squared);       if (distance < 10.0)       {          newTopEnemy.remove(q);       }    } }  \nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
