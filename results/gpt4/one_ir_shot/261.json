The Iterator.next() method is used to iterate over the collection of Player objects. In each iteration, the virtualPlayerCount is incremented by 1. At the end of the loop, the virtualPlayerCount holds the count of online players. This count may not reflect the actual number of players online, but it can be used as a virtual count."

I Thing to set a virtual number for the max Player Count I can use the Method setMaxPlayers(int mxPlayers) from the ServerListPing Event. But what about the online Players? And does it also work if I try to get the Players via a query in a plugin?Thank you for your help and sorry for my bad English ;)\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
