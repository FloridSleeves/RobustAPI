When the button is clicked, it creates a PrintWriter object that writes to a file named \"tableData.txt\". It then loops through each cell in the jTable, writes the value of the cell to the file, and separates each value with a comma. After writing all the values in a row, it writes a newline character to start a new line for the next row. After writing all the jTable data, it closes the PrintWriter. If the file is not found, it will print the stack trace of the FileNotFoundException."
