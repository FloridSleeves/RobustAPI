It then seeks to the end of the file and starts reading backwards one byte at a time. When it encounters a newline character ('\\n'), it stops reading. The bytes read are converted to characters and appended to the beginning of the lastLine string. This way, the last line of the file is read in reverse order. Finally, the last line is printed out."

This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Cant find the newline character in a file (java): :I am trying to get the last line of a file, but my output shows that it never finds it. I also tried looking for \"[\" which all the lines start with, but unless the jumps were perfect the program will not skip \"[\". I tried looking for \"\\r\\n\", System.getProperty(\"line.separator\"), \\r and \\n. Most probably its a dumb mistake, but if I had it and I couldn't find it, then someone else may run into it too.         RandomAccessFile raf = new RandomAccessFile(fileLocation, \"r\");        //Finds the end of the file, and takes a little more        long lastSegment = raf.length() - 5;        //**Looks for the new line character \\n?**        //if it cant find it then take 5 more and look again.        while(stringBuffer.lastIndexOf(\"\\n\") == -1)  {            lastSegment = lastSegment-5;            raf.seek(lastSegment);            //Not sure this is the best way to do it            String seen = raf.readLine();            stringBuffer.append(seen);        }        //Trying to debug it and understand        int location = stringBuffer.lastIndexOf(\"\\n\");        System.out.println(location);        FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(fileLocation);        InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(fis, \"UTF8\");        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);        br.skip(lastSegment);        System.out.println(\"br.readLine() \" + br.readLine());}The idea from the code comes from Quickly read the last line of a text file?The file I use is thishttp://www.4shared.com/file/i4rXwEXz/file.htmlThanks for the help, and if you see any other places where my code could be improve let me know\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:"
