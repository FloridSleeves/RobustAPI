It then uses an Iterator to traverse the Set. The next() method of the Iterator is used to get the next element in the Set. The StringBuilder is used to build the final String, appending the delimiter and the next element in each iteration. The String.valueOf() method is used to convert the elements to String."

This is a special case of a reduction.

And I know I can do it in separate functions using a loop. But I just don't want to be tedious and want to do it in one function using Java Generics or whatever that can help. I have done some brain storm but in vain. :(Any idea is appreciated!\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
