In this case, we are using the ordinal() method to get the position of the current enum constant, adding 1 to it, and then using the modulus operator (%) with the total number of enum constants to ensure that the result wraps around to the beginning of the enum when it reaches the end. This allows for cyclic traversal of the enum."
