This means that you can only iterate over Strings, not any other object. In the former, you could potentially put any Object into your Iterator which could lead to ClassCastException at runtime. The next() method of Iterator is used to get the next element in the iteration."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How shall I declare Iterator?: :Which form is preferred:String my = \"Which form shall I use?\";Iterator iter = my.iterator();or  Iterator<String> iter = my.iterator();I personally preferr the former but in my materials from uni they use the latter.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
