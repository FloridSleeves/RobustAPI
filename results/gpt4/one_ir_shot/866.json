The 'seek' method is used to move the file pointer to the end of the file (raf.length()). This allows you to append data to the end of the file without having to decrypt the entire file. Please note that this method does not handle the encryption itself, you need to encrypt your data before writing it to the file."

Unfortunately, cryptography is not my strong side. Now I can write to file several messages and then close file. Then i can open it, append some messages, close again and after decryption I see padding bytes in the middle of file. Is there any way to work with encrypted file without having to decrypt it every time I want to append some messages?EDIT: little more details. Current implementation utlizes CipherOutputStream. As i understand there's no way to seek using it.Can i use 'NoPadding' option if i will control that output data size is divisible by block size?\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.write.\nAnswer:"
