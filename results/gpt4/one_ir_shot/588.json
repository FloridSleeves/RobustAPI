After sorting, you can access the elements in their sorted order using the get() method of the List interface. The reason for this design choice is likely due to the fact that maintaining a sorted list at all times can be costly in terms of performance, especially when adding or removing elements. Therefore, it's more efficient to sort a list only when necessary."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Why is there no SortedList in Java?: :In Java there are the SortedSet and SortedMap interfaces. Both belong to the Java Collections framework and provide a sorted way to access the elements. However, in my understanding there is no SortedList in Java. You can use java.util.Collections.sort() to sort a list.Any idea why it is designed like that?\nPlease using this api: List.get.\nAnswer:"
