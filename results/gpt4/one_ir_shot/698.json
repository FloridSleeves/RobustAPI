If the file does not exist, a FileNotFoundException will be thrown. To handle this, you can use a try-catch block to catch the exception and print the stack trace. This will help you understand why the exception is being thrown."

However, when I try to initialize a new PrintWriter it throws a FileNotFound exception.Here are two versions of my code that both don't work, writer is initialized in the global variable as a PrintWriter.File file = new File(fileName);writer = new PrintWriter(fileName);writer.println(\"N: \" + N);writer.println(\"E: \" + E);writer.println(\"D: \" + D);writer.flush();writer.close();~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~writer = new PrintWriter(fileName);writer.println(\"N: \" + N);writer.println(\"E: \" + E);writer.println(\"D: \" + D);writer.flush();writer.close();Here is a list of the imports I'm using, am I possibly missing one?import java.text.DateFormat;import java.text.SimpleDateFormat;import java.math.*;import java.math.BigInteger;import java.util.*;import java.io.*;\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
