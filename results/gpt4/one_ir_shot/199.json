This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Run a command over SSH with JSch: :I'm trying to run a command over SSH with JSch, but JSch has virtually no documentation and the examples I've found are terrible. For example, this one doesn't show code for handling the output stream. And, this one uses an ugly hack to know when to stop reading from the output stream.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
