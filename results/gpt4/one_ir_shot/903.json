If there are simultaneous calls to TestServlet class, the 'message' string variable may not be safe to print without crossing from concurrent threads. To make it thread-safe, you can use the 'synchronized' keyword to the doGet method. This will ensure that only one thread can access this method at a time. The getBytes() method is used to convert the string into a sequence of bytes and then write it to the output stream."
