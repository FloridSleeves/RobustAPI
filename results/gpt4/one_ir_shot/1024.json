Here we are using the \":\" as the delimiter to split the string. The nextToken() method of StringTokenizer class is used to return the next token from the StringTokenizer object. After getting the tokens, we trim any leading or trailing whitespace using the trim() method and then set the text of the TextViews."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Android Split string: :I have  a string called CurrentString and is in the form of something like this\"Fruit: they taste good\". I would like to split up the CurrentString using the : as the delimiter.So that way the word \"Fruit\" will be split into its own string and \"they taste good\" will be another string.And then i would simply like to use SetText() of 2 different TextViews to display that string. What would be the best way to approach this? \nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
