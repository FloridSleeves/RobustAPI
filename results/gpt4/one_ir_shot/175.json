However, you can create your own class that encapsulates both an InputStream and an OutputStream. In the provided code, we create a class called InputOutputStream that contains both an InputStream and an OutputStream. We then use this class to either open a file stream and convert it to InputOutputStream or make an InputOutputStream from a string, depending on the condition."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Java: common interface to InputStream and OutputStream: :This question is related (in some way) with this one.Basically, I want to make a function, like this:public InputOutputStream func(){    if (condition)    {        // open a file stream and convert to InputOutputStream     }    else    {        // make an InputOutputStream from string    }}Several questions arise:I can't find anywhere class like InputOutputStream. It's only InputStream and OutputStream and its variations (like InputDataStream, OutputDataStream, etc). Is there one? I need a stream which supports both read and write operations.How can I make an InputOutputStream from file?How can I make an InputOutputStream from string?For C++ InputOutputStream is a std::iostream. And I can convert std::fstream or std::stringstream to it without any problems. Is it reachable in Java?Thanks.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
