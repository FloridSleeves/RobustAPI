In the given code, we are reading each line and breaking it into tokens. We are then adding these tokens as edges to the graph. The loop runs until the second last line, as we are subtracting 1 from the total number of lines. The last line is then read and stored in the 'lastLine' variable, but not processed as part of the graph."

No problem therebut then i have this for-loopfor (int i = 0; i < (amount of lines); i++) {        StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());        graph.addEdge(Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken()), Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken()));    }i cant write in the code how many times i want it to put integers, because my code should run generally with other inputs...How can i make it stop before the last line, i still need to be able to use the last bufferreaderline\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
