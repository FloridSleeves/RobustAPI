For each line, it uses a StringTokenizer to break the line into tokens (integers in this case). It then parses each token as an integer, and if the token's position (tracked by the count variable) is odd (meaning it's a second, fourth, sixth, etc. integer), it adds the integer to the sum. The sum of every second integer in each line is then printed out."
