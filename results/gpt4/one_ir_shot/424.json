The constructor takes an existing iterator as an argument. The next() method returns the next even number from the original iterator, and the hasNext() method checks if there are more even numbers. The advanceIterator() method is used to move the iterator to the next even number."

I am given an iterator for a list of integers. I need to write a function that returns takes this iterator as argument and returns the iterator for even numbers only. I was told, I cannot modify the original list of numbers. Hence, removing odd numbers from the list is not the solution. Please advise. Thanks.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
