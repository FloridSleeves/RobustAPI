After using the Cursor, you should always close it to free up resources."

This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: What is the best way to use a single instance of SQLiteOpenHelper among two different activities?: :I'm coding for the first time in Android (Java) an application using a sqlite database. Two activities must save some informations so I use in both a MySQLiteHelper to access the database.I read here that building SQLiteOpenHelper as static data member could be a good practice so I did this. The static factory method ensures that there exists only one DatabaseHelper instance at any time.I create in each activity a SQLiteOpenHelper that uses the method getWritableDatabase() but I don't know where to use the close() method. Should I put this method after every modification or once at the end of the activity ? Thank you =)\nPlease using this api: SQLiteDatabase.query.\nAnswer:"
