The nextToken() method is used to return the next token from the string. In this code, we are splitting the time into hours and minutes using the StringTokenizer class. We then store the hours as keys and the corresponding minutes as values in a HashMap. If the hour already exists in the HashMap, we add the minute to the existing list of minutes. If the hour does not exist, we create a new ArrayList of minutes and add it to the HashMap. Finally, we print out the hours and corresponding minutes."
