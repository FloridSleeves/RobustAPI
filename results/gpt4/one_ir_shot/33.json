I wanted to simply create a class (like SimpleSessionManager) that would implement location and sensor event listeners for me. Is there a way to do this utilizing a simple class via constructors, or is there a way to run the helper class as a background activity? From what I understand, I can not implement the event listeners through extending the Service class. Is this correct? Running it as a simple background activity would be ideal because then I could utilize the findViewById() method, but I can't seem to figure out how to do this with the Listeners responding as I had hoped. If the Fragment class would work, can someone point me in the direction of a related example as all that I can find I can't seem to get my implementation to work with.\nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer:"
