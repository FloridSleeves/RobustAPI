The nextToken() method of StringTokenizer class is used to return the next token from the StringTokenizer object. In the given code, we are skipping the first and third tokens by simply calling nextToken() without storing the result. The second and fourth tokens are stored in the variables secondToken and fourthToken respectively."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Tokenizing a String with tab delimiter in Java while skipping some tokens: :I have a huge file with data (~8Gb / ~80 Million records). Every record has 6-8 attributes which are split by a single tab. I would like for starters to copy some given attributes in another file. So I would like a more elegant code than the above, for example if I want only the second and the last token from a total of 4:StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(line, \"\\t\");st.nextToken(); //get rid of the first tokenSystem.out.println(st.nextToken()); //show me the second tokenst.nextToken(); //get rid of the third tokenSystem.out.println(st.nextToken()); //show me the fourth tokenI'm reminding that it's a huge file so I have to avoid any redundant if checks.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
