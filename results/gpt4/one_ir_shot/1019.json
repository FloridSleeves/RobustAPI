For each line, a StringTokenizer is created to tokenize the line based on the default delimiter (which is space). The while loop inside iterates through each token (number) in the line and assigns 1 to the corresponding position in the 2D array. After all tokens in a line are processed, the variable 'w' is incremented by 1. This process continues until all lines in the file are read."
