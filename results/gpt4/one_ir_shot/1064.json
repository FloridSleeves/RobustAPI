In this case, we are using it to break each line of the file into tokens separated by commas. The nextToken() method is used to get the next token from the StringTokenizer object. If the token is \"Average\" or \"Joe\", it is appended to the StringBuilder object. Finally, the contents of the StringBuilder object are printed to the console."

I'm new to java reading from files, and I don't know how to work with just some parts of what I readHere is the initial file: http://pastebin.com/D0paWtAdAnd I have to write in another file the following output:Average,Joe,44,31,18,12,9,10I've managed just to take everything from the file and print it to output. I would need help just in taking the output I need and print it to the screen. Any help is appreciated.This is what I wrote up to now:public class FileParsing {public static Stringread(String filename) throws IOException {BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"C:\\\\Users\\\\Bogdi\\\\Desktop\\\\example.txt\"));String s;StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();while((s = in.readLine())!= null)   sb.append(s + \"\\n\");in.close();return sb.toString();}\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
