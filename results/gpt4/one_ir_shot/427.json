It uses two nested loops to iterate over the list. The outer loop starts from the first element and the inner loop starts from the next element of the outer loop's current element. This way, for each pair of elements (a, b), only one pair is added to the set, either (a, b) or (b, a), but not both. The Pair class should implement hashCode() and equals() methods to ensure uniqueness of the pairs."

For our purposes, the set of (a,b) is equivalent to (b,a), and thus only one should appear in the resulting set.I can see how one might construct such a set using a Pair class that implements hashCode and equals() based on the paired elements, but I'm wondering if there isn't already a more standard way to generate such a set.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
