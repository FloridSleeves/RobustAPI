The properties are returned as a map where the keys are the property names and the values are the property values. Then it uses an iterator to go through all entries in the map and print out the key-value pairs. The Iterator.next method is used to get the next entry in the map."

I need to get it for a Java application.Example:node FR contains: \"Salut_01\" : \"Bonjour\"node UK contains: \"Salut_01\" : \"Hello\"etc...\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
