When a client connects, we accept the connection and get an InputStream from the Socket. We then read data from the InputStream. On the client side, we create a Socket that connects to the server and get an OutputStream from the Socket. We then write data to the OutputStream. The server will receive this data through its InputStream."

The server is connected to a database.Ok, sorry for that, it's a classic question I'm sure, but I don't know how to start.In a project I worked for they implemented a lot of magic with Proxy.newProxyInstance() to invoke the Glassfish server transparently.I don't want to use a Glassfish server. I just want something simple in plain Java. But the concept of proxies seems pretty cool.Do you have ideas or examples of such thing? How do I write the server part to handle the requests of clients?Thanks in advanceFluminis\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
