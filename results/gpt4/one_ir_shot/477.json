Then, we create an ImageResizer object, which is a hypothetical class that implements Iterable<Image> and resizes the image in a memory-efficient way. We then get an Iterator from the ImageResizer and use it to process each resized image. The Iterator.next() method is used to get the next image in the sequence. This approach allows us to process each resized image one at a time, which can significantly reduce memory usage compared to loading all resized images into memory at once."
