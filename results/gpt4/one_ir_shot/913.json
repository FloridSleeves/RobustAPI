The compressed data can then be sent to the client.\n\nOn the client side in JavaScript, you can use the Zlib library to decompress the received data. The decompress() method returns a byte array, which can then be parsed back into a JSON object using JSON.parse()."

Improve this question                    I have a large amount of data being sent from server to Javascript, which is taking quite a long time to load.I was wondering how I can implement compression at server and decompression in Javascript. I would appreciate any help.\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:"
