An attempt is made to read as many as len bytes, but a smaller number may be read. The number of bytes actually read is returned as an integer. This method blocks until input data is available, end of file is detected, or an exception is thrown. The ByteArrayInputStream creates a new ByteArrayInputStream. The buffer array is not copied. The initial value of pos is offset and the initial value of count is the minimum of offset+length and buf.length. The buffer array is not protected against concurrent access from multiple threads."
