It reads the file incrementally, so it doesn't need to load the entire file into memory. When it encounters a text node (XMLStreamConstants.CHARACTERS), it decodes the base64 string into a byte array. Then it writes the decoded bytes to the output file one at a time. This way, it never needs to hold the entire decoded file in memory at once."

Problem: the file could easily reach the size of 100 MB. Every solution I tried ended with the \"java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space\". The problem is not reading the xml in general or the decoding process, but the size of the base64 block.I used jdom, dom4j and XMLStreamReader to access the xml file. However, as soon as I want to access the base64 content of the respective element I get the mentioned error. I also tried an xslt using saxon's base64Binary-to-octets function, but of course with the same result.Is there a way to stream this base64 encoded part into a file without getting the whole chunk in one single piece?Thanks for your hints,Andreas\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
