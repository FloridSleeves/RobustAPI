The findViewById() method is used to find a view in the current view hierarchy, and it returns null if no view with the specified ID is found. In this case, the DatePicker view is not in the view hierarchy when the setupDatePicker() method is called, so findViewById() returns null, and a NullPointerException is thrown when you try to call a method on the null object. To fix this, you should call setContentView() before calling setupDatePicker(). Also, you should pass the Activity context to the AlarmHelper class, so it can use the findViewById() method to find the DatePicker view in the correct view hierarchy."

I believe it has something to do the the Context but I haven't got a clue how to implement it within my helper class.Any help would be greatly appreciated.\nPlease using this api: Activity.findViewById.\nAnswer:"
