This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Returning the nth Token: :I'm very new at Java and I have a question about a summer assignment. These are the instructions:Write a class called SpecialToken that has a static method called thirdToken. Thismethod should return as a String, the third token of a String that you pass as a parameter. You may assume that spaces will serve as delimiters.This is what I have so far but honestly I am stumped at what the parameter should be and how to return the third token! I was thinking I could do something like nextToken() until the third.public class SpecialToken {    public static String thirdToken() {    }}\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
