It uses an array of counters to keep track of the current index for each array in the list. The outer loop continues until all combinations have been generated. The inner loop constructs the current combination by appending the current element from each array to a StringBuilder. After printing the current combination, the counters are updated for the next iteration. If a counter reaches the end of its corresponding array, it is reset to 0 and the counter for the previous array is incremented. The process continues until all counters have been reset to 0, indicating that all combinations have been generated."

How would a loop version of this look?Is there a better way to solve this problem?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
