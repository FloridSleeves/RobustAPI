I retrieve/read an image from a URL, where the URL does not have a file extension. Then I wish to write/save the image to the local storage, but I have to specify the image file extension (i.e. JPG, PNG, etc.), which I cannot retrieve its extension through the BufferedImage.Could one please point out how it can be done?Any other method will do.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
