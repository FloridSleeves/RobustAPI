This method uses an Iterator to traverse the activities list. It adds the first 'limit' number of activities to a new list and returns it. This way, you can fetch a limited number of recent activities. However, this does not limit the size of the activities list stored in the database. It only limits the number of activities fetched from the list."

Is it possible to automatically do it during any fetch from DB? (so that I don't have to limit the collection by hand in Java).@Entitypublic class Person {    @Id    @GeneratedValue    private Long id;    @OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL, fetch = FetchType.EAGER)    @OrderBy(\"timestamp DESC\")    @JoinColumn(name = \"PERSON_ID\")    private List<Activity> activities;    // other setters, getters, etc. }Essentially I'd like to keep, say, 20 entries in the ACTIVITY entries (dropping the oldest rows, when newer are inserted), but fetch only 5 latest. Is this possible?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
