It then gets the last modification time of the file in milliseconds since the epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT) using the lastModified() method. This time is then converted to a Date object and written to an output file using PrintWriter. The PrintWriter.write() method writes the string representation of the Date object to the output file."
