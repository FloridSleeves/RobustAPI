You can get the current table model from the JTable using the getModel() method, then add rows to it using the addRow() method. The addRow() method takes a Vector object as an argument, which represents the row to be added. The Map.get() method is used to retrieve each Vector object from the map using its key."

No, it did not help me. Yes, I am a dolt. Please don't answer with a reference to that document. What I am specifically interested in is how to dynamically add rows and columns to my Jtable via the Netbeans IDE. I already have an object that contains a hashmap with my data. I can't figure out where or what object I should be passing that object to. Thanks for your time! I have a vector that contains a series (of length l) of objects (each one corresponding to a row). How do I get that vector object to display on the JTable?\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:"
