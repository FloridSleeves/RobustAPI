This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: create file in cache: :My requirement is such, I don't have a target file located physically on my drive to write outputstream in it. So, is it possible to create a file in the cache itself?  Using Java.\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:"
