In this case, we are splitting the id from the text field into two parts: the string part and the integer part. We then use these two parts to create a SQL query that selects rows from the database where the string column matches the string part and the integer column matches the integer part. The PreparedStatement allows us to execute this query. If a row is found that matches the criteria, the other fields are filled based on the result set."
