In this case, we are using UTF-8 encoding. The OutputStreamWriter is a bridge from character streams to byte streams: Characters written to it are encoded into bytes using a specified charset. The charset that it uses may be specified by name or may be given explicitly, or the platform's default charset may be accepted. The FileOutputStream is an output stream for writing data to a File or to a FileDescriptor."
