It returns NULL when the map contains no such mapping for the key. In the given code, we first check if the map contains the key. If it does, we get the value, which is an ArrayList, and add the new value to it. If the map does not contain the key, we create a new ArrayList, add the value to it, and put it in the map with the given key."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Appending data to a subarray instead of having it overwritten with the latest entry: :I currently have a Map that is configured as such.Map<String, ArrayList<Object>> map = new HashMap<String, ArrayList<Object>>();where the purpose is to be able to have a setup much like the following:array(\"foo\"->array(1->\"aaa\",2->\"bbb\",3->\"ccc\"),      \"bar\"->array(1->\"aaa\",2->\"bbb\",3->\"ccc\"),      \"bah\"->array(1->\"aaa\",2->\"bbb\",3->\"ccc\"),)The problem I'm running into is that I can create the root array fine, but it will do the following, using the previous example as illustrationarray(\"foo\"->array(3->\"ccc\"),      \"bar\"->array(2->\"bbb\"),      \"bah\"->array(3->\"ccc\"),)What I'm trying to find out is how I can append the sub array as opposed to having it overwritten. I assume it's easily done I'm just missing something obvious.\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:"
