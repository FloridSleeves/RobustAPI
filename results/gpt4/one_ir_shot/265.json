In this case, we are using it to iterate over the collection 'c'. We initialize 'min' with the first element of the collection, then we iterate over the rest of the elements. If the current element is smaller than 'min' (as determined by the comparator 'comp'), we update 'min'. Finally, we return the smallest element. This avoids the need for an unchecked cast, which was causing the warning in the original code."

From what I understand this results from not specifying the type of objects in my collection. I'm currently working with int's for testing purposes, but the program is supposed to allow for sorting of any type object. I don't think I want to specify my collections as int's, and my collection is currently of type T for this reason. But my instructions explicitly state that my program should not generate any warnings. Here is one of my methods:What I have now:     else {        T[] a = new T[c.size()];        c.toArray(T[] a);        T min = a[0];        for (int i = 0; i < a.size(); i++) {           if (comp.compare(min, a[i]) > 0) {              min = a[i];           }        }        return min;      }What I'm getting:    Testing.java:48: error: generic array creation            T[] a = c.toArray(new T[c.size()]);\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
