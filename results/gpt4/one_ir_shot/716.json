This way, the FileWriter instance will handle the file opening and closing, and the PrintWriter will handle the writing. The FileWriter constructor takes two arguments: the file path and a boolean indicating whether to append to the file. If the boolean is true, the data will be written to the end of the file rather than the beginning. The write() method of PrintWriter is used to write a string to the file. The \"\\n\" at the end of the string is a newline character, which will start a new line in the file after the string."

I know its probably a easy fix... I'm learning.. Thank you!\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
