It provides constant time performance for basic operations like add, remove and contains, assuming the hash function disperses the elements properly among the buckets. The Iterator.next() method returns the next element in the iteration. The Iterator.remove() method removes the last element returned by this iterator from the underlying collection. This method can be called only once per call to next()."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Collection for fast add, get and remove random element: :Not a big question really. What collection would be good for fast add, get and removal of a random element?The items don't have to retain any kind of order.I'm developing a snake game and I'm keeping track of unoccupied cells in the game area (to be able to quickly pick a new place for the apple once it's eaten).Here \"fast\" can be O(log n) or O(1).\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
