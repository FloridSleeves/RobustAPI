An attempt is made to read as many as len bytes, but a smaller number may be read. The number of bytes actually read is returned as an integer. This method blocks until input data is available, end of file is detected, or an exception is thrown. If len is zero, then no bytes are read and 0 is returned; otherwise, there is an attempt to read at least one byte. If no byte is available because the stream is at end of file, the value -1 is returned; otherwise, at least one byte is read and stored into b."

The size of the binary content is determined by some one of the plain text lines I read.I was using a BufferedReader to read the individual lines, however it exposes no methods to refer to read a byte array. The readUTF for a DataInputStream doesnt read all the way to the end of the line, and the readLine method is deprecated.Using the underlying FileInputStream to read returns empty byte arrays. Any suggestions on how to go about this?private DOTDataInfo parseFile(InputStream stream) throws IOException{DOTDataInfo info = new DOTDataInfo();BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(stream));int binSize = 0;String line;while((line = reader.readLine()) != null){    if(line.length() == 0)        break;    DOTProperty prop = parseProperty(line);    info.getProperties().add(prop);    if(prop.getName().equals(\"ContentSize\"))        binSize = Integer.parseInt(prop.getValue());}byte[] content = new byte[binSize];stream.read(content); //Its all empty now. If I use a DataInputStream instead, its got the values from the filereturn info;}\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
