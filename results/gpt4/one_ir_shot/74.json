The PrintWriter.println() method writes a string followed by a newline to the output stream. The flush() method is called after each write operation to ensure that the data is actually sent, rather than being buffered. This allows you to switch between different types of output streams on the same socket without having to close and reopen the socket. However, you need to be careful to ensure that the receiving side is expecting the correct type of data at each point."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Can I change the type of stream I'm using without closing and reopening the socket in Java?: :I'm doing some socket programming in Java and I'd like to be able to change between using the ObjectOutputStream, the DataOutputStream, and the PrintWriter all within the same socket/connection.  Is this possible and what is the best way to do it?I've tried just creating both types of objects, for example ObjectOutputStream and DataOutputStream, but that doesn't seem to work.The reason I want to switch between them is to, for example, send a text command \"INFO\" that signals I'm about to send an object with information or a command \"DATA\" signalling that I'm about to send data.  Any advice on the best way to do this is appreciated.\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:"
