However, when I try to write it to a file, the file is empty.PrintWriter writer = null;writer = new PrintWriter(\"grep__output\", \"UTF-8\");writer.println(s);writer.close();Also, I tried to directly writing to file in the above while (previously creating the file), but it's the same.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
