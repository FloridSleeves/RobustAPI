It then writes this buffer to a file using a FileChannel. This reduces the amount of data written to the file, and therefore increases IO performance. The ByteBuffer.flip() method is called to prepare the buffer for writing, by setting its limit to the current position and its position to zero."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Write \"compressed\" Array to increase IO performance?: :I have an int and float array each of length 220 million (fixed). Now, I want to store/upload those arrays to/from memory and disk. Currently, I am using Java NIO's FileChannel and MappedByteBuffer to solve this. It works fine, but it takes near about 5 seconds (Wall Clock Time) for storing/uploading array to/from memory to disk. Now, I want to make it faster. Here, I should mention most of those array elements are 0 ( nearly 52 %).like:int arr1 [] = { 0 , 0 , 6 , 7 , 1, 0 , 0 ...}Can anybody help me, is there any nice way to improve speed by not storing or loading those 0's. This can compensated by using Arrays.fill (array , 0).\nPlease using this api: FileChannel.write.\nAnswer:"
