It extends the Iterable interface, so you can use it in a foreach loop or explicitly create an Iterator from it. The next() method of Iterator is used to get the next SocialNetworkService in the Instance. Then, you can call the transmitMessage method on the service to transmit the message. This way, you can pass the message to all implementations of SocialNetworkService."

I.e if i dont support dont transmit...c). i could have annotaded injection i.e@Twitter, @Facebook all in a controller bean and then select the appropriate but my service implementations number will grow....Thanks in advance,Dimitri\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
