The next() method of the Iterator is used to get the first ImageWriter. Then it sets the compression parameters and writes the compressed image to a new file. The quality of the compression can be adjusted with the setCompressionQuality() method. The lower the value, the higher the compression."

Improve this question                    From our application we fetch images (jpeg/png) from a third party service, after download we want to save these images as compressed.Can any one please guide how to compress images in Java ?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
