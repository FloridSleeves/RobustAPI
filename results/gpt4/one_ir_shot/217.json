In this case, it is used to read the output of the REG command. The redirectErrorStream(true) method call is used to redirect the error stream to the same location as the standard output stream. This way, you can read both the output and any errors that might occur from the same InputStream. The waitFor() method is used to cause the current thread to wait, if necessary, until the process represented by this Process object has terminated."

This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Windows REG command not working when executed from ProcessBuilder in Java: :I'm trying to use Java to create a start up registry key and I'm getting a really weird result. On some OS's such as XP the command works flawlessly. However, on Windows 7 it only creates the key if you run the compiled jar or classes, and not from an applet on a web page. Additionally on Windows 8, the command does not work at all. I've tried debugging this, and it seems that the REG command is executing successfully. If I run the command manually from command prompt, it creates the keys, with the same output as when it's ran from inside the program. Heres an example of the code:public static int regadd(String key, String name, String val) throws IOException, InterruptedException {    ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder(new String[]{\"REG\", \"ADD\", key, \"/v\", name, \"/d\", val, \"/f\"});    pb.redirectOutput(new File(PathManager.getDirectory(), \"log0.txt\"));    int i = pb.start().waitFor();    Logger.log(\"ADD: \" + i);    return i;}In log0.txt it prints this:The operation completed successfully.Additionally, the \"result\" of the program prints ADD: 0So at this point, I am at a loss of what could be the problem. I am aware of the other dicey ways to add to the registry, but I would like to keep my code compatible with all VM distributions. Is there a way to accomplish this or fix the exiting method?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
