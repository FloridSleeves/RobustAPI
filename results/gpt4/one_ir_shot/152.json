InputStream.read() is thread-safe, meaning it can be used by multiple threads at the same time without causing race conditions. Therefore, multiple threads can invoke FileUtils.contentEquals() in parallel without any issues. Each thread will get the correct result for its own comparison. However, the order in which the threads complete may not be predictable."
