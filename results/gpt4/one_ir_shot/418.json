In your code, you are using it to iterate through the elements of your data array. To remove the minimum element, you first find the minimum element as you did before. Then, you create a new iterator and iterate through the elements again. When you find the minimum element, you call the Iterator.remove() method, which removes the last element returned by the iterator. This will remove the minimum element from your data array. As for your first question, when comparing strings, Java uses lexicographical order, which is similar to alphabetical order but also includes other characters."

I am able to find the minimum item, but I am having trouble removing it.  My code is below.  public Comparable removeMin() {    Iterator<T> it = iterator();    T min = it.next();    while (it.hasNext()) {        T next = it.next();        if (min.compareTo(next) > 0)            min = next;        it.remove();    }    System.out.println(min);    return min;}I have the print statement there just to verify that it is in fact getting the minimum item.  The code in main looks like this.public static void main(String[] args) {  Bag<String> sbag = new Bag<String>();    sbag.add(\"Noriko\");    sbag.add(\"Peter\");     sbag.add(\"Buddy\");    sbag.add(\"Mary\");    sbag.removeMin();  }When I run the sbag.removeMin(); command, the console prints \"Buddy\" which tells me that it is choosing \"Buddy\" as the min item.  However, if I instead populate sbag with integers, it always prints the smallest integer, which indicates to me I have my code correct in that regard.I have two questions.1). When passing a list of strings such as above, how does Java determine which is smallest?2). How can I fix my code so that it not only finds the minimum item, but also removes it?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
