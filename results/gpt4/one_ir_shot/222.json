I am able to know the location of the start of the GZIP section using magic number and the GZIPInputStream in Java. However, I need to know the compressed size of the gzip section. GZIPInputStream would return me the uncompressed file size.Is there anybody who has an idea? \nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
