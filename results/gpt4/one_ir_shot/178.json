This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Runtime.exec doesn't compile java file: :I compile java file by Runtime.exec(\"javac MyFrog.java\");It says no errors, doesn't output anything, but doesn't create MyFrog.class file.if i write Runtime.exec(\"javac\") it outputs to output some help text.So I understand that program is working, but don't create class file. Permissions are ok.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
