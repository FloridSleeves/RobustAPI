The Iterator.next() method is used to get the next ImageReader in the iterator. The canReadRaster() method checks if the reader can handle raster-based images. If it can, it reads the image as a raster and then creates a new BufferedImage from the raster. This way, the number of bands in the raster and the number of components in the color space will match."

NOTE : At first i tried using ImageIcon to add to JPanel but it could not work hence i found this solution which lead to my current problem. I just starting programming in Java.EDIT: Here are the link to the images and I am doing a Java ApplicationI need an alternative to add a image to a JPanel. \nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
