This means that each time you get new GPS data, you open the file, write the data, and then close the file. This will overwrite the file each time, so you only ever see the last piece of GPS data that was written. To fix this, you should open the file before the while loop and close it after the while loop. Also, you should use the write() method instead of println() to write the string to the file. The write() method does not append a newline at the end of the string, unlike println()."
