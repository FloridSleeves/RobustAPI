In this case, we're using it to iterate through a collection of numbers. We initialize the minimum value to the first element in the collection, then iterate through the rest of the collection. If we find a number that is smaller than our current minimum, we update the minimum. This way, by the end of the iteration, we have found the smallest number in the collection. The reason for using Collection<? extends T> instead of Collection<T> is to allow for greater flexibility in the types of collections that can be passed to the method. This is known as covariance."

What's the added benefit?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
