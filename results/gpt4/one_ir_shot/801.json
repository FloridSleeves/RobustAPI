Then it reads the second file line by line and checks if the line is in the HashSet. If it is not, it writes the line to the output file. This approach is much faster because it only needs to read each file once and checking if a HashSet contains a value is very fast."

That is about three months!Is there any ideas to make it done in a much much more less time.Thanks in advance.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
