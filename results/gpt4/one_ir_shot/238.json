This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: DataInputStream and readLine() with UTF8: :I've got some trouble with sending a UTF8 string from a c socket to a java socket. The following method works fine:BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream(), \"UTF8\"));main.title = in.readLine();but then I need a int java.io.InputStream.read(byte[] b, int offset, int length) method which does not exist for a BufferedReader. So then I tried to take a DataInputStream DataInputStream in2 = new DataInputStream(socket.getInputStream());but everything it reads is just rubbish. Then I tried to use the readLine() method from DataInputStream but this doesn't give me the correct UTF8 string.You see my dilemma. Can't I use two readers for one InputStream? Or can I convert the DataInputStream.readLine() result and convert it to UTF8?Thanks,Martin\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
