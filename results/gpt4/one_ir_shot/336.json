In this case, we are using a for loop to iterate over half of the elements in the 'tiles' list. The loop counter 'i' is incremented until it reaches half the size of the 'tiles' list, at which point the loop terminates."

I'm using them to make every class of my objects to do \"drawing\", but it takes a lot of memory so I want to cut it in half, is there a way to do for each loop not for a full list?for(Tile tile: tiles){tile.draw();}I want to:for(Tile tile: (half of)tiles){    tile.draw();}is it possible or I just need to get lenght of tiles and when it reaches the number break the loop?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
