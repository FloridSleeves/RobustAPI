It uses the first function in the list to group the data at the current level. If there are more functions in the list, it calls itself recursively with the rest of the list to group the data at the next level. If there are no more functions in the list, it simply groups the data at the current level and returns the result. The result is a nested map where each level corresponds to a function in the list."

A person have some attributes like name, country, town, zipcode, etc. I wrote the static code, which works very well:Object groupedData = data.stream().collect(groupingBy(Person::getName, Collectors.groupingBy(Person::getCountry, Collectors.groupingBy(Person::getTown))));But the problem is, that is it not dynamic. Sometimes I want to just group by name and town, sometimes by a attributes. How can I do this? Non Java 8 solutions are welcome as well.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
