In this case, we first create an Iterator for the LinkedList of Items. Then, we check if there is a next item in the list using the hasNext() method. If there is, we use the next() method to get the next Item and assign it to the currentItem. Now, you can refer to the currentItem in other parts of your program."

How to refer to the current item?: :I have a class which holds a linked list of Item objects. I want this class to hold the \"current\" Item somehow so I can refer to it in other parts of the program. Is the best way to do this to create a Item object within my class and set it equal to the \"current\" Item when I wish to set it?as such:for(int i = 0; i < [LinkedListofItems].length(); i++)    {Item currentItem = [LinkedListofItems].getAt(i); break;}And then if I would like to set and Items attributes equal to anothers I would override the = operator?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
