If it finds a line that contains \"usrnm:\" followed by the username, it reads the next line. If the next line contains \"pswrd:\" followed by the password, it prints \"Login successful\" and returns. If it doesn't find a match, it prints \"Login failed\". The PrintWriter.write API is not used in this code as it is used for writing to files, not reading from them."
