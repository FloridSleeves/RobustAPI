An Iterator is created from this Iterable. The pickWidget() method then uses the Iterator's next() method to get the next Widget in the cycle. The Iterator maintains its position in the cycle across calls to pickWidget(), so it will cycle through the Widgets in the order they are in the list, and start over when it reaches the end."

Apache's CircularFifoQueue seems close but no cigar, as I don't want anything popped off the queue, I just want it to cycle over the same list time and time again as it is called.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
