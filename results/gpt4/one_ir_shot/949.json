This means it must be called on an instance of the class (in this case, the string \"coding\"), not the class itself. Therefore, the correct usage is word.getBytes(), not String.getBytes(word)."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Why I can't use this program in a second way: :String word = \"coding\";/*first way*/byte[] code = word.getBytes();/*second way*/byte[] code2 = String.getBytes(word);Could someone explain me why I can't declare my byte array with the second way.What is the difference between two of them?\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:"
