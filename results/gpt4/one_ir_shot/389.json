However, you can use the Iterator interface to traverse through the queue, find the element you want to update, remove it using the remove() method of Iterator, and then add the updated element back to the queue. This will ensure that the queue maintains its heap property. Note that the PriorityQueue class in Java is a min-heap by default. If you want a max-heap, you need to initialize the PriorityQueue with Collections.reverseOrder()."

This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Reheapify java.util.PriorityQueue after updating elements: :I have a PriorityQueue containing references to some objects. When I initially insert the elements into the priority queue the ordering is maintained by the data structure. Now after a remove operation I update some of the references which are being held by the priority queue. Ideally this requires a reheapify operation on the priority queue but as is obvious since I am modifying selected references externally a reheapify cannot be triggered. So what is the best way to ensure that I am able to get the advantage of a heap like fast extract max in the presence of modifications to arbitrary elements inside the queue? I see I need a better data structure?To be more specific I need an implementation of something like a Fibonacci heap in Java.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithmIs that available?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
