This means that you can call instance methods on System.in, such as read(). The read() method of InputStream is used to read the next byte of data from the input stream. It returns an int that represents the next byte of data, or -1 if the end of the file is reached."

Declared as: public static final InputStream in Which means that in is an InputStream varibale. However I see some example, using System.in.read() to read input.  How can it do that, the read() method in InputStream is not a static method, how can it be directlly call it? As my understanding, only static method can call directly by a Class without creating an instance.read() declartion: public abstract int read() throws IOExceptionThank you Jon Skeet for answering, I still have some point don't understand.If I call System.in.read() which mean that I call InputStream class method read() ?java.lang.System.in -----> java.io.InputStream ----> read()calling java.lang.System.in ( which is a static variable), in is a java.io.InputStream variableThe calling act like calling PrintStream class.The process work like calling : PrintStream.read()however I have difficulty on understand the read() method, which is not a static method, as it\u2019s should not be call directly.It should be call like: PrintStream rd = new PrintStream();int c = rd.read();as read() should be call by an instance.read() declartion: public abstract int read() throws IOExceptionPS: I try this code does not work:InputStream rd = new InputStream();        int c = rd.read();        System.out.println(c);But do not know why.ref: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/InputStream.html\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
