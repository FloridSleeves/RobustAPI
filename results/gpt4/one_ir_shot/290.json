In your code, you are using it to get the next string from your ArrayList. The problem in your original code was that you were not looping through your ArrayList, so the switch statement was only being executed once. By adding a while loop that continues as long as there are more elements in the ArrayList, you can ensure that each string is processed. Also, you should use generics to specify that your Iterator and token are of type String, which avoids a potential ClassCastException when calling the equals method."

Object token is supposed to be read as 'Table'.        void process() {        Iterator fileIterator = fileContent.iterator();        int state = 0;        Object token = null;        switch (state) {        case 0:            token = fileIterator.next();            if (token.equals(\"Table\")) {                System.out.println(token);                state = 1;            } else {                System.err.println(\"Corrupt file format at state 0: \"+ token);                System.exit(0);            }            break;        }    }This doesn't switch state to 1, instead it prints out:'Corrupt file format at state 0: Table'So it seems as it reads the Object token correctly as 'Table' but not for the statement 'if (token.equals(\"Table\"))'. I have also tried 'if (token == (\"Table\"))'Can somebody help me?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
