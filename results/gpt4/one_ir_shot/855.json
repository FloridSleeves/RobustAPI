You can use the read(byte[] b) method to read up to b.length bytes of data from this file into an array of bytes. This method blocks until at least one byte of input is available. The readByte() method reads a signed eight-bit value from this file. It blocks until the byte is actually read, the end of the stream is detected, or an exception is thrown."

This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Resource file format processing in Java: :I am trying to implement a processor for a specific resource archive file format in Java. The format has a Header comprised of a three-char description, a dummy byte, plus a byte indicating the number of files. Then each file has an entry consisting of a dummy byte, a twelve-char string describing the file name, a dummy byte, and an offset declared in a three-byte array. What would be the proper class for reading this kind of structure? I have tried RandomAccessFile but it does not allow to read arrays of data, e.g. I can only read three chars by calling readChar() three times, etc.Of course I can extend RandomAccessFile to do what I want but there's got to be a proper out-of-the-box class to do this kind of processing isn't it?This is my reader for the header in C#:protected override void ReadHeader(){    Header = new string(this.BinaryReader.ReadChars(3));    byte dummy = this.BinaryReader.ReadByte();    NFiles = this.BinaryReader.ReadByte();}\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:"
