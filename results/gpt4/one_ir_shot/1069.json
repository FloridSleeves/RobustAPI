It is more efficient than String.split() method when you have a simple delimiter. The nextToken() method of StringTokenizer class is used to return the next token from the StringTokenizer object. In the given code, we are creating a StringTokenizer object with the given string and delimiter. Then we are using a while loop to iterate through all the tokens and adding them to an ArrayList."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Java split String performances: :Here is the current code in my application:String[] ids = str.split(\"/\");When profiling the application, a non-negligeable time is spent string splitting. Also, the split method takes a regular expression, which is superfluous here.What alternative can I use in order to optimize the string splitting? Is StringUtils.split faster?(I would've tried and tested myself but profiling my application takes a lot of time.)\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
