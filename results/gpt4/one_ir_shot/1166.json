To avoid this, you should always check if there are more tokens available before trying to fetch one using the hasMoreTokens() method. In your code, you are reading a new line and creating a new StringTokenizer object only when id does not equal args[0]. This means that if id equals args[0] at the end of a line, you will try to fetch a token from the StringTokenizer object in the next iteration of the while loop, even though there are no more tokens available. To fix this, you should create a new StringTokenizer object for each line, and check if there are more tokens available before trying to fetch one."

But every time I run the code I get no such element exception, i don't understand why?try {        FileReader fr = new FileReader(file);        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);        String line = br.readLine();        String id = new String();        StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(line, \",\");        while(line != null){            while(!id.equals(args[0])){                line = br.readLine();                id = st.nextToken();            }        }    } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {        System.out.println(\"file not found\");    } catch (IOException e) {        System.out.println(\"not a string\");    }The file looks something like this:line1: 118, s, m, pline2: 111, s, m, c\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
