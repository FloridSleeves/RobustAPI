For each line, it uses a StringTokenizer to split the line into tokens (words) based on spaces. It then writes each token followed by a space to a new file. After all tokens from a line have been written, it writes the specific string you want to add at the end of the line. This process is repeated for all lines in the file. The result is a new file where each line is the same as the original file, but with an additional string at the end."

I don't want to delete the content, but simply add some string at the end of the line. Could you please show me a simple code for doing it? Ex, given data.txt file: aaa bbb ccceee fff gggResult after running the java program:aaa bbb ccc dddeee fff ggg hhhAdditional question : is there a simple way to \"insert\" in the line line of a given file some String? If yes, how to do it too?Result:aaa 111 bbb ccceee fff 222 gggThank you in advance for your help.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
