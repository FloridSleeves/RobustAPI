The write() method of PrintWriter class is used to write a string to the stream. If automatic flushing is enabled, the flush method will be invoked. After writing the desired strings, the close() method is used to close the PrintWriter. If you don't close the PrintWriter, the output may not be written to the file."

I cannot get know how to save the results in output file that second array is save in a lower line.This is how it saves:dist[0 10 13 10 6 18 ] pred[-15 2 5 1 4 ] I want it to save like this:dist[0 10 13 10 6 18 ]pred[-15 2 5 1 4 ]CODE:try{outputFile = new File(\"Out0304.txt\");out = new FileWriter(outputFile);out.write(\"\\n\" + \"dist[\");out.write(\"\\n\");for (Top way : tops){    out.write(way.shortest_path + \" \");}out.write(\"]\\n\");out.write(\"\\n\");out.write(\"\\n\" + \"pred[\");for (Top ww : tops){    if (ww.previous != null) {        out.write(ww.previous.number + \" \");    }            else{        out.write(\"-1\");    }}out.write(\"] \\n \");out.close();}  catch (IOException e){System.out.println(\"Blad: \" + e.toString());}}}\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
