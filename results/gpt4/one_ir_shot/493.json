If it does, the next() method is used to retrieve the next element. If there are no more elements, null is returned. This avoids the NoSuchElementException that is thrown by the find method when no element is found."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: instead of throwing exception, get null: :I'm using google-collections and trying to find the first element that satisfies Predicate if not, return me 'null'.Unfortunately, Iterables.find and Iterators.find throws NoSuchElementException when no element is found.Now, I am forced to doObject found = null;if ( Iterators.any( newIterator(...) , my_predicate ){    found = Iterators.find( newIterator(...), my_predicate )}I can surround by 'try/catch' and do the same thing but for my use-cases, I am going to encounter many cases where no-element is found. Is there a simpler way of doing this? \nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
