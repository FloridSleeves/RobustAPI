Each ProcessBuilder instance manages a collection of process attributes. The start() method creates a new Process instance with those attributes. The ProcessBuilder.start() method is a convenience method that sets the command, starts a new process, and returns the Process instance representing the running process. The InputStream.read() method is used to read the output of the executed command."
