First, create a File object for the file you want to write to. If the file doesn't exist, create it using the createNewFile() method. Then, create a PrintWriter object for the file and use the write() method to write each string from the array to the file, followed by a line separator. Close the PrintWriter when you're done to free up system resources.\n\nTo read from a file, you can use the Scanner class. Create a Scanner object for the file and use the hasNextLine() and nextLine() methods to read each line from the file and add it to a list. Finally, convert the list back to an array using the toArray() method."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Working with files in java: :I have an array of strings.I want to save those strings in a file.The problem is, I need to make a new file called db.txt (only if it doesn't exist),then somehow write strings to it.And then later I want to be able to read strings from that file and insert them to the array.Inserting and using array is not the question, but the question is how do I mess with the files? How do I create a new text file (if not existing already), how do I write to it and how do I read from it? Tried to learn it by myself but I've seen so many ways on the Internet and got confused.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
