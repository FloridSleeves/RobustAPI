After writing the string, it is necessary to close the PrintWriter using the close() method. This will flush the output stream and close the underlying file. If you don't close the PrintWriter, the written data may not be fully sent to the file. In your code, you were using the FileWriter's write method instead of the PrintWriter's write method for the first string, which is why it was not appearing in the file."
