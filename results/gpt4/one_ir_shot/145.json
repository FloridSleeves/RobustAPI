The flip() method switches a Buffer from write mode to read mode. After reading data into the buffer, you need to call flip() before you can read the data out of the buffer. Also, you should close the channels after you are done with them to free up system resources."

I tried reading a file using fileinputstream and file channel. I could not find out the bug in the following code. It runs successfully but file has not been transferred.
