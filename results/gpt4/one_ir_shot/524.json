If it is, we create an Iterator for the set 'b', call next() to get the first element, and then remove it. After that, we add the new element 'b' to the set. This way, we ensure that the set 'b' never contains more than N elements."

Thanks in advance.EDITMy goal is not to have more than N number of entries in that table at any point of time. One solution I have is to use a Set and schedule a job to remove the older entries. But I find it dirty. I am looking for a cleaner solution.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
