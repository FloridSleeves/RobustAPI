This byte array can then be sent to the server using a POST request. The HttpURLConnection class is used to create a connection to the server, and the setDoOutput(true) method is called to allow output to be sent to the server. The request method is set to POST, and the byte array is written to the output stream of the connection. The output stream is then flushed and closed to ensure that all data has been sent."

I want to save the highscore on my server. I think the easiest way is to overwrite a textfile on my server that stores the scores and the names of the top players. How can I do this? The game is not running on my server! It is running on the client side.\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:"
