The code is as followsRandomAccessFile in = new RandomAccessFile('BOT.GRD', \"r\");in.read(a);Now I want to choose file dynamically rather than providing directly as above. I tried a lot and I was unable to do that. Can any one help me on this?\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:"
