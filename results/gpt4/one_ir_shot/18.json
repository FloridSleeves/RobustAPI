Then we set an onClickListener on the button. When the button is clicked, we set the visibility of the text view to GONE, making it disappear. Then we create a new Handler and use its postDelayed method to schedule a Runnable that will be executed after a delay (7000 milliseconds, or 7 seconds in this case). The Runnable's run method sets the visibility of the text view to VISIBLE, making it reappear."
