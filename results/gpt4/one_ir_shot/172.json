The number of bytes actually read is returned as an integer. This method blocks until input data is available, the end of the stream is detected, or an exception is thrown. If the length of buffer is zero, then no bytes are read and 0 is returned; otherwise, there is an attempt to read at least one byte. If no byte is available because the stream is at the end of the file, the value -1 is returned; otherwise, at least one byte is read and stored into buffer."

Getting access to file lines in the currently parsing xml file: :When parsing an XML document, you can set a locator, the locator will tell you what current line and column number your are currently on when different events fire. I am wondering, how can I get the contents of the line, do I have to pass the file, read it into an array myself, isn't this already done by the sax handler, since it is giving me access to the locator, there has to be away to also access the file that the handler is currently working with. Thanks! ::::::::::::::::::::::::::EDIT:::::::::::::::::::I am trying to echo an xml file and want doctype declarations to be included: <!DOCTYPE employee [<!ELEMENT employee (Name, Dept, Title)><!ELEMENT Name (#PCDATA)> <!ELEMENT Dept (#PCDATA)><!ELEMENT Title (#PCDATA)> ]>There is a public void startDTD(String name, String publicId, String systemId);and a public void endDTD();Where you can use the locator to get current line and column, and read from file.There are a couple of things that the SAX parser does not fire events on or give sufficient information as to what was in the read XML file. \nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
