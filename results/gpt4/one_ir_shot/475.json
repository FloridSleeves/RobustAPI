The next() method of Iterator interface in Java is used to return the next element in the iteration. So by iterating through the collection until there are no more elements, the last element accessed by the next() method will be the last element of the collection."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Java get last element of a collection: :I have a collection, I want to get the last element of the collection. What's the most straighforward and fast way to do so?One solution is to first toArray(), and then return the last element of the array. Is there any other better ones?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
