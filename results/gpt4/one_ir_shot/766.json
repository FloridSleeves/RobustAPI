In this code, we create a new PrintWriter object that writes to a file named \"output.txt\". We then modify the showDir method to take this PrintWriter as an argument, and replace all instances of System.out with the writer. This will cause all output that would have been printed to the console to be written to the file instead. Finally, we close the PrintWriter at the end of the main method to ensure that all output is flushed to the file."

I've been searching on the net on how to accomplish this over the last couple of days but I wasn't able to come to a solution.Can someone advise me on what code to use to accomplish my task?Thanks so much!public class ReadFile1 {public static void main(String[] a)throws IOException{showDir(1, new File(\"/Users/User/Documents/1 eclipse test/testfolder1\"));//File file = new File(\"/Users/User/Documents/1 eclipse test/testfolder1/puppy4.txt\");//long fileSize = file.length();}static void showDir(int indent, File file) throws IOException { for (int i = 0; i < indent; i++)      System.out.print('-');System.out.println(file.getName() + \" - \" + file.length() / 1024 + \" KB\");  if (file.isDirectory()) {  File[] files = file.listFiles();  for (int i = 0; i < files.length; i++)    showDir(indent + 4, files[i]);     }}}\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
