The getBytes() method is used to convert the URL string into bytes, which is then updated to the MessageDigest object. The digest() method of the MessageDigest class is then used to complete the hash computation. The resulting hash (digest) is then converted back into a string using a StringBuilder. The \"%02x\" format specifier is used to convert the byte to a two-digit lowercase hexadecimal number. If the MD5 algorithm is not available in the system, it will throw a NoSuchAlgorithmException, which is then caught and a RuntimeException is thrown."

But when I generate the URL of the files, it shows the authentication key, file name and etc. I need to encrypt the URL. Also I am using tiny url to shorten the URL but when I put the curser on the link it shows the real URL. I looked for md5 but I couldn't make it work. Is there any suggestion? \nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:"
