In the given code, we first create a JFileChooser object and open a save dialog. If the user approves the save operation, we get the selected file and create a PrintWriter object for it. Then we use the write method of the PrintWriter class to write the text to the file. The try-with-resources statement ensures that the PrintWriter is closed at the end, even if an exception occurs."
