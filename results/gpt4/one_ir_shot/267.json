By specifying Map.Entry<String, String>, you ensure that the key and value you get from the Map.Entry are Strings. This way, you can directly assign the value to nextSection without needing to call toString(). Also, you were comparing the sectionName with the value of the Map.Entry using '==' operator which is not the correct way to compare Strings in Java. You should use the equals() method instead."

This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Comparing linkedHashMap values to strings in Java: :My question: Why is linkedhashmap returning an object when I am expecting a string (perhaps my expectations are incorrect?), and how can I compare if a string value \"line\" contains the value of the linkedHashMap \"sections\"? I am defining the linked hash map as follows... LinkedHashMap<String, String> sections; sections = new LinkedHashMap();Then, I have collected lines of text from a pdf. If certain conditions are met, II split the text on a white space putting the numerical value \"#######\" as the key and the rest of the line as the value... if (tocStartFound == true && tocEndFound == false) {     if (line.matches(\"\\\\d{6}.+\")){     String lineSplit[] = line.split(\"\\\\s\",2);     sections.put(lineSplit[0], lineSplit[1]); }Now, when i ask if line.contains(nextSection) I am told an \"object cannot be converted to a charSequence.\"if (sectionStarted == true){    Set set = sections.entrySet();    Iterator iter = set.iterator();    boolean foundName = false;    Object nextSection;    while(iter.hasNext()){        Map.Entry me = (Map.Entry)iter.next();        if (foundName == true){            nextSection = me.getValue();            nextSection = nextSection.toString();            break;        }        if (sectionName == me.getValue()) {            foundName = true;        }}Pattern pa = Pattern.compile(\".+((?i)end of section).+\");Matcher ma = pa.matcher(line);if (ma.find() || line.contains(nextSection)){    System.out.println(\"End of Section\");    sectionStarted = false;}I guess I thought by defining the map with <string,string>, i was enduring that the data would be typed as strings.
