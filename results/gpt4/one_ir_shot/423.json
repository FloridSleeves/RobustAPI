This allows us to access the index of the current element, and therefore the previous and next elements. We use the ternary operator to check if there is a previous or next element, and if not, we assign null to the variable."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How do I refer to the previous and next element during an iteration?: :When I have a for loop, I use the i to refer to the elements of my array, objects, etc.  Like:Current item: myArray[i]Next item: myArray[i+1]Previous item: myArray[i-1] But at the moment, I'm using a foreach loop ( for (Object elem : col) { ).How do I refer to the previous item?(I need to do a search an 'array', which I'm doing with for (Object object : getComponents()).  But when it returns true (so it finds what I look for), it should perform the code on the previous and the next item.  Clarification: I have java.awt.Component elements!\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
