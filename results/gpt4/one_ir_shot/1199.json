In this case, we are breaking the binary string into tokens using '0' as the delimiter. Then, for each token (which is a sequence of '1's), we add the positions of '1's to the positions list. The index is updated after each token by adding the length of the token and 1 (for the '0' that was skipped)."

Anyways...Take for example, an 8 bit binary representation of a number in String format, \"01110101\". If I reverse the number, I get \"10101110\". If I wanted to find the positions of each 1 and add them to an array, how would I go about doing that? I tried to use indexOf('1'), but it keeps returning 0 or 1 as the index. Edit: By end result, I mean the overall goal I'm trying to accomplish with all of this, not the question I'm asking. I just wanted to keep someone from jumping in and telling me exactly how to convert from binary to dec rather than answering my current question...Edit2: Okay, I'll be more specific. Basically, I'm trying to take a binary number(s), flip them around and get the positions of the ones and add them to an array. Then I'm going to try to iterate through the array, taking 2 to the power of each position and adding them up. Maybe not the most efficient way to convert from binary to decimal, but it's what I came up with. \nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
