In your case, you are trying to use the Violin class which is defined in the ViolinGonzalezAP3 file. However, you are trying to create an instance of Violin in the ViolinDriverGonzalezAP3 file without importing the ViolinGonzalezAP3 file. To fix this, you need to make sure that the ViolinGonzalezAP3 class is in the same package as the ViolinDriverGonzalezAP3 class. Also, you need to create an instance of ViolinGonzalezAP3 instead of Violin. Furthermore, you need to make the methods and variables in the ViolinGonzalezAP3 class static so that they can be accessed without creating an instance of the class. Finally, you should use the write method of the PrintWriter class to write the output to the file."
