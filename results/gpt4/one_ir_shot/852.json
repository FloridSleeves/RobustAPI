This method blocks until at least one byte of input is available. This method returns the actual number of bytes read, or -1 if the end of the file has been reached. This method can be used to read audio data from a file and process it in chunks, which can help to reduce latency."

Currently the sound system I have is working (basically the same code as the top answer here), but there is a significant stall during every output (~200-300 ms). Since it's a quick game I'm looking for something significant quicker. I'm not experienced with Threads, but would those be applicable here?\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:"
