Instead, you should use the Iterator's own methods to modify the collection during iteration. In this case, you should use the iterator's remove() method to remove the current element from the collection. This method is safe to use during iteration and will not throw a ConcurrentModificationException."

As per the requirement I need to iterate over the keySet of the Map and remove objects which dont need any modification.Conside the code below: public void remove(Map<String,User> removeUser){  Set<String> keySet = removeUser.keySey();  User user = null;  for(String key : keySet){      user = (user) removeUser.get(key);       if(!user.isActive()){                removeUser.remove(key);       }  } }Here in above code, I am getting ConcurrentModificationException when I try to fetch User object after Object removal.Can anyone tell me why it's happening?I have not used multi threading.So not able to understand, from where it generated ConCurrentModification Exception.Even I tried with HashMap and Hashtable, but the problem still exist.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
