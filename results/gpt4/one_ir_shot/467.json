The hasNext() method returns true if the iteration has more elements. The next() method returns the next element in the iteration. The summation function is called recursively until there are no more elements in the iterator, at which point it returns 0. The sum of the current element and the sum of the rest of the elements is then returned."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Different ways of using recursion in Java: :I'm thinking of several elegant ways of writing a simple Lisp-like recursive function in Java that does, let's say, a simple summation.In Common Lisp it would be like this:(defun summation(l)    (if l        (+ (car l) (summation (cdr l)))        0))(summation '(1 2 3 4 5)) ==> 15In Java the one of many possible solutions would be:public int summation(int[] array, int n) {    return (n == 0)            ? array[0]            : array[n] + summation(array, n - 1);}CALL: summation(new int[]{1,2,3,4,5}, 4); //151) Is there any possible way NOT to use the index n? 2) Or leave your solution (non-iterational) which you see as interesting. Thanks.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
