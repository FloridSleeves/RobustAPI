In each iteration, you get the TableRow by its id using the getIdentifier() method of the Resources class, which returns the resource ID for the given name, type and package. Then, you set the OnClickListener for the row. When the row is clicked, the onClick() method of the OnClickListener is called, where you can change the background color of the row and do other stuff like searching the database."

The issue I am trying to figure out is how to make them all able to be clicked without adding 200 lines of TableRow r1 = (TableRow) findViewById(R.id.table_row_1);TableRow r2 = (TableRow) findViewById(R.id.table_row_2);TableRow r3 = (TableRow) findViewById(R.id.table_row_3);TableRow r4 = (TableRow) findViewById(R.id.table_row_4);r1.setOnClickListener(listener);r2.setOnClickListener(listener);r3.setOnClickListener(listener);r4.setOnClickListener(listener);Eventually the rows will take their id's and search the database for the value (I'm going to use each table row as a key for a value in the database to populate a column in the row) but for now I'm just trying to change the background color of the row when each one is clicked.Questions:How can I handle a large number of clickable rows without thousands of lines of redundant code?  Do I need to set an OnClickListener for each row or is there a better method that I am over looking?  Is there a way to do it in the XML maybe?\nPlease using this api: List.get.\nAnswer:"
