It then shuffles this list to randomize the order of the integers. It calculates the sample size based on the specified percentile. It then uses an iterator to select the first 'sampleSize' number of elements from the shuffled list. These selected elements form the random sample. The Iterator.next() method is used to retrieve the next element from the shuffled list."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Generating Random integers within a range to meet a percentile in java: :I am trying to generate random integers within a range to sample a percentile of that range. For example: for range 1 to 100 I would like to select a random sample of 20%. This would result in 20 integers randomly selected for 100. This is to solve an extremely complex issue and I will post solutions once I get this and a few bugs worked out. I have not used many math packages in java so I appreciate your assistance.Thanks!\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
