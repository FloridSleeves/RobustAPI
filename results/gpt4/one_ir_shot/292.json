Then, we use the Collections.min() method to find the entry with the smallest value in the inner map. The min() method uses a comparator, which is created by Map.Entry.comparingByValue(), to compare the entries by their values. Finally, we call getKey() on the entry with the smallest value to get the corresponding key."
