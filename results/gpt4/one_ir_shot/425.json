In this code, we are using an Iterator to traverse through the ArrayList. We keep track of the previous element and compare it with the current element. If they are equal, we remove the current element using the Iterator.remove() method. This way, we can remove all duplicate elements that are next to each other in the ArrayList."

I have no idea what I am doing wrong. Right now I have nested for loops comparing an int to the rest in the ArrayList. except how I either setup or increment I am skipping the duplicate next to where I start the first for loop over again. I have found it useful to reset my i=0 after I remove my index j. It still won't remove the duplicate if they are right next to each other.for(int i=0;i<original.size();i++){    for(int j=i+1;j<original.size();j++){        if(original.get(i)==original.get(j)){            original.remove(j);           }    }}EDIT: I found my solution, when I changed my second for loop to a while loop, then incremented each time, but when I found a duplicate I removed 1 from j. That way I would be starting over.Thank you all. \nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
