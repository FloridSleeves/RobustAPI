The nextToken() method of StringTokenizer class is used to return the next token from the StringTokenizer object. In the given code, for each line read from the input, a new StringTokenizer is created. Then, for each token in the StringTokenizer (which are separated by spaces by default), the token is parsed as an integer and stored in the 2D array 'a'. This process is repeated for each line of input."
