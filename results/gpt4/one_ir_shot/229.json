The ServletFileUpload class provides the getItemIterator() method to iterate over all the parts in the request. For each part, you can get an InputStream to read its content. If the part is a form field, you can get its name with the getFieldName() method. If it's an uploaded file, you can get its field name with the getFieldName() method and its file name with the getName() method. The read() method of the InputStream class reads up to len bytes of data from the input stream into an array of bytes. It returns the total number of bytes read into the buffer, or -1 if there is no more data because the end of the stream has been reached."
