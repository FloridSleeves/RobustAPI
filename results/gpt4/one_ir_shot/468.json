The remove() method of Iterator is used to remove the current element of the collection. It removes the last element returned by next(). This method can be called only once per call to next(). The IllegalStateException is thrown if this method is called more times than next() is called."

All trying to do is remove the product from the array.When I call the method deleteProduct(prod.getId()), it should delete product that I added first.I can use the for loop, then how would delete the product in the array.Any pointers, please?public void deleteProduct(int productId) throws ProductNotFoundException {    Iterator<Product> it = allProducts.iterator();    Product p= null;    int pid = productId;    int i = 0;    if (!allProducts.isEmpty()) {        while(it.hasNext()){            p= it.next();            i= allProducts.indexOf(p);            if (p.getId().equals(productId)){                i= allProducts.indexOf(p);                allProducts.remove(i);                System.out.println(\"Successfully removed the product \" + pid);                return;            }        }    }           throw new ProductNotFoundException (\"No Such Product\");}\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
