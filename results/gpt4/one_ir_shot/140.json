However, if you are writing from multiple threads, you should still synchronize your writes to ensure that messages do not get mixed up. This is because the write method may not write all of the bytes to the channel in one call, especially if you are writing a large amount of data. By synchronizing on the channel object, you ensure that one thread completes its write before another thread begins."

Will the output be serialized correctly?clarification:In my case the class logger holds a FileOutputStream reference, and multiple threads can call logger write, that formats the output and calls FileOutputStream write.Should I synchronize my logger write method to warrant that the messages from multiple threads are not mixed?\nPlease using this api: FileChannel.write.\nAnswer:"
