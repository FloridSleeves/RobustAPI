It starts with an empty list of combinations. For each list, it creates new combinations by appending each element of the list to each existing combination. The new combinations replace the old ones. This process repeats until all lists have been processed. The result is a list of all possible combinations. The Iterator.next API is used implicitly in the for-each loop to iterate over each list and each combination."

If you think of the Object objects as integers, you could see it like this :{{1,2},{10,20,30},{100}}I need to get all possible lists containing exactly one element of each list, that is, come up with this :{{1,10,100},{1,20,100},{1,30,100},{2,10,100},{2,20,100},{2,30,100}}Of course you don't know at compiling time how much items the lists will contain, so you cannot rely on an overlapping of for loops...How would you come up with this? Time constraints are not relevant to my problem because the lists will likely contain few elements.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
