The nextToken() method returns the next token from this string tokenizer's string. In this case, we first call nextToken() to skip the first token (the text), and then we call nextToken() three more times to get the last three numbers. These numbers are then parsed to integers and passed as parameters to the checkForCycle() method."

Have read a txt file with a buffer reader and trying to use a StringTokenizer.The string i have it like this, where some text first and some numbers after. I only need to numbers, and want to skip \"Text\".Test 2 5 1My code:// Check if the graph contains an cycle    StringTokenizer st1 = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());    Graph.checkForCycle(null, Integer.parseInt(st1.()), Integer.parseInt(st1.nextToken()), Integer.parseInt(st1.nextToken()));      As you can see there are 4 sets here and i want the last 3 to be send with the paramenter when i call the method Graph.checkForCycle()Hope someone can help.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
