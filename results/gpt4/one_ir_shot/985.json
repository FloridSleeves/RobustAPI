On the Node.js side, you use the Buffer object to decode the Base64 string back to its original form. The 'base64' argument tells the Buffer object that the string is a Base64 encoded string, and 'utf8' argument is used to specify the encoding of the original string."

This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Encoding a binary as BASE64 in Java and decoding it in node.js: :I have a Pentaho process that is is base64 encoding a binary (pdf) via java - with this command:Step: Load File Content In Memory    Outputs: pdf_contentThenStep: Javascript     Outputs: encStringvar encString = new Packages.java.lang.String( Packages.org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Base64.encodeBase64( pdf_content.getBytes() ) );ThenStep: Rest Client (posts data)On the NodeJs sideconst binary = new Buffer(base64Encoded, 'base64');The problem is that the binary file on the node side differs from that on the source (i have access to and can copy the files around).  Further confusing the matter I introduced an intermediate step saving the base64Encoded string out to disk prior to decoding it.  I also then opened the original file (from the Pentaho Side) and encoded that using the Buffer(fs.readFileSync(originalPath)).toString('base64') and compared the base 64 encoded versions of each.  I was hoping to confirm that the algorithm is different (although there is no guarantee). The files themselves were the same length, and started and finished with no differences.  Scattered about the file were bunch of minor differences.  1 byte here 1 byte there.Other bits: Apache.Commons...Base64 uses \"rfc 2045\" Buffer on the Node Js side uses \"rfc 4648\" (I may be misreading the description).  Questions, Is there a known way to communicate base64 between a Java encoding and Node Js decoding?Are there other recommendation on base64 encoding in Pentaho?\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:"
