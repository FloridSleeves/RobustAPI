Then it creates a byte array of the size you want to read (100 bytes in this case). The readFully() method of the RandomAccessFile object is then used to read the specified number of bytes from the file into the byte array. Finally, a ByteArrayInputStream is created from the byte array. This InputStream will only contain the first 100 bytes of the file."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How can I create constrained InputStream to read only part of the file?: :I want to create an InputStream that is limited to a certain range of bytes in file, e.g. to bytes from position 0 to 100. So that the client code should see EOF once 100th byte is reached.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
