The Iterator interface has two methods: hasNext() and next(). These methods are implemented in the Foo class by delegating to an instance of Iterator<Integer> that is passed in through the constructor. The hasNext() method checks if there are more elements in the iteration, and the next() method returns the next element in the iteration."
