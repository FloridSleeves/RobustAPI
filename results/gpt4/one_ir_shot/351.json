If it is, it returns null. If not, it finds the minimum key in the multimap, which represents the highest priority. It then gets an iterator for the collection of values associated with that key. The next() method of the iterator is used to retrieve the next value in the collection, and the remove() method is used to remove it from the collection. The value is then returned."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Java: :I have to implement Priority Queue using MultiMap. I use MultiMap from Google Collections. The following code creates a MultiMap and adds few elements into it.     Multimap<Integer, String> multimap = HashMultimap.create();    multimap.put(5,\"example\");    multimap.put(1,\"is\");    multimap.put(1,\"this\");    multimap.put(4,\"some\");Now my problem is how to write the pop method? I think that there should be a for loop and it should be iterating through MultiMap. The lowest key should be the highest priority, so in C++ I would set a pointer to the first element and increment it. How to do it in Java?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
