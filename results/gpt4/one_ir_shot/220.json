The value byte is returned as an int in the range 0 to 255. If no byte is available because the end of the stream has been reached, the value -1 is returned. This method blocks until input data is available, the end of the stream is detected, or an exception is thrown. In this code, we read the input stream byte by byte and append it to a StringBuilder. When we detect the end of a command (you need to implement the logic in the isEndOfCommand method), we handle the command and clear the StringBuilder for the next command."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Reading and Handling Streams: :I want to read and handle a stream of String containing single OR multiple commands in one line.I am currently using InputStream in = socket.getInputStream(); for my inputstream.Also for handling the input a typical Thread:public void run() {    String input = \"\";    try {        int data = 0;        while (!isInterrupted()) {            while ((data = in.read()) != -1 && !isInterrupted()) {                input += Integer.toHexString(data);                handleInput(input);            }            try {                sleep(500);            } catch (InterruptedException e) {                break;            }        }        socket.close();        return;    } catch (IOException e) {        main.log(\"Connection lost...\");        main.log(e.toString());        main.stopBTCommunication();        main.startBTServer();    }}handleInput() is designed to handle any String given to it and response correctly. The problem with this implementation would be, that handleInput() is called with every byte read from in.read(). I know, that i could use BufferedReader.readLine(), but that would require every incomming command to have \"\\n\" appended to it, which is NOT the case and can't be changed. I know that         while (!isInterrupted()) {            while ((data = in.read()) != -1 && !isInterrupted()) { is kind of nuisance, but basically it want the Thread to read until nothing new is read, then handle that input and then read again...EDIT:So basically, what i need is a non-blocking read().EDIT2:How can incoming commands and commandchains look like:Select Command: \"s\"ReadLine Command: \"rlXX\" whereby X is a Hex DigitWriteLine Command: \"wlXXSSSSSSSS\" whereby X and S are Hex DigitsSo a commandschain may look like one of the following:\"s\"\"srlff\" = \"s\" + \"rlff\"\"rlffwlbb2e2e2e2erlbb\" = \"s\" + \"rlff\" + \"wlbb2e2e2e2e\" + \"rlbb\"\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
