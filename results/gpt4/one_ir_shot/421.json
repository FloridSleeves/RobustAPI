The getNextHost() method uses the Iterator's next() method to get the next host in the list. If the end of the list is reached, it resets the iterator to the beginning of the list. It then checks the status of the host, and if the host is available (status == job accepted), it returns the host. If the host is not available, it recursively calls getNextHost() to find the next available host. This way, the load is balanced across all hosts."

Currently I simply iterate thru the list looking and establish comms with a host to check its not busy. If not I will send a job to it. This approach tends to mean that the first host in the list tends to get hot constanly with the load not balanced properly with the rest of the available hosts.in pseudocode ..for (Host h : hosts) {    //checkstatus    if status == job accepted break;}I'd like to balance this load properly between the hosts i.e first time host one is used 2nd time the method is used host 2. Just wondering that the most elegant solution to this is ??ThanksW\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
