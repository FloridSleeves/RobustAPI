I want to create a library using JSch from some other apps I am looking to write.  I have the connections ironed out but I am using stdin and stdout right now.I am looking to have a method that accepts a single command in a String and returns an ArrayList with the results.Any assistance would be great!//This vars are in the class.private JSch _jsch;private Session _session;private Channel _channel;Here is my connection methodpublic boolean Connect () throws JSchException{    try {        _jsch = new JSch();        _session = _jsch.getSession(_user, _hostname, _port);              _session.setPassword(_password);        _session.setConfig(\"StrictHostKeyChecking\", \"no\");          _channel = _session.openChannel(\"shell\");        //((ChannelShell)_channel).setPtyType(\"vt100\");        _channel.setInputStream(bais);        _channel.setOutputStream(baos);        _channel.connect(3000);                         }//try to connect    catch (JSchException ex)    {        throw ex;    }    return true;}The goal is once I open the connection I can send this method a command and return the results in an array.  Act based on the results and send more commands.  I don't want to close the connection each time as they will build on the commands that come before it. I am not sure how to work with the Inputs and Output Streams enough to get the results I am looking for.  If you can assist with filling out the following method, I would be grateful.public List<String> ExecuteCommand (String command) {    //run command to existing connection    //Get returned lines to Array List and return the list}Thanks \nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
