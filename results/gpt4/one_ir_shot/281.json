The hasNext() method of Iterator returns true if the iteration has more elements. By checking if there are more elements before calling next(), you can avoid the AssertionError. If there are no more elements, you can throw a NoSuchElementException or handle it in a way that suits your application."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Java.lang.AssertionError in a SortedArrayList: :So I'm making an Contact Manager App in Android. My professor send us a JUnit test so we can know if our code is working correctly. Now every method has passed the test except the iterator test which fails the test. It appears to be a java.lang.AssertionError and I cant seem to figure out a way of fixing it. If you could see the error and point it out to me would be awesome. Thanks in advance\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
