Then, you wrap it with a DataOutputStream. You can use the writeInt() method of DataOutputStream to write an integer to the underlying output stream as four bytes, high byte first. The write(byte[] b) method writes b.length bytes from the specified byte array to the underlying output stream. After writing, you need to call the flush() method to ensure that all buffered data is actually written out. Finally, you can call the toByteArray() method of ByteArrayOutputStream to retrieve the resulting byte array."

This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to use ByteArrayOutputStream and DataOutputStream simultaneously in Java?: :I'm having quite a problem here, and I think it is because I don't understand very much how I should use the API provided by Java.I need to write an int and a byte[] into a byte[].I thought of using a DataOutputStream to solve the data writing with writeInt(int i) and write(byte[] b), and to be able to put that into a byte array, I should use ByteArrayOutputStream method toByteArray().I understand that this classes use the Wrapper pattern, so I had two options:DataOutputStream w = new DataOutputStream(new ByteArrayOutputStream());orByteArrayOutputStream w = new ByteArrayOutputStream(new DataOutputStream());but in both cases, I \"loose\" a method. in the first case, I can't access the toByteArray() method, and in the second, I can't access the writeInt() method.How should I use this classes together?\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:"
