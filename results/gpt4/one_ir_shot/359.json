The hasNext() method simply checks if the iteration has more elements, and the next() method returns the next element in the iteration. The second loop might be slightly faster because it avoids the extra hasNext() check on each iteration, but this is unlikely to have a significant impact on performance. The choice between these two should be based on readability and clarity of the code, not performance."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: which loop is faster?: :I have this loopfor (it= someCollection.iterator; it.hasNext(); ){    //some code here}I changed it to:for (it= someCollection.iterator;; ){    if (!it.hasNext())        break;    //some code here}The second code ran a little bit faster in unit tests in junit on eclipse.Is the second loop faster? I'm asking because the times given by Junit are not too exact, but they give an approximate value\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
