The hasNext() method of Iterator is used to check if there is a next element in the collection. The next() method is used to retrieve the next element in the collection. This way, you can iterate over the collection one element at a time, which is similar to the \"yield return\" construct in C#."

This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Is there a yield return in java for lazy fetching in hibernate?: :I understand that a \"yield return\" (C# construct) is not available in Java. However, when I do lazy loading in Java/Hibernate. What is the recommended way to iterate over the collection using lazy loading and something similar to yield return ?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
