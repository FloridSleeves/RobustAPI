Basically I have a string with 4 words in it, with each word seperated by a #. What I need to do is use the substring method to extract each word and print it out. I am having trouble figuring out the parameters for it though. I can always get the first one right, but the following ones generally have problems.Here is the first piece of the code:word = format.substring( 0 , format.indexOf('#') );Now from what I understand this basically means start at the beginning of the string, and end right before the #. So using the same logic, I tried to extract the second word like so:wordTwo = format.substring ( wordlength + 1 , format.indexOf('#') ); //The plus one so I don't start at the #.But with this I continually get errors saying it doesn't exist. I figured that the compiler was trying to read the first # before the second word, so I rewrote it like so:wordTwo = format.substring (wordlength + 1, 1 + wordLength + format.indexOf('#') );And with this it just completely screws it up, either not printing the second word or not stopping in the right place. If I could get any help on the formatting of this, it would be greatly appreciated. Since this is for a class, I am limited to using very basic methods such as indexOf, length, substring etc. so if you could refrain from using anything to complex that would be amazing! \nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
