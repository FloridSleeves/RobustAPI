The nextToken() method of StringTokenizer class is used to return the next token from the StringTokenizer object. In this case, it is used to separate the input string into two parts: the integer and the string. The integer is then parsed and stored in 'x', and the string is stored in 'y'."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: BufferedReader space separated input: :first I'd like to mention that I am not realy experienced in java, and I searched StackOverFlow for a solution to my problem and either I didn't find it or didn't understand the answer, so I am asking now:i wanted to start working with BufferedReader and didn't find any guide that i understood propely, so i picked up bits from here and there and wrote this example :BufferedReader input = new BufferedReader (new InputStreamReader (System.in));int x = Integer.parseInt(input.readLine());String y = input.readLine();System.out.println(x);this code worked for the input 34 then enter then abc, but at what im trying to achieve i need the input 34 abc separated by space to be inputed together and that x will get 34 and y will get abc. this will work when using Scanner, but the problem is Scanner times out the exercise i'm doing because it's slow.is there any simple way to get those input space separated like it was with Scanner?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
