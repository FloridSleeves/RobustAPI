This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: how can i calculate the length of a string in 4-byte unsigned long in network order (big endian) in Java: :I'm stuck with this. I have to send messages to a server to receive the data that I need. There is a field after the message's header which is \"Length\": The length is the total number of bytes in the payload, which includes  all instances of the Param and Delim fields and excludes the header  and framing characters. The length is a 4-byte unsigned long in  network order (big endian).The only two examples in the documentation are these:if payload is 5022=LoginUser|5028=abc|5029=def|5026=1the length field is <0x00><0x00><0x00><0x27>if payload is 5022=Subscribe|4=558|5026=2the length field is <0x00><0x00><0x00><0x1B>I've tried some approaches without success. Any idea on how to handle with this would be very appreciated. Thank You\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:"
