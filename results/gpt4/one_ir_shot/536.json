The currentPlayerTurn is set to the first player in the map. In the endOfTurn method, we check if the iterator has a next element. If it doesn't, we reset the iterator to the beginning of the players map. Then we set the currentPlayerTurn to the next player in the iterator. This way, when we reach the end of the map, we start from the beginning again."

I have a method called endOfTurn which is called when the player wants to finish their turn, It sets the 'currentPlayerTurn' field to the next player in the Map. However once I reach the end of my map i want it to go back to the first player in the map and go round again and again. Is there a way of doing this? Also yes the players data structure does need to be a map!public class Game {private Map<String,Player> players;private Player currentPlayerTurn;public boolean EndOfTurn(Player currentPlayerTurn) {    //need to set this.currentPlayerTurn to the next player in the Map}I have looked into using an iterator but this doesnt seem to have a reset function or a 'loop around' mode. Any ideas?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
