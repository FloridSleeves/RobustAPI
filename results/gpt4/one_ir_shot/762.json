By iterating over an array of PrintWriter objects, you can write the same string to multiple files. Don't forget to close the PrintWriter after using it to free up system resources and ensure that the output is written to the file."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: PrintWriter to multiple files: :I need to write the same text to multiple files (or streams).Sometimes I need to use Writer, sometimes a PrintWriter, sometimes a OutputStream...One way to do this wold be to extend a PrintWriter to have an array of PrintWriters and overridde each method as follows:class MutiplePrintWriter extends PrintWriter {    private PrintWriter[] outs;    public MutiplePrintWriter(PrintWriter[] outs) { this.out = out; }    public void print(boolean b) { for (PrintWriter out : outs) print(b); }    public void print(char c) { for (PrintWriter out : outs) print(c); }    public void print(char[] s) { for (PrintWriter out : outs) print(s); }    ...}   (and the same for Writer, OutputStream...)Is there a better alternative?Is this already implemented in a library?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
