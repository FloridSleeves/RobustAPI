In the StringPrinter constructor, we initialize the items array with a size of 2. Then, in the toFile() method, we use the PrintWriter.write() method to write each string to the file. After each string, we write a new line using System.lineSeparator(). Finally, we close the PrintWriter with pw.close() to ensure that all changes are written to the file and resources are freed."
