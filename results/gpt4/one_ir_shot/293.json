However, you can use an Iterator and a while loop to achieve the same effect. The hasNext() method of Iterator checks if there are more elements in the collection. If there are and the doesWordMatch is false, it enters the loop and gets the next element using the next() method. If doesWordMatch becomes true, the loop will stop."

This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: add additional parameters to foreach loop: :I have a foreach loop that goesboolean doesWordMatch = false;for(Character[] charArr : charSets){  if(doesWordMatch)    //dosomething  else    break;}I was wondering, is there anyway to put the condition into the for loop? e.g.for(Character[] charArr : charSets && doesWordMatch == true){  //dosomething}edit-- Right, so would this be possible in a while loop? :o\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
