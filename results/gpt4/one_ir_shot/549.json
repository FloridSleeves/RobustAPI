The ImageIO.read() method is used to read the image data from the input file. The ImageIO.getImageWritersByFormatName() method is used to get an Iterator of ImageWriters that support the \"JPEG2000\" format. The Iterator.next() method is used to get the first ImageWriter from the Iterator. The ImageWriter.setOutput() method is used to set the output destination to an ImageOutputStream associated with the output file. Finally, the ImageWriter.write() method is used to write the image data to the output file in the \"JPEG2000\" format."

I went through this way: Preferences -> Java -> Compiler -> Errors / Warnings -> Deprecated and Restricted API. Then i changed errors to warnings. But now i can not use that library efficient, cause eclipse suggest me nothing about that library.My first question is; if there is a better way to do that? Or maybe another way to use this library efficient in eclipse?EDIT: I found out it was a complication of 32 and 64 bit versions. After installing 32bit JDK and reference the jai_imageio.jar it worked fine.And second; Can anybody give a plain example to me about converting .bmp image to jpeg2000 image. That would help a lot to me about undesrtanding the context.Thank you\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
