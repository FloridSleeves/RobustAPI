If they are, it sets isDifferent to true. If they're not, it creates two Iterators to iterate over the two ArrayLists. It then enters a while loop that continues as long as there are more elements in the oldScores ArrayList. Inside the loop, it gets the next Score object from each ArrayList and checks if they're not equal using the equals() method. If they're not equal, it sets isDifferent to true and breaks out of the loop. After the loop, if isDifferent is true, it sends the newScores to the client. Note that this assumes that the Score class has an appropriate equals() method implemented."

I don't care what's the difference, I just want to know if they're not the same.I'm fetching scores list from a database every minute, and only if the scores list that I fetched is different from the one I fetched a minute ago I want to send it to the client.Now the value of the ArrayList is actually a class that I created (that contains name, lvl, rank, score).Do I need to implement equals() on it?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
