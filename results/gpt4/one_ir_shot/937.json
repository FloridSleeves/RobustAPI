And I was thinking it might be a good idea to sum up the unicode values for the first five characters in the string (assuming it has five, otherwise stop where it ends).  Would that be a good idea, or is it a bad one?I am doing this in Java, but I wouldn't imagine that would make much of a difference.\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:"
