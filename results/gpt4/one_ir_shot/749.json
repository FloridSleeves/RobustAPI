In the main method, we are initializing the PrintWriter object with a file output stream that is set to append mode (true). Then we are writing some text to the file using the write method. In the otherMethod, we are also writing some text to the same file. The writer is closed in the finally block to ensure that the writer is closed even if an exception occurs."
