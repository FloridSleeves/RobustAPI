It compares each byte from the two files. If it finds a pair of bytes that are not equal, it sets the areEqual flag to false and breaks the loop. After the loop, it checks the areEqual flag. If it's true, it means all bytes in the two files are equal. If it's false, it means there are some bytes that are not equal."

Improve this question                    can anyone write pseudocode to compare byte to byte in Java. I understand that we use read() to read byte to byte. but how do we do the comparison? \nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
