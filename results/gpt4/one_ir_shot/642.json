Then it sorts the list in descending order based on the values (word counts). After that, it iterates over the first 5 elements of the sorted list and prints the key (word) and value (count) of each entry. The Map.get method is not directly used here, but it is implicitly used when calling entry.getKey() and entry.getValue()."

I am building a word counter in Java using Map<String, Integer> where a word is the String and the amount of times that word was said in a .txt document is Integer. This is all working great...but I am trying to develop a part where it will display at the bottom what the top 5 results are ---> what the top 5 map.values() are.The problem I have run into is after I find the value, I can't get the String with it.Any suggestions would be very helpful to me.\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:"
