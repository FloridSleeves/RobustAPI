This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Order Strings by apperance in Java: :I have a list of string that have already been arranged according to a numeric value.Now I would like to group these strings in the following way.Lets say I have a text file that looks like this:dbcebcdeddacbebcdacedbcdaAnd I would like to order it in a way that would end up like this:dbcdacebebceddedbcdcdaacbSo as you can see it has to group by the letter of the string and stack em together. What would be the most efficient way of accomplishing this task?UPDATE.As you can see the desired order is not alphabetical, that includes reverse. As I mentioned the objective is to group the strings and order them by first appearance. For this example I am using letter to simplify a (lot) more complex problem I am trying to solve. The thing to concentrate with here is the order on which the letter of each string appear. Grouping in a specific order, rather than ordering.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
