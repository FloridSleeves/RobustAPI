If you want to write a double value, you need to convert it to a string first using String.valueOf(). This will write the string representation of the double value to the file, not the binary representation. If you want to write the binary representation, you should use DataOutputStream.writeDouble() as you did in your original code. However, keep in mind that this will not be human-readable."

This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Not working I/O method: :I'm pretty new to JAVA, so I do not really see what I am doing wrong within the following method:public void writeWNDFile(){        String strFilePath = \"C:/Users/fperrone/Desktop/ddd.txt\";        try        {          //create FileOutputStream object          FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(strFilePath);           DataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(fos);           dos.writeDouble(12);                       dos.close();        }        catch (IOException e)        {          System.out.println(\"IOException : \" + e);        }    }The file is actually generated, but I don't get 12 as printed and expected result, but @(, which probably is the ASCII representation.May you shed some light?EDITDoes eventually exist a JAVA function behaving similarly to the MATLAB fwrite function? I actually wanna write a binary file. In MATLAB I am simply calling:fwrite(filename, A, precision)How could I achieve the same in JAVA?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
