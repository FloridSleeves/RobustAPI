The nextToken() method of StringTokenizer class is used to return the next token from the StringTokenizer object. In the given code, we first skip the command token by calling nextToken() once, then we store the next token (which is the email) and the following token (which is the amount)."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Reading Email Addresses as Tokens: :How can I read an email address as a token?I saw that the tokenizer method has a limit of 16 bits of length, well my token is like this:command emailtest@somewhere.com 50I want to be able to store the email (can be any email address) and the number (can vary from 5-1500).  I dont care about the command token.My code looks like this:String test2 = command.substring(7);StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(test2);String email = st.nextToken();String amount = st.nextToken();\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
