I currently have an iterator that starts at the head:public Iterator<E> iterator( ){    return new ListIterator();}All I have for the other one is:public Iterator<E> iterator(int x ){    return new ListIterator();}I'm not sure how to go about utilizing the given position(x) that won't affect my ListIterator constructor which starts at head. I tried using a for loop to get to \"x\" but realized that wouldn't tell the iterator to start there, so I'm quite stumped. Edit:public ListIterator()        {            current = head; // head in the enclosing list        }\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
