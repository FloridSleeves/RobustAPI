Each instance of ServerThread is designed to handle one client connection. When a client connects, the server accepts the connection, creates a new ServerThread to handle the client, and starts the thread. Inside the ServerThread, we get the InputStream from the socket, and read data from it in a loop. When data is available, we read it into a buffer, process the data, and send an acknowledgement to the client. This allows the server to handle multiple clients concurrently, each on its own thread."

Suppose there are 6 clients connected to the server at the same time and each of the clients are sending some commands to server at the same time. If these clients sending the message to server for every 1 second how can I handle the those messages from the 6 clients on the server side to store it in the table and the acknowledgement to each client. How can i handle these input from from the client. Whether I have to create 6 threads to handle these inputs from the client. Please give me a idea to approach this issue.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
