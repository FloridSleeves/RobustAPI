Then, we iterate over the contacts list. For each contact, we get the score (MP) and write it to the PrintWriter, followed by a comma. After the loop, we flush and close the PrintWriter. Finally, we return the string representation of the StringWriter, which contains all the scores separated by commas. The PrintWriter.write method writes a string to the output stream, which in this case is the StringWriter."

It gives a different score every time, which I need to save to a String (or file, but I guess a string would be easier, because I need it to be empty at every new call for the database).I want to store all the scores by going through the loop, and then adding a , after each score (to keep them seperate) but my code isn't working because a part of the code is outside the for loop. How do I fix this? Or are there better/other methods to do what I want to create?DatabaseHandler db = new DatabaseHandler(camera.this);List<Database> contacts = db.getAllContacts();for (Database contact : contacts) {    String test = contact.getMP();    StringWriter stringWriter = new StringWriter();    PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(stringWriter);    printWriter.println(test);}  printWriter.flush();printWriter.close();return stringWriter.toString();\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
