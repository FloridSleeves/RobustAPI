This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Android Split string: :I have  a string called CurrentString and is in the form of something like this\"Fruit: they taste good\". I would like to split up the CurrentString using the : as the delimiter.So that way the word \"Fruit\" will be split into its own string and \"they taste good\" will be another string.And then i would simply like to use SetText() of 2 different TextViews to display that string. What would be the best way to approach this? \nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
