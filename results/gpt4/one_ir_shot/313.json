The new Iterator's next() method will return the first element on the first call and then delegate to the original Iterator's next() method for subsequent calls. The hasNext() method will return true for the first call and then delegate to the original Iterator's hasNext() method for subsequent calls. This way, the first element is effectively placed back on the Iterator."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Iterator retrieve first value and place it back on the same iterator: :I have the following scenario: I have an existing iterator Iterator<String> it and I iterate over its head (say first k elements, which are flagged elements, i.e. they start with '*' ). The only way to know that the flagged elements are over, is by noticing that the (k+1)th element is not flagged. The problem is that if I do that, the iterator it will not provide me the first value anymore on the next call to next().I want to pass this iterator to a method as it's only argument and I would like to avoid changing its signarture and it implementation. I know I could do this:    public void methodAcceptingIterator(Iterator<String> it) //current signature   //change it to   public void methodAcceptingIterator(String firstElement, Iterator<String> it)But this looks like a workarround/hack decreasing the elegance and generality of the code, so I don't want to this. Any ideas how I could solve this problem ?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
