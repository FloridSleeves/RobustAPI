If it doesn't, we create it using the createNewFile() method. Then, we use PrintWriter to write the high scores to the file. The FileOutputStream is used with the parameter 'true' to append the data to the existing file. The write() method of PrintWriter is used to write the high scores to the file. Each high score is written on a new line. The BufferedReader is used to read the high scores from the file at the start of the program."

The problem I have now is that the txt file highscores.txt isn't found anywhere because I haven't created it. Is it possible to have the file created whenever it isn't found? Here is the relevant code:Write highscores to file at gameover: if(gameOver == true){        sbg.enterState(5, new FadeOutTransition(), new FadeInTransition());        if(score > Highscores.highscore3 && score < Highscores.highscore2){            Highscores.highscore3 = score;        }else if(score > Highscores.highscore2 && score < Highscores.highscore1){            Highscores.highscore3 = Highscores.highscore2;            Highscores.highscore2 = score;          }else if(score > Highscores.highscore1){            Highscores.highscore3 = Highscores.highscore2;            Highscores.highscore2 = Highscores.highscore1;            Highscores.highscore1 = score;        }else Highscores.highscore1 = score;        //Write highscores to highscores.txt        try{            PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"highscores.txt\", \"UTF-8\");            writer.println(String.valueOf(Highscores.highscore1));            writer.println(String.valueOf(Highscores.highscore1));            writer.println(String.valueOf(Highscores.highscore1));            writer.close();        }catch(Exception e){            e.printStackTrace();        }        gameOver = false;        gameStart = false;    }Read highscores from highscores.txt at program start:public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException{    BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"highscores.txt\"));    String line;    while((line = in.readLine()) != null){        System.out.println(line);    }    in.close();I know that I can create a file if it doesn't exist like this:try{File save = new File(\"highscores.txt\");if (!save.exists()){    save.createNewFile();System.out.println(\"\\n----------------------------------\");System.out.println(\"The file has been created.\");System.out.println(\"------------------------------------\");}But I don't know how to do that with buffers.
