This method blocks until some input is available. The method returns -1 if there is no more data because the end of the stream has been reached. In your case, you were reading the data in chunks of the size of the file, which might not be efficient for larger files. Instead, you should read the data in smaller chunks (like 1024 bytes) until there is no more data to read (when read() returns -1). This way, you ensure that all the data is read and written, regardless of the file size."
