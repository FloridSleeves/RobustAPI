This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: The simplest way to comma-delimit a list?: :What is the clearest way to comma-delimit a list in Java?I know several ways of doing it, but I'm wondering what the best way is (where \"best\" means clearest and/or shortest, not the most efficient.I have a list and I want to loop over it, printing each value.  I want to print a comma between each item, but not after the last one (nor before the first one).List --> Item ( , Item ) *List --> ( Item , ) * ItemSample solution 1:boolean isFirst = true;for (Item i : list) {  if (isFirst) {    System.out.print(i);        // no comma    isFirst = false;  } else {    System.out.print(\", \"+i);   // comma  }}Sample solution 2 - create a sublist:if (list.size()>0) {  System.out.print(list.get(0));   // no comma  List theRest = list.subList(1, list.size());  for (Item i : theRest) {    System.out.print(\", \"+i);   // comma  }}Sample solution 3:  Iterator<Item> i = list.iterator();  if (i.hasNext()) {    System.out.print(i.next());    while (i.hasNext())      System.out.print(\", \"+i.next());  }These treat the first item specially; one could instead treat the last one specially.Incidentally, here is how List toString is implemented (it's inherited from AbstractCollection), in Java 1.6:public String toString() {    Iterator<E> i = iterator();    if (! i.hasNext())        return \"[]\";    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();    sb.append('[');    for (;;) {        E e = i.next();        sb.append(e == this ? \"(this Collection)\" : e);        if (! i.hasNext())            return sb.append(']').toString();        sb.append(\", \");    }}It exits the loop early to avoid the comma after the last item.  BTW: this is the first time I recall seeing \"(this Collection)\"; here's code to provoke it:List l = new LinkedList();l.add(l);System.out.println(l);I welcome any solution, even if they use unexpected libraries (regexp?); and also solutions in languages other than Java (e.g. I think Python/Ruby have an intersperse function - how is that implemented?).Clarification: by libraries, I mean the standard Java libraries.  For other libraries, I consider them with other languages, and interested to know how they're implemented.EDIT toolkit mentioned a similar question: Last iteration of enhanced for loop in javaAnd another:Does the last element in a loop deserve a separate treatment?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
