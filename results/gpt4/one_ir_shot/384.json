The compareTo() method of the String class is used to compare two strings lexicographically. If the current string is lexicographically less than the min string, it becomes the new min. If it is lexicographically greater than the max string, it becomes the new max. This way, at the end of the iteration, you have the lexicographically smallest and largest strings. This can be useful in programs where you need to sort or compare strings based on their lexicographic order."

And how can it be useful in a program?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
