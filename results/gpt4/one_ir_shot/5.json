It returns a view which can be cast to your desired view type. In your case, you are trying to access the searchButton from another class. You should pass the activity instance to the other class and then use it to find the view. You should not create a new instance of an activity using the new keyword. Instead, you should pass the existing instance of the activity to the other class."

In this class I have some variables and I'd like to use them in another class. This is the code:public class SearchView {    private MenuActivity menuActivity;    public SearchView() {        menuActivity = new MenuActivity();        menuActivity.searchButton = (ImageView) menuActivity.findViewById(R.id.searchButton);    }}Last line gives me a NullPointerException.
