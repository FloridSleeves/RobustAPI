It then tries to parse the accumulated text using ANTLR. If the parsing is successful, it resets the StringBuilder and continues with the next line. If the parsing fails (because the command is split into multiple lines), it just continues reading and appending to the StringBuilder. This way, it can handle commands that span multiple lines."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Interactive Antlr: :I'm trying to write a simple interactive (using System.in as source) language using antlr, and I have a few problems with it. The examples I've found on the web are all using a per line cycle, e.g.:while(readline)  result = parse(line)  doStuff(result)But what if I'm writing something like pascal/smtp/etc, with a \"first line\" looks like X requirment? I know it can be checked in doStuff, but I think logically it is part of the syntax.Or what if a command is split into multiple lines? I can trywhile(readline)  lines.add(line)  try    result = parse(lines)    lines = []    doStuff(result)  catch    nopBut with this I'm also hiding real errors.Or I could reparse all lines everytime, but:it will be slow there are instructions I don't want to run twiceCan this be done with ANTLR, or if not, with something else?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
