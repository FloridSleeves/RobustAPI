You may have recently seen a post by me looking for help, but I did it wrong before, so I am going to start fresh and begin at the basics.I am trying to read a text file that looks like this:FTFFFTTFFTFT  3054 FTFFFTTFFTFT  4674 FTFTFFTTTFTF  ... etcWhat I need to do is put the first line into a String as the answer key.Next, I need to create an array with the student ID (the first numbers).Then, I need to create an array that is parallel to the student ID that contains the student's answers.Below is my code, and I can't quite figure out how to get it to work like this, and I was wondering if someone could help me out with it.public static String[] getData() throws IOException {      int[] studentID = new int[50];      String[] studentAnswers = new String[50];      int total = 0;      String line = reader.readLine();      strTkn = new StringTokenizer(line);      String answerKey = strTkn.nextToken();      while(line != null) {        studentID[total] = Integer.parseInt(strTkn.nextToken());        studentAnswers[total] = strTkn.nextToken();        total++;      }    return studentAnswers;    }So at the end of the day, the array structure should look like:studentID[0] = 3054studentID[1] = 4674... etcstudentAnswers[0] = FTFFFTTFFTFTstudentAnswers[1] = FTFTFFTTTFTFThanks :)\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
