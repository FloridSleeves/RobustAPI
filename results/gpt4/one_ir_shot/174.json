This method returns a Process object for managing the subprocess. The getInputStream() method of the Process class returns the input stream connected to the normal output of the subprocess. The read() method of the InputStream class reads the next byte of data from the input stream. The value byte is returned as an int in the range 0 to 255. If no byte is available because the end of the stream has been reached, the value -1 is returned. This method blocks until input data is available, the end of the stream is detected, or an exception is thrown. The System.out.print() method prints the characters as they are read."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Redirect process output to stdout: :I would like to execute foo.bat from within a Groovy program and have the resulting process' output redirected to stdout. Either a Java or Groovy code example would be fine.foo.bat can take several minutes to run and generates a lot of output, so I would like to see the output as soon as it is generated, rather than having to wait until the process has completed before seeing all the output at once.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
