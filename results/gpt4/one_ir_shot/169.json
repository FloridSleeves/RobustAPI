However if my network goes down the the process of reading the file the read method blocks and is never recovers if the network reappears. I was wondering how I should handle this case and should some exception not be thrown if the InputStream goes away. Code is like this. Url someUrl = new Url(\"http://somefile.com\");InputStream inputStream = someUrl.openStream();byte[] byteArray = new byte[];int size = 1024;inputStream.read(byteArray,0,size);So somewhere after calling read the network goes down and the read method blocks. How can i deal with this situation as the read doesn't seem to throw an exception. \nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
