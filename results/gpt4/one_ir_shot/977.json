When you load the file into a String, each character in the file is stored as a Unicode character in memory. This can significantly increase the size of the String in memory, especially for files that contain a lot of characters that only require 1 byte in their encoded form. The getBytes() method of the String class can be used to get the byte representation of the String, which can then be used to calculate the size of the String in memory."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: File size vs. in memory size in Java: :If I take an XML file that is around 2kB on disk and load the contents as a String into memory in Java and then measure the object size it's around 33kB.Why the huge increase in size?If I do the same thing in C++ the resulting string object in memory is much closer to the 2kB.To measure the memory in Java I'm using Instrumentation.For C++, I take the length of the serialized object (e.g string).\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:"
