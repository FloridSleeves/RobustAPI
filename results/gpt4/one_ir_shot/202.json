The value byte is returned as an int in the range 0 to 255. If no byte is available because the end of the stream has been reached, the returned value is -1. The code reads two bytes at a time from the InputStream, combines them into a 16-bit value (with the first byte being the high byte), adds that value to the checksum, and then uses bitwise AND to discard any overflow bits, effectively implementing a modulo operation with 0x10000 (65536). This is equivalent to the behavior of the original C code, which also discards overflow bits due to the use of a 16-bit unsigned integer for the checksum."

For this i want to port a code snipped from C into Java:static uint16 getchecksum(uint8 *rom, int length){  int i;  uint16 checksum = 0;  for (i = 0; i < length; i += 2)  {    checksum += ((rom[i] << 8) + rom[i + 1]);  }  return checksum;}I understand what the code does. It sums all 16bit numbers (combined from two 8 bit ones). But what i didn't understand is what's happening with the overflow of the uint16 and how this transfers to Java code?Edit:This code seems to work, thanks:int calculatedChecksum = 0;int bufferi1=0;int bufferi2=0;bs = new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(this.file));bufferi1 = bs.read();bufferi2 = bs.read();while(bufferi1 != -1 && bufferi2 != -1){    calculatedChecksum += (bufferi1*256 + bufferi2);    calculatedChecksum = calculatedChecksum % 0x10000;    bufferi1 = bs.read();    bufferi2 = bs.read();}\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
