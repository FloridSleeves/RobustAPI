It's often better to refactor the class to separate concerns. However, in some cases, partial mocking can be useful. For example, when working with legacy code that can't be easily refactored, or when interacting with external systems. In this case, we're creating a mock InputStream and specifying that when the read method is called, it should return 1. This allows us to isolate the behavior we're testing from the actual file reading logic."

This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Easymock partially mocking (EasyMock ClassExtension), good or bad?: :I have written quite a few Mock objects using EasyMock. However, often i find writing partial mocks time consuming, and it does not feel 'right'.I'd say its a design fault as my class I try to mock has multiple concerns into one, therefore I should create seperate classes in order to seperate concerns.What do you think? Is partially mocking a good or bad thing? And, if good/bad, why? What would you suggest if you notice you cannot mock the object because you only want to mock a few methods?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
