The 'seek' method of RandomAccessFile sets the file-pointer offset, measured from the beginning of the file, at which the next read or write occurs. In this case, we are setting the pointer to the end of the file (raf.length()) before writing, effectively appending the new encrypted message to the end of the file."

Unfortunately, cryptography is not my strong side. Now I can write to file several messages and then close file. Then i can open it, append some messages, close again and after decryption I see padding bytes in the middle of file. Is there any way to work with encrypted file without having to decrypt it every time I want to append some messages?EDIT: little more details. Current implementation utlizes CipherOutputStream. As i understand there's no way to seek using it.Can i use 'NoPadding' option if i will control that output data size is divisible by block size?\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.write.\nAnswer:"
