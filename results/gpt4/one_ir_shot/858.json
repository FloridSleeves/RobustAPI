It calculates the number of bytes each split file should contain (bytesPerSplit) and the remaining bytes. It then reads and writes these bytes into each split file.

Here is how I read the file:int n = 4;BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"file.csv\"));try {    String line = br.readLine();    while (line != null) {        line = br.readLine();    }} finally {    br.close();}How do I split the file - file.csv into n files?Note - Since the number of entries in the file are of the order of 100k, I can't store the file content into an array and then split it and save into multiple files.\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:"
