Finally, close the PrintWriter to free up system resources."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to execute cmd commands via Java: :I am trying to execute command line arguments via Java. For example:// Execute commandString command = \"cmd /c start cmd.exe\";Process child = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(command);// Get output stream to write from itOutputStream out = child.getOutputStream();out.write(\"cd C:/ /r/n\".getBytes());out.flush();out.write(\"dir /r/n\".getBytes());out.close();The above opens the command line but does not execute cd or dir. Any ideas? I am running Windows XP, JRE6.(I have revised my question to be more specific. The following answers were helpful but do not answer my question.)\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
