Inside the loop, we are using a try-catch block to handle any exceptions that might be thrown when processing each element. If an exception is thrown, the catch block will handle it and the loop will continue with the next element. This allows us to maintain the foreach syntactic sugar while still being able to handle exceptions. The Iterator.next() method is implicitly called for each iteration of the loop."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Exception handling in Iterable: :Is there any way of handling -- and continuing from -- an exception in an iterator while maintaining the foreach syntactic sugar?I've got a parser that iterates over lines in a file, handing back a class-per-line.  Occasionally lines will be syntactically bogus, but that doesn't necessarily mean that we shouldn't keep reading the file.My parser implements Iterable, but dealing with the potential exceptions means writingfor (Iterator iter = myParser.iterator(); iter.hasNext(); ) {  try {    MyClass myClass = iter.next();    // .. do stuff ..  } catch (Exception e) {    // .. do exception stuff ..  }}.. nothing wrong with that, but is there any way of getting exception handling on the implicit individual iter.next() calls in the foreach construct?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
