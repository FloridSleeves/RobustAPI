The data is then converted to a String. The String.split() method is used to split the string into substrings based on the specified delimiter, which in this case is two right parenthesis. Then, for each substring, the indexOf() method is used to find the index of the carriage return character. If the carriage return character is found, the substring from the start of the string to the carriage return character is printed."
