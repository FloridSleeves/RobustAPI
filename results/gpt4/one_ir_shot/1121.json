It reads the next token from the input as a String. This code reads words from the input until it encounters the word \"okay\", at which point it breaks out of the loop. The words are stored in an ArrayList, which can dynamically resize unlike an array. After all words are read, the ArrayList is converted to an array. The array is then iterated over and each word is printed out."

This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Create a string array with length determined by user input: :I am trying to create an array that reads string tokens from standard input, and places them in an array, and then prints the words out, until it reaches a specific word. For example, let's say I wanted my array to read a series of words until it reached the word \"okay\" from std in, print out each word, and then terminate before printing out \"okay\". The length of this array will be unknown, so I am confused on how to do this.     String s  = sc.next();     String[] copy = new String[???];     for( int i = 0; i < copy.length; i++ ){           copy[i] = sc.next();          }\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
