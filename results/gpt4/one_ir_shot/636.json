The getOrDefault method is used to get the current count of a number, and if the number is not yet in the map, it defaults to 0. Then, it iterates over the values in the map, and if a value is exactly 2 (meaning the number appears exactly twice in the array), it increments the count. The final count is the number of unique pairs in the array."

This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Efficient way to count unique pairs in int array: :This is my first post, hope it complies with posting guidelines of the site.First of all a generic thanks to all the community: reading you from some months and learned a lot :o)Premise: I'm a first years student of IT.Here's the question: I'm looking for an efficient way to count the number of unique pairs (numbers that appear exactly twice) in a given positive int array (that's all I know), e.g. if:int[] arr = {1,4,7,1,5,7,4,1,5};the number of unique pairs in arr is 3 (4,5,7).I have some difficulties in... evaluating the efficiency of my proposals let's say.Here's the first code I did:int numCouples( int[] v ) {int res = 0;int count = 0;for (int i = 0 ; i < v.length; i++){    count = 0;    for (int j = 0; j < v.length; j++){        if (i != j && v[i] == v[j]){            count++;        }    }    if (count == 1){        res++;    }}return res/2;}This shoudn't be good cause it checks the whole given array as many times as the number of elements in the given array... correct me if I'm wrong.This is my second code:int numCouples( int[] v) {int n = 0;int res = 0;for (int i = 0; i < v.length; i++){    if (v[i] > n){        n = v[i];    }}int[] a = new int [n];for (int i = 0; i < v.length; i++){    a[v[i]-1]++;}for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++){    if (a[i] == 2){        res++;    }}return res;}I guess this should be better than the first one since it checks only 2 times the given array and 1 time the n array, when n is the max value of the given array. May be not so good if n is quite big I guess...Well, 2 questions:am I understanding good how to \"measure\" the efficiency of the code?there's a better way to count the number of unique pairs in a given array?EDIT:Damn I've just posted and I'm already swamped by answers! Thanks! I'll study each one with care, for the time being I say I don't get those involving HashMap: out of my knowledge yet (hence thanks again for the insight:o) )\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:"
