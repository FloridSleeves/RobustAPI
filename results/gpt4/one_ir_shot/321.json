However, you can achieve the same effect by using an Iterator directly. The hasNext() method of Iterator is used in the loop condition to check if there are more elements. The next() method is used to retrieve each element in turn. The variable y is incremented in each iteration."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Java why does no third syntax for for (each) loops exist?: :I know that currently there are two approaches to loop over an List. But let's complicate it a bit more, consider:You iterate over List<E> list.You want to keep track of an int y on every iteration.There exists a function process(E elem, int y) that processes an item.Option 1:for (int i = 0, y = 0; i < list.size(); i++, y++) {    process(list.get(i), y);}which actually just isfor (int i = 0; i < list.size(); i++) {    process(list.get(i), i);}Option 2:int y = 0;for (E elem : list) {    process(elem, y);    y++;}which can be rewritten toint y = 0;for (E elem : list) {    process(elem, y++);}However why does the following not exist? What are the objections to it not existing?Option 3:for (int y = 0; E elem : list; y++) {    process(elem, y);}Two arguments to have this construct:Both foreach syntaxes are distinguishableMany objects implement Iterable<E>, but have no for counterpart. This happens when an Iterable<E> has no order associated with it for example.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
