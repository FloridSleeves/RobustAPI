This is a special case of a reduction.

Intuitively, the expected result:dog fish cat fish cat dogIf you try the obvious solution, looping through with replaceAll(), you get:(original) cat dog fish dog fish cat(cat -> dog) dog dog fish dog fish dog(dog -> fish) fish fish fish fish fish fish(fish -> cat) cat cat cat cat cat catClearly, this is not the intended result. So what's the simplest way to do this? I can cobble something together with Pattern and Matcher (and a lot of Pattern.quote() and Matcher.quoteReplacement()), but I refuse to believe I'm the first person to have this problem and there's no library function to solve it. (FWIW, the actual case is a bit more complicated and doesn't involve straight swaps.)\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
