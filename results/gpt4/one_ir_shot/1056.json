I get somewhat unpredictable results. white space in the first slot, sometimes the number itself isn't where I thought it should be.Can anybody please help and give me advice on how I can use a reg exp to keep ONLY the integers?I was asked to give the code trying to do the actual split. So allow me to do that in hopes to clarify further my problem :)String temp = \"0|0\";String splitString = temp.split(\"|\");results\\n0| 0I am trying to get00only. Forever grateful for any help ahead of time :)\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
