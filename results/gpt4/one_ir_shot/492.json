When adding an entry to the map, we first check if the map has reached its maximum size. If it has, we use an iterator to remove the oldest entry before adding the new one. When reading and clearing the map, we also use a synchronized block to ensure that no other thread can modify the map while we are reading it. The Iterator.next() method is used to get the next entry in the map."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: thread safe LinkedHashMap without Collections.synchronized: :I am using a LinkedHashMap and the environment is multi threaded so this structure needs to be thread safe. During specific events I need to read the entire map push to db and clear all. Most of time only writes happen to this map. This map has a limit 50 entries.I am using Oracle MAF and it does not have Collections.syncronizedMap available. So, what are things I need to put in synchronized blocks to make sure writing and reading doesn't hit me concurrentModificationException etcFew requirements:I need to behave it like a circular queue so Overriding removeEldestEntry method of the LinkedHashMap. I need to preserve the order\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
