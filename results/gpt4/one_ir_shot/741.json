The setContentType() method is used to set the MIME type of the response to \"text/csv\", which tells the browser that the data should be treated as a CSV file. The setHeader() method is used to set the \"Content-Disposition\" header of the response to \"attachment; filename=my\" + offerType + \"Offers.csv\", which tells the browser to treat the response as a file to be downloaded, with the specified filename. The flush() method is called to ensure that any buffered output is written out, and the close() method is called to close the PrintWriter."

On chrome, it directly downloads the file as a *.csv format and when the user opens it, it will use Excel automatically to open the file, if they already have installed and this is the right behavior I wanted to have.However, on firefox, it prompts a save as window with open with and save options. If I use open with option, it tells me the filename is filename.csv but the type is chrome htm file. I haven't mentioned htm anywhere in my code and I dont know why its trying  to open it as htm instead of csv file. Once it tries to open it, it brings excel application and the contents are in a bad format.Is there a way to avoid this problem on firefox ?Thanks\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
