The write() method of PrintWriter class is used to write a string to the file. The PrintWriter needs to be initialized with the File object. If the file does not exist, a FileNotFoundException will be thrown, so it's necessary to catch this exception. After writing to the file, it's important to close the PrintWriter using the close() method to free up system resources."

When I execute the program below it gives me a Filenotfoundexeption error on line 9. It also fails to make the file in the directory that I specified. I am new to this so please try and keep the answers simple. I am using Eclipse.import java.io.PrintWriter;import java.io.File;public class Testing {  public static void main(String[] args) {    File file = new File (\"C:/Users/Me/Desktop/directory/file.txt\");    PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter (\"file.txt\");    printWriter.println (\"hello\");    printWriter.close ();         }}\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
