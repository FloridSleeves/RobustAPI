The value byte is returned as an int in the range 0 to 255. If no byte is available because the end of the stream has been reached, the returned value is -1. This method blocks until input data is available, the end of the stream is detected, or an exception is thrown. In this code, we are executing a command using the Runtime.exec() method and reading the output of the command using InputStream.read()."

I am really stuck up to access terminal window of mac through java code programmatically. It would be really useful if you provide your valuable solutions to perform my task which i have been struggling to do for a past two days. I am also posting the piece of code that I am trying to do for your reference. Any kind of help would be helpful for mepublic class TerminalScript{    public static void main(String args[]){        try {            Process proc = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(\"/Users/xxxx/Desktop/NewFolder/keytool -genkey -v -keystore test.keystore -alias test -keyalg RSA -sigalg SHA1withRSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000\");             BufferedReader read = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(                    proc.getInputStream()));            try {                proc.waitFor();            } catch (InterruptedException e) {                System.out.println(e.getMessage());            }            while (read.ready()) {                System.out.println(read.readLine());            }        } catch (IOException e) {            System.out.println(e.getMessage());        }    }}Note: I have to run the command keytool -genkey -v -keystore test.keystore -alias test -keyalg RSA -sigalg SHA1withRSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 in terminal through java program.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
