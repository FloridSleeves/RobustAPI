It then iterates over each entry in the TreeMap. For each entry, it checks if the interval is before the end of the date range and not after the start of the date range. If it is, it calculates the overlap between the interval and the date range. If there is an overlap, it adds the overlap and the corresponding object to the result TreeMap."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Compare a dateRange with other continous dates in another list to get adjacent ranges relative to the list compared: :e.g.There is a date range from Feb9 thru May 19 in an interval. There is another list of effective dates in a Map for key values like  as of this date this object is returned (Jan 1, Object x), (Feb 1, Object y), (March 1, Object z) (April 1, Object a) (May 1, Object u), (June1, Object n) etc.The algorithm need is to take the date range of Feb1 thru June19 and to get adjacent dates for the effective date ranges e.g.the method would be TreeMapreturnTemporalAdjacentInterval(Interval when)result should be Treemap sorted by adjacent interval with (Feb9-March1, Object y) (March1-April1, Object z) (April1-May1, Object a) (May1-May19, Object u)This is like martin fowlers temporal collection however more of a temporal adjacent interval retrieval. Language is Java joda-time Interval is suggested use for the returned intervals.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
