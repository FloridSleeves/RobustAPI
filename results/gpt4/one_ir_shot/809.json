This method fetches data from LDAP (not shown), writes this data as JSON to the response body using PrintWriter.write, and sends it back to the client. On the client side, we use JQuery's autocomplete function to send a request to the \"/autocomplete\" endpoint whenever the user types in the input field. The server's response is then used as the source for the autocomplete suggestions."
