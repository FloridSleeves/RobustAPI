After the comparison, it closes both InputStreams to free up system resources."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: file comparison with memory consideration: :I want to compare two files, one is in file system and the other is being downloaded from a HTTP URL. We have tried to compare by byte[] arrays (we used HTTPRequestBuilder by Apache), but the concern is that the files may be too large and they may exhaust the memory. Do we have any good alternates.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
