If the output file (in this case, \"logFile.log\") does not exist, it will be created. If it does exist, the FileOutputStream constructor's second parameter is set to true, which means that the new data will be written to the end of the file rather than overwriting the existing content. If an error occurs while creating or writing to the file, the catch block will handle the exception and print the stack trace."
