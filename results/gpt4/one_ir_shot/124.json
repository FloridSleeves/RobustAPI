It then sets the first three bytes to specific values and fills the next four bytes with random values. It then copies the encoded command into the byte array starting at position 46. The length of the command is then written into the byte array at positions 44 and 45. Finally, a DatagramPacket is created with the byte array."

It's pretty simple - it sends some data to a UDP port and looks at the result. I'm not a Python guy, and haven't done too much socket programming, but I've figured out the translation of everything except one line:packet = (b'\\x0C\\x15\\x33\\x00' + os.urandom(4) + (b'\\x00' * 38) + struct.pack('<H', len(enccmd)) + enccmd).ljust(512, b'\\x00')enccmd is a string containing a command that was encoded previously/This is building the data packet that's going to be sent. I know that this translates into the creation of a DatagramPacket object, I just don't know how to do it.Can anyone help?\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:"
