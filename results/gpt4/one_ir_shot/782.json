Then, a new file named \"test.txt\" is created in this directory using the createNewFile() method. If the file does not already exist, it is created. A PrintWriter object is then created for the file, and the write() method is used to write a string to the file. The writer is then closed using the close() method. If any exception occurs during this process, it is caught and its message is printed."
