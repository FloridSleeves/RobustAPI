This means that every time you call these methods, you are starting from the beginning of the list. To fix this, you should create the iterator once and use this same iterator for all subsequent calls to next() and end(). This way, the iterator will keep track of its position in the list across multiple calls to these methods."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Infinite loop because the iterator doesn't move: :There is a some class which implementing an interface Selector. I should use iterator() in its methods. private class SequenceSelector implements Selector {    private T obj = items.iterator().next();    public boolean end() { return !items.iterator().hasNext(); }    public T current() { return obj; }    public void next() { obj = items.iterator().next(); }}items is a ArrayList. obj is a value in order to save the first sequence member before the first next() using.With a following code the program goes into an infinite loop in which is printed only the first member of sequence. while(!selector.end()) {      System.out.print(selector.current() + \" \");      selector.next();}Why does this happens? Though I use next() method, the iterator doesn't move.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
