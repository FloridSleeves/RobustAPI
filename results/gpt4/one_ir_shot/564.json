It can be a way to provide read-only access to the list. However, it does not completely prevent modification of the list, as the Iterator.remove method can still be used to remove elements. If you want to prevent this, you could return an iterator of an unmodifiable view of the list."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Is returning an iterator of private List (in class) considered bad practice?: :Suppose I have two classes: Animal and Zoo, which has private List containing instances of Animal. Reason why I want to return iterator is to avoid defining setters and getters and removal methods. Does that break encapsulation?class Zoo{    private List<Animal> animalList;    public Zoo(){        animalList = new ArrayList<Animal>();    }    public void addAnimal(Animal animal){        animalList.add(animal);    }    public Iterator<Animal> iterator(){        return animalList.iterator();    }}class Animal{    private String name;    private double weight, height;    Animal(String name, double weight, double height){        this.name = name;        this.weight = weight;        this.height = height;    }}\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
