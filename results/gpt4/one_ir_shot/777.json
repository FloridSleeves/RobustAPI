The write() method writes the specified string to the file. The FileOutputStream is an output stream for writing data to a File or to a FileDescriptor. The second parameter of FileOutputStream constructor is set to true which means it will append to the end of the file rather than start at the beginning. The close() method of PrintWriter class is used to close the writer."

I want to know is it possible to write a text file throughout the java program till end of the program. I have tried to write a text file using bufferedWriter.write(). First three lines are writing and after that it is not at all writing any text. I have tried flush. My question is,do we have possibility to open file at starting of the program and write lines when ever we need in the middle of the program and as many number of lines and close the file end of the program?If possible, request to share any same code. I am fine with any file write method (File Writer, Buffered writer, file output stream)\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
