I have written the following code , I have a hashmap named map, it includes integer keys and double values :    Set<Integer> keys = sorted_map.keySet();    Object[] weel = new Object[keys.size()];    Iterator it = keys.iterator();    int l = 0;    while(it.hasNext())    {        weel[l] = it.next();    }Now I have an array that includes the keys of my map. but now I need to compare these keys with some integer. for example :                if(weel[1] == 5) but as the weel type is Object, I can not do the above and also I cannot cast it to int. how can I do this? is it possible?  \nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
