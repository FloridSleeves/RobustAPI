We get an iterator for the collection using the iterator() method. The hasNext() method returns true if the iteration has more elements. The next() method returns the next element in the iteration. In the loop, we are getting each Transaction object from the queue and printing it."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Iteration through data structures(queue, stacks, bags): :Queue<Transaction> collection = new Queue<Transaction>andfor(Transaction t: collection){ StdOut.println(t); }From my understanding of objects, it looks like we just created an object, the queue, of datatype transaction(type parameter) and collection is the reference to that object. Correct? Then the second bit of code is what confuses me. We are looping to print whats in the queue but i'm not sure i understand how this works. collection points to the Queue of type Transaction. It looks like we are creating a reference t to the object Transaction and doing something with it to the reference collection. Pretty confused.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
