The nextToken() method returns the next token from this string tokenizer's string. The countTokens() method calculates the number of times that this tokenizer's nextToken method can be called before it generates an exception. The hasMoreTokens() method returns true if and only if there is at least one token in the string after the current position."

This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How do I return an array of words given an input sentence (string)?: :How do I create a method that takes a string as an argument, and returns the array whose elements are the words in the string. This is what I have came up with so far:// split takes some string as the argument, and returns the array// whose elements are the words in the stringpublic static String[] split (String s){    // determine the number of words    java.util.Scanner t = new java.util.Scanner (s);    int countWords = 0;    String w;    while (t.hasNext ())    {        w = t.next ();        countWords++;    }    // create appropriate array and store the string\u2019s words in it    // code here}As you can see, I can just input each word via Scanner. Now I just have to put all the words of the String into an array as the elements. However, I'm not sure how to proceed.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
