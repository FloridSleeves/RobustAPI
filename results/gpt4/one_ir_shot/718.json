It works like PrintStream class but unlike PrintStream class, it is character-oriented and not byte-oriented. The second parameter in the PrintWriter constructor is a boolean that indicates whether the PrintWriter should automatically flush the stream whenever a newline is written. If set to false, the stream will not be flushed, and you can manually flush the stream by calling writer.flush(). This allows you to control when the stream is flushed, potentially improving performance by reducing the number of flush operations."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Does a PrintWriter / PrintStream need to be flushed?: :I'd like to use a PrintWriter or PrintStream to write formatted strings out to an outputstream (for which I have no control over the creation).  However flushing the underlying OutputStream has a big performance hit.Does a PrintWriter / PrintStream need to be flushed.If I need to flush the PrintStream / PrintWriter; can I do so without flushing the underlying OutputStream, or will I need to create a \"flush protecter\" OutputStream to wrap the underlying stream?To try to be a little clearer on this I want to implement public void writeSomeString(OutputStream foo);But this method may be called many times for the same OutputStream (foo).  Each call will have to construct its own PrintWriter.  I know it's ugly to do so but I have no control over the interface or the creation of foo.I'm trying to avoid each method having to flush foo just to flush its own PrintWriter / PrintStream.So I want to:public void writeSomeString(OutputStream foo) {    PrintStream s = new PrintStream(foo);    s.println(\"bar\");    // other code}I want to completely avoid this method flushing foo \nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
