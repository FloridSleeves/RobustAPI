This means you can read from and write to any location in the file at any time. The setLength(0) method is used to truncate the file to a size of 0, effectively emptying the file."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: File truncate operation in Java: :What is the best-practice way to truncate a file in Java? For example this dummy function, just as an example to clarify the intent:void readAndTruncate(File f, List<String> lines)        throws FileNotFoundException {    for (Scanner s = new Scanner(f); s.hasNextLine(); lines.add(s.nextLine())) {}    // truncate f here! how?}The file can not be deleted since the file is acting as a place holder.\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:"
