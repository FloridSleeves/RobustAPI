If the data is larger than the key size, it needs to be divided into segments for encryption. In the code above, the data is divided into segments and each segment is encrypted separately. The encrypted segments are then combined to form the final encrypted data. The MAX_ENCRYPT_BLOCK is a constant that should be set to the key size minus 11."
