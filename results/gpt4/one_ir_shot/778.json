In your original code, you were creating a new PrintWriter object and closing it within the while loop for each line of input. This was overwriting the file for each line, resulting in only the last line being written to the file. In the corrected code, the PrintWriter object is created before the loop and closed after the loop, so all lines are written to the same file. The System.lineSeparator() method is used to add a new line after each line of input."
