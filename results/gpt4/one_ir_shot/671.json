This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Java split() not working as expected: :I currently have text where I have \"TweetJSONObject\\r\\n09/19/14TweetJSONObject\" where the TweetJSONObject is just a tweet in json format. Now I'm using the .split() function to try separate the tweets from one another but it would seem that \\r\\n09/19/14 isn't an appropriate split string? Here is the code:String[] value = line.split(\"\\r\\n09/19/14\");PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"hello.txt\", \"UTF-8\");writer.println(value[0]);writer.close();The text file 'hello', when I open it is just the following string again, \"TweetJSONObject\\r\\n09/19/14TweetJSONObject\". Any ideas as to where I'm going wrong?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
