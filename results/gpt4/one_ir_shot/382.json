The Iterator.remove() method is used to remove the current element from the collection. This is safer than removing an element from a collection while iterating over it with a for-each loop, which can cause a ConcurrentModificationException. The return statement is used to exit the method early once the item has been dropped or it has been determined that the room already has an item. If the method has not exited after the loop, it means the item was not found in the player's inventory, so the message is set to \"you do not have that item\"."

Update the game\u2019s message with one of the following options: 1) the player is not holding that item, 2) the room already has an item, or 3) the player has successfully dropped the item in the room.  This is the goal of this method but when I run it it always skipps to the currentMessage in the else statement.PROBLEM:The problem I am hacing is that when I run this method and try to drop an Item in a room, it doesnt and skips to the else statement and resturns the message \"you do not have that item\", and I do not know why it is doing this and not working through the first if statement because I am typing an items name I know is in the arraylist.public void drop(String name){          for(Item count : myArray){        if(count.getName().contains(name) && currentRoom.hasItem() == false){            currentRoom.addItem(count);            currentMessage = \"you have successfully dropped the item in the room\";            myArray.remove(count);        }        else if(count.getName().contains(name) && currentRoom.hasItem() == true)        {            currentMessage = \"the room already has an item\";        }        else         {            currentMessage = \"you do not have that item\";        }    }}\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
