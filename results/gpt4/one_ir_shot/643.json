If the key is not found, it returns null. In this case, we first retrieve the existing value (which is a string of file names) associated with the key 1. If the value exists, we append the new file name to the existing string and put it back into the HashMap with the same key. If the value does not exist, we simply put the new file name into the HashMap with the key 1. This way, we always have only one entry in the HashMap, and we modify the value associated with the key 1 every time."

It begins with \"1\" but when I find the word second time , the key increments and then the put method inserts a new entry with a new keyBut i would like to have only one entry and modify the key.Can this be done?How can i have only one object in a HashMap and modify the key every time?   DocsCollection.put(2,\"foo.txt,hello.txt\"); Thanks, in advance\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:"
