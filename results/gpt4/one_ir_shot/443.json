In this code, we initialize the min and max with the first element of the ArrayList. Then, we iterate through the ArrayList using the iterator. For each element, we compare it with the current min and max. If it's smaller than the current min, we update the min. If it's larger than the current max, we update the max. After the iteration, the min and max variables hold the minimum and maximum elements of the ArrayList. Note that the Entry class must implement the Comparable interface for this code to work."

The inferred type Entry is not a valid substitute for the bounded parameter <T extends Object & Comparable<? super T>>I also tried:test.length()so I could do a for loop. But it also failed with this kind of ArrayList.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
