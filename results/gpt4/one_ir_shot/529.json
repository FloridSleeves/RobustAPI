This new iterator starts from the beginning of the collection, so it always returns the first element. Instead, you should create one iterator and use it throughout the loop. The hasNext() method is used to check if there is a next element in the collection before calling next() to avoid NoSuchElementException."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Why does the Iterator not \"Move Next\" in a for loop: :I'm learning to iterate, and have implemented an Iterator on my 'CStickChart' Class using the following private property:  private List<CStick> cStickCollection = new ArrayList<CStick>();and then implementing the method to return CSticks:  public Iterator<CStick> iterator() {    return this.cStickCollection.iterator();  }Now when I try and iterate through it, I'm able to do so with the assigned localCStick but calling the next() method on the CStickChart Iterator doesn't do what I expected it to. I expected it to give me the next CStick in my CStickChart (hence when I call the getEPIC I was expecting it to give me the next EPIC along).// Print the EPIC out of the Array using the iteratorfor (CStick localCStick : testCStickChart) {  System.out.println(localCStick.getEPIC());  //The below line doesn't return the next CStick and I'm not sure why  System.out.println(\"next EPIC is \" + testCStickChart.iterator().next().getEPIC());}Please could someone explain why this is not the case (it always returns the first EPIC)\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
