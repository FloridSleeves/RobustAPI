I'm executing the EXE with Java using the following code:try {    pr = rt.exec(\"C:\\\\Users\\\\babesha.fm\\\\Desktop\\\\SUM.exe 10 5\");    int exitVal = pr.waitFor();    System.out.println(\"Exited with error code \" + exitVal);} catch (IOException e) {    // TODO Auto-generated catch block    e.printStackTrace();} catch (InterruptedException e) {    // TODO Auto-generated catch block    e.printStackTrace();}I used the return statement while creating the exe.But the problem is when I executed this exe by using the above java code. pr.waitFor(); statement returns the sum value instead of successful exicution.Did I done anything wrong .\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
