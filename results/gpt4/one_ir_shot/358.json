In Java, the Set interface is generic. It means you can specify the type of elements it can contain. If you don't specify a type, it can contain any type of elements. In your case, you should declare your Set with a type parameter like Set<Integer>. Then, you can use Iterator to traverse through the Set. The next() method of Iterator returns the next element in the iteration. If you don't specify a type for your Set, you need to cast the returned object to the correct type (Integer in this case)."
