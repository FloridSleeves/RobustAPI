The setContentView method is typically called in the onCreate method of an Activity. This is because before setContentView is called, the activity does not have a window for the user interface and thus cannot find any views. Therefore, you should initialize your CheckBox variables in the onCreate method after calling setContentView."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: I would like to set my variables at the top of my class instead of in the method: :I can't seem to tackle this confusing problem, I have lots and lots of things that I would like to add at the top of my class to help cut down on clutter.Since multiple methods use these checkbox variables.I would like to have everything at the top directly under the opening bracket.Here's what works, but not what I want.:public class MyClass extends Activity implements View.OnClickListener {    //leaving out most code like onCreate. Just pretend it's there.    public void checkboth(View view) {        CheckBox cb1 = (CheckBox) findViewById(R.id.cb1);        CheckBox cb2 = (CheckBox) findViewById(R.id.cb2);            cb1.setchecked(true);            cb2.setchecked(true);    }    @Override    public void onClick(View v) {    }}But for the life of me I can't figure out why I can't do this:public class MyClass extends Activity implements View.OnClickListener {CheckBox cb1 = (CheckBox) findViewById(R.id.cb1);CheckBox cb2 = (CheckBox) findViewById(R.id.cb2);    //leaving out most code like onCreate. Just pretend it's there.    public void checkboth(View view) {                    cb1.setchecked(true);        cb2.setchecked(true);    }    @Override    public void onClick(View v) {    }}\nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer:"
