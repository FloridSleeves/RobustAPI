This way, when the response is sent back to the client and the HTML is rendered, the JavaScript code block will be executed and the boardSize variable will be available for your JavaScript code to use."

I am working with NetBeans and tomcat as the server for testing. I have the GameSettings.html which the user choose the board size and press submit.  The data is being sent to servlet named: GameSettingsServlet.java  There I pull out the boardSize and parse it to an integer:  @Overrideprotected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)        throws ServletException, IOException {   createEngine(request);   processRequest(request, response);}private void createEngine(HttpServletRequest request){    int boardSize = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter(\"boardSize\"));    int numberOfPlayers = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter(\"numberOfPlayers\"));    m_Engine = new Engine(boardSize, numberOfPlayers );}I want to create the board with javaScript so I need to send the boardSize parameter to the   javaScript (which should run on BoardGame.html)  in order to know how much rows and columns to create.How can I pass the boardSize to the javaScript or HTML ?I searched on the web but I found only about JSP and I need it on HTML.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
