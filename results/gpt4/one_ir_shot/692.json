For each line in the file, we write it to a new file named \"output.txt\" using a PrintWriter. After writing each line, we also write two newline characters (\"\\n\\n\") to create double spacing. This is considered both reading (from \"input.txt\") and writing (to \"output.txt\"). The original file (\"input.txt\") is not modified, so we are not overwriting it. The PrintWriter.write method is used to write a string to the file. The FileWriter class can also be used to write to a file, but it is not a replacement for Scanner. Scanner is used for reading from a file, while FileWriter and PrintWriter are used for writing to a file."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Reading a File versus Writing One: :This question is not specific question, but more a general question. For reading a file I know you can use Scanner and read it and then print it. However reading a file and then printing it in a new format, like double space, indents, basically any spacing issues, is that also considered reading it or is it writing it? From my understanding of what my teacher has taught me, is that writing overwrites the original document and replaces it. Also how does one use the PrintWriter command? I have never seen this before in my class nor have read about it in my textbook but its on my test according to my teacher. Could someone give an explanation and an example about it? I read this site http://www.caveofprogramming.com/frontpage/articles/java/java-file-reading-and-writing-files-in-java/ on writing files, but it uses FileWriter, which I'm assuming takes the place of scanner? Is that right?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
