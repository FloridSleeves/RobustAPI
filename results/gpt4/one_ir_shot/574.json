This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: disposition header not working properly: :I am building a small image scaling tool where the user first uploads an image to a webpage and on submitting that form it shows a scaled up image for saving . But the problem arises when the user sends a request for the same image to be scaled with different width and height parameters. In this case the content dispostion header that I have set in the servlet doesn't seem to work and the image after the second request is sent with the class name of the servlet only instead of the filename and extension I have mentioned in the content disposition header.response.setContentType(\"image/jpeg\");response.setHeader(\"Content-disposition\",\"inline;filename=\"+filename);I also tried hardcoding it in the writer itself but the one that I am using doen't seem to have any parameter for filenameprivate void doDownload(HttpServletResponse resp, BufferedImage bump,            InputStream filecontent) throws IOException {        //http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9340569/jpeg-image-with-wrong-colors        OutputStream out = resp.getOutputStream();        Iterator<ImageWriter> iter = ImageIO                .getImageWritersByMIMEType(\"image/jpeg\");        ImageWriter writer = iter.next();        ImageWriteParam iwp = writer.getDefaultWriteParam();        iwp.setCompressionMode(ImageWriteParam.MODE_EXPLICIT);        iwp.setCompressionQuality(1);        ImageOutputStream imgOut = new MemoryCacheImageOutputStream(out);        writer.setOutput(imgOut);        IIOImage image = new IIOImage(bump, null, null);        writer.write(null, image, iwp);        out.flush();        out.close();        writer.dispose();    }Is there any way I can set the filename of the image while writing it to the outputstream?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
