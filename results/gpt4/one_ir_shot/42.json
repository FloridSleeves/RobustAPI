This will match any applications that can handle viewing any type of file. Then it queries the PackageManager for any activities that can handle the intent. The result is a list of ResolveInfo objects, each representing an application that can handle the intent. The code then loops through the list of ResolveInfo objects, calling loadLabel() on each one to get the user-visible label of the application, and adds these labels to an ArrayList."

If the file were an image I would do something like this normally to show all applications capable of viewing the image.Intent intent = new Intent();intent.setAction(android.content.Intent.ACTION_VIEW);intent.setDataAndType(Uri.fromFile(file), \"image/*\");context.startActivity(intent);However say I have an unknown file how could I list all applications able to view a file so the user can select the appropriate application to open the file in my application.I also need the titles listed in an arraylist if possible so I can list them in a listview. Thank you for any help with getting a list of applications capable of viewing a file===================================EditAlright well something easier how can i get the applications from the above intent into an arraylist i could just do image/* audio/* etc and add them all to a list and then list them in a listview and that would solve my problem\nPlease using this api: ApplicationInfo.loadIcon.\nAnswer:"
