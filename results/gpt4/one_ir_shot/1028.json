The nextToken() method returns the next token from this string tokenizer's string. In the given code, we are tokenizing the input string with \"+-*\" as delimiters. We are also passing 'true' to the StringTokenizer constructor to return the delimiters as tokens. Then we are iterating over the tokens and adding them to the appropriate list based on whether they are a delimiter or not. To get the delimiter corresponding to a token at index 'i', we simply get the element at index 'i' from the delimiterList."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Using the same indices between two arrays to get relevant information?: :I have a data reader that tokenizes input strings by given delimiters. The tokens go to an ArrayList, and the delimiters go to another. For example:this + is - an * inputThis sentence would be tokenized so that \"this\", \"is\", \"an\" and \"input\" would go to the token array while \"+\", \"-\" and \"*\" go to the delimiters array. Now, I need to store the original indices of these as well, so that the tokens would have indices 0, 2, 4 and 6 and the deliminators would have indices 1, 3 and 5. The normal solution would be to put them into the same array, but I need to keep them separated for performance reasons (e.g. to quickly check through the delimiters).How could this indexing be done so that when I have a token index 'i', I could easily get the deliminator from index 'i+1' without looping through all the delimiters?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
