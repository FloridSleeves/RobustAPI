We can use the next() method to get the next element in the collection and the remove() method to remove the last element returned by the iterator. This way, we can remove k elements from the map without explicitly iterating over it."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Can you efficiently remove any k elements from a map without iterating?: :I have a map I've populated (say it's a HashMap). I want it cut down to size... I don't care which elements I remove, I just want k of the elements removed.What's the most efficient way to do this (other than iterating)?Edit: k is not known in advance. Suggestions to based on other kinds of maps are relevant.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
