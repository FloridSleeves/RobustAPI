By using \"\\r\\n\", you are ensuring that a new line is started, regardless of the underlying operating system. This is because \"\\r\\n\" is the newline character sequence used in Windows. Also, don't forget to close the PrintWriter after you're done with it to ensure that all changes are written to the file."
