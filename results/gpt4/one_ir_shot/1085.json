In this case, we are using it to break the CSS string into tokens based on the \"{\" and \"}\" characters. We then loop through the tokens, and for each pair of tokens (which represent the id and style respectively), we replace the id in the HTML string with the id and the inline style. This effectively inlines the CSS with the HTML. However, this is a very basic example and may not work for more complex CSS and HTML. For a more robust solution, you may want to consider using a library like jsoup or jStyleParser."

I seem to fail to understand if it can do the job of inlining the CSS on the elements from the HTML. The documentation and examples is not what I expected.Is there anyone who can answer that question or does there exist another library for this?Thanks\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
