Each ProcessBuilder instance manages a collection of process attributes. The start() method creates a new Process instance. The command() method sets this process builder's operating system program and arguments. The directory() method sets this process builder's working directory. The InputStream.read() method reads the next byte of data from the input stream. The BufferedReader.readLine() method reads a line of text. A line is considered to be terminated by any one of a line feed ('\\n'), a carriage return ('\\r'), or a carriage return followed immediately by a linefeed."

Normally I cd to Desktop/GIT/ and use this maven command \"mvn integration-test -DskipTests -P interactive -e\".I am building a java program and I am trying to run that command line but so far I wasn't successful. So far, here is the code:public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException {// TODO Auto-generated method stub Process theProcess = null;try  {      theProcess = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(\"mvn integration-test -DskipTests -P interactive -e\");  } catch(IOException e)  {     System.err.println(\"Error on exec() method\");     e.printStackTrace();    }// read from the called program's standard output stream  try  {     inStream = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader( theProcess.getInputStream()));       System.out.println(inStream.readLine());  }  catch(IOException e)  {     System.err.println(\"Error on inStream.readLine()\");     e.printStackTrace();    }break;    }}in.close();}\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
