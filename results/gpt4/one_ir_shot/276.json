In the context of an Iterator, this error might occur if you are trying to access the next element of the iterator when there is no next element. The hasNext() method of Iterator should be used to check if there is a next element before calling next(). If hasNext() returns false and you still call next(), it will throw a NoSuchElementException."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Java.lang.AssertionError in a SortedArrayList: :So I'm making an Contact Manager App in Android. My professor send us a JUnit test so we can know if our code is working correctly. Now every method has passed the test except the iterator test which fails the test. It appears to be a java.lang.AssertionError and I cant seem to figure out a way of fixing it. If you could see the error and point it out to me would be awesome. Thanks in advance\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
