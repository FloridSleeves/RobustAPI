It first creates a FileItemFactory and a ServletFileUpload. It then parses the request to get a list of FileItems. For each FileItem, if it is not a form field (i.e., it is a file), it gets the file name and extension, creates a new File object with the upload path and file name, and writes the contents of the file to the new file using a PrintWriter. The input stream from the FileItem is read and each byte is written to the file."

I am stuck trying to figure out how to get the file extension of the uploaded file, how to write the file to a directory and the worst part is where the person who wrote the example comments // Process the input stream... It leaves me wondering if it's something so trivial that I'm the only one  who doesn't know how to. \nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
