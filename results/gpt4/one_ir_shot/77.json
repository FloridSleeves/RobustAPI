This allows us to know exactly how many bytes to read for each array when we read the file. When reading the file, we read the length of the next array, create a new byte array of that length, and then read the bytes into the array. This process is repeated until there are no more bytes available in the file."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Write and read multiple byte[] in file with Java: :I have to write byte arrays in a file. I can't do it in one time so I can't put my arrays in a container. Also the size of my arrays is variable.Secondly, the file is very huge, so I have to split it, in order to read it array by array.How can I do that ? I tried to write line by line my byte arrays  but I haven't been able. How can I put a separator between my arrays and after split it over this separator ?EDIT : I tried this :ByteArrayOutputStream bos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();ObjectOutput out = new ObjectOutputStream(bos);out.writeObject(byteArray);But, I execute this code several times, so the ObjectOutputStream adds each time a new header which corrupt the file.I also try : out.write(byteArray);but I couldn't separate my arrays. So I tried to append a '\\n', which didn't work. After I was looking for library like FileUtils in order to write byte[] line by line but I didn't find.\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:"
