The iterator cycles through the elements of the polygon (vertices and edges) in an infinite loop. The next() method of the Iterator interface returns the next element in the iteration. If the iteration has no more elements, it starts from the beginning. This allows us to use the for-each loop with the Polygon class."

Is this correct? Or is there a way I could use for-each with both?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
