The Authorization header is used to send credentials in an HTTP request, and it typically contains a token that is Base64 encoded. The StringTokenizer.nextToken API is used to split the Authorization header into its constituent parts, which are then decoded and checked against the credentials stored in your database. If the credentials match, the request is authenticated. Otherwise, an AuthenticationException is thrown."
