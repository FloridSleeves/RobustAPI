It has a constructor that takes an Iterator of Item objects. The hasNext() method just delegates the call to the underlying iterator. The next() method, however, wraps the Item object returned by the delegate's next() method into a FacadeItem object before returning it. This way, the iterator iterates over FacadeItem objects instead of Item objects."
