The input string is split into words using the split method of the String class. Then, for each word, a switch statement is used to determine the corresponding number. If the word is a number from one to nine, the result is multiplied by 10 and the number is added. If the word is \"zero\", the result is multiplied by 10. If the word is \"hundred\", the result is multiplied by 100. If the word is not recognized, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown."

Improve this question                    I want to convert words containing alphabetical characters into a representative number in Java.  For example, four hundred four should evaluate to the number 404.If the letters are gibberish like asdf then that's an error.I know I can convert bare Characters to their ascii equivalent Integer, appending those together, but I only want the numbers behind the English word phrases extracted.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
