This method blocks until all requested bytes are read, the end of the stream is detected, or an exception is thrown. The file pointer is then advanced by the number of bytes successfully read. This means that when you call readFully() the second time, it starts reading from where it left off after the first call, hence why it doesn't give the same value. The size of the byte arrays (15 in this case) is determined based on the expected length of the strings to be read. If the actual string is shorter, the remaining bytes will be filled with zeros. If it's longer, the string will be cut off."
