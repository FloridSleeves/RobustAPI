This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Going back to the first index after reaching the last one in an array: :After my array in the for loop reaches the last index, I get an exception saying that the index is out of bounds. What I wanted is for it to go back to the first index until z is equal to ctr. How can I do that?My code:char res;int ctr = 10char[] flames = {'F','L','A','M','E','S'};for(int z = 0; z < ctr-1; z++){    res = (flames[z]);    jLabel1.setText(String.valueOf(res));}\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
