In this case, we are breaking each line into tokens using the semicolon as a delimiter. The nextToken() method is used to return the next token from the string. If the token matches the id we are looking for, we store the line in the result and break the loop. If the result is not empty after going through all the lines, we have found the line with the id and break the outer loop."

Achieved by doing the fallowing.List<String> listlist.add(line);What I am trying to do is see if some Id such as \"0x0640e331\" is in the list. And if it is get everything on the line of text that that Id is found. So the fallowing would happen,0x0604f552;name0;function0x0640e331;name1;function0x0342t521;name2;functionSearching for 0x0640e331 would return, 0x0640e331;name1;function.Any ideas?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
