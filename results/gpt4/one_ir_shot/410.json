However, you can iterate over the entries in the map using an Iterator. The next() method of the Iterator interface returns the next element in the iteration. You can use this to effectively \"rotate\" through the entries in the map."

I have this working, and now I'm looking at expanding it to hold results. At the moment I read all the teams into a list. and use Collections.rotate to rotate the list in order to randomize the fixtures.I was thinking of using a Map to hold the team and number of wins, however rotate doesn't appear to work for map. Is there a similar function that I'm missing, or something that I have overlooked?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
