This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: How to Clear a text file without deleting it?: :I am wondering what the best way to clear a file is. I know that java automatically creates a file with f = new Formatter(\"jibberish.txt\");  s = new Scanner(\"jibberish.txt\");if none already exists. But what if one exists and I want to clear it every time I run the program? That is what I am wondering: to say it again how do I clear a file that already exists to just be blank? Here is what I was thinking: public void clearFile(){    //go through and do this every time in order to delete previous crap    while(s.hasNext()){        f.format(\" \");    }} \nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
