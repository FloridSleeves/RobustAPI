This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Sort Map by Top Scores: :I have a map that stores a players name and there score on which i update and things fine.public static Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<String, Integer>();After the first round of my game finishes i want to remove the lowest scores from the map. For instance, There could be 8 players in the map 4 of whom have a score of 10 and the other 4 have a score of 0 how would i split the map in half based on the top scorers and remove the bottom 4? Keep in mind the 8 players is not defined, it could be any number\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
