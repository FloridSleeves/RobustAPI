The `next` method applies the function to the current value and updates the current value with the result. The `map` method returns a new `LazySequence` with the same current value but a new function that is the composition of the old function and the new function. The `hasNext` method always returns true because a `LazySequence` is infinite."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Function composition in Java: :I'm trying to implement a lazy sequence (meaning that the next item is only calculated when you invoke the step function), and one of the methods it should have is \"map\" which receives a function that affects all the members.The most elegant way to do this is to use function composition, and assign the new function to the function variable, but since functions are not first class values in Java I have no idea how to do this.I thought about having a class that only contains a function, as a sort of \"function pointer\" wrapper, but I don't see how that can be used for composition.Edit: question is homework related.Also, it should be able to handle multiple compositions along the lines of map(map(map(stepFunction()))) (\"map\" in this case being the function given through the method \"map\").\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
