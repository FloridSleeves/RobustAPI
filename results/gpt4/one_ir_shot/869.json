You can replace or overwrite parts of a file without rewriting the whole file. In this code, we are reading 10KB of data at a time from the file, then writing our data to the same location. The seek() method is used to move the file pointer to a specific location, and the write() method is used to write data from the beginning of the byte array to the file."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Update data to file each amount of bytes: :I want to write my content data to a file each 10kb of file. It looks like this: What I tried: FileInputStream is; FileOutputStream out; File input = new File(filePath); int fileLength = input.length(); int len = 0;    while (len < fileLength){        len += is.read(buff);        // write my data        out.write(data, 0, data.length);       // how to move is to read next 10kb???    }I wonder is there anyway to move the cursor reader to next amount of bytes? Or do I miss anything?Update:Thank to @DThought, here is my implementation:    File input = new File(filePath);    long fileLength = input.length();    byte[] data;    byte[] buff = new byte[data.length];    long JUMP_LENGTH = 10 * 1024;    RandomAccessFile raf = new RandomAccessFile(input, \"rw\");    long step = JUMP_LENGTH + data.length;    for (long i = 0; i < fileLength; i += step) {        // read to buffer        raf.seek(i);        raf.read(buff);        raf.seek(i); // make sure it move to correct place after reading        raf.write(data);    }    raf.close();And it worked well.\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.write.\nAnswer:"
