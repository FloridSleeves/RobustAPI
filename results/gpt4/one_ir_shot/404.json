You can get iterator instance from a Collection using the iterator() method. The hasNext() method returns true if the iteration has more elements. The next() method returns the next element in the iteration. It can be called only if hasNext() returns true. So, you can traverse through the collection without accessing the elements by just calling the next() method inside the while loop without using its return value."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Is there a conventional iterator interface in Java which separates traversal from element access?: :For my application, element access is expensive, so java.util.Iterator is no use.  I want something more like C++ iterators, where I can move the pointer around without returning an element.  Is there something in the standard library like this, or has some de facto standard interface evolved through custom?  (If not, please don't waste your time posting code snippets - I'm quite able to think up reasonable names which will do the job).  \nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
