However, you can create your own serializer by implementing the JsonSerializer interface. In the serialize method, you convert the DateTime object to a string using the toString method and return it as a JsonPrimitive. You then register this serializer with the GsonBuilder when creating a new Gson instance."

This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Is there a standard implementation for a GSON Joda Time serialiser?: :I'm using GSON to serialise some object graphs to JSON.  These objects graphs use Joda Time entities (DateTime, LocalTime etc).The top Google hit for \"gson joda\" is this page:https://sites.google.com/site/gson/gson-type-adapters-for-common-classesIt provides source for a type adapter for org.joda.time.DateTime.  This link is also what is referenced in the GSON User Guide.I expected to find a pre-rolled library that included joda-time serialisers that I could reference as a Maven dependency - but I can't find one.  Is there one?  Or am I forced to replicate that snippet in my own project?\nPlease using this api: JsonElement.getAsString.\nAnswer:"
