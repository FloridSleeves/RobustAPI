The ObjectOutputStream.writeObject() method writes an object to the output stream. This way, you can switch between sending text commands and objects without having to close and reopen the socket. However, please note that the receiver should be aware of this protocol and read the data in the same order."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Can I change the type of stream I'm using without closing and reopening the socket in Java?: :I'm doing some socket programming in Java and I'd like to be able to change between using the ObjectOutputStream, the DataOutputStream, and the PrintWriter all within the same socket/connection.  Is this possible and what is the best way to do it?I've tried just creating both types of objects, for example ObjectOutputStream and DataOutputStream, but that doesn't seem to work.The reason I want to switch between them is to, for example, send a text command \"INFO\" that signals I'm about to send an object with information or a command \"DATA\" signalling that I'm about to send data.  Any advice on the best way to do this is appreciated.\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:"
