It uses an Iterator to traverse the original list. In each iteration of the while loop, a new list is created and elements from the original list are added to it using the next() method of the Iterator. This continues until there are no more elements in the original list or the size of the new list reaches the specified size. The new list is then added to the list of lists. This process repeats until there are no more elements in the original list."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Efficient way to divide a list into lists of n size: :I have an ArrayList, which I want to divide into smaller List objects of n size, and perform an operation on each.My current method of doing this is implemented with ArrayList objects in Java. Any pseudocode will do.    for (int i = 1; i <= Math.floor((A.size() / n)); i++) {            ArrayList temp = subArray(A, ((i * n) - n),                    (i * n) - 1);            // do stuff with temp        }    private ArrayList<Comparable> subArray(ArrayList A, int start,                int end) {            ArrayList toReturn = new ArrayList();            for (int i = start; i <= end; i++) {                toReturn.add(A.get(i));            }            return toReturn;        }where A is the list and n is the size of the desired listsI believe this way is taking too much time when working with considerably large lists of up to 1 million in size, so I'm trying to figure out what would be more efficient.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
