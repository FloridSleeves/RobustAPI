Then, we create a RelativeLayout to act as a container for both the custom canvas and the AdView. We add the canvas to the layout, then create layout parameters for the AdView to position it at the bottom center of the screen. We add the AdView to the layout with these parameters, then set the content view of the Activity to our layout. Finally, we load an ad into the AdView."
