If no exception is thrown, the counter written is incremented by the number of bytes actually written. In this case, the write method is used to send a handshake message to the Minecraft server. The message is first converted to a byte array, then written to the output stream. The output stream is then flushed, which forces any buffered output bytes to be written out to the stream. If the server responds with a byte value of 0x02, the handshake is considered successful. If not, or if an EOFException is thrown, the handshake is considered to have failed."

I have never really worked with networking too much, so the issue is figuring out how to send packets correctly. I am currently at the position of creating the handshake with the server. After hours of research, I have come up with the following code, but it always runs into the \"Failed! (Exception)\" message. To me, everything looks correct, but for all I know it could be 100% wrong. If someone could point out what I'm doing wrong here, I'd really appreciate it.For reference, feel free to use this and this.public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {    host = new InetSocketAddress(\"162.244.165.111\", 48040);    socket = new Socket();    System.out.println(\"Connecting...\");    socket.connect(host, 3000);    System.out.println(\"Done!\");    System.out.println(\"Making streams...\");    output = new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());    input = new DataInputStream(socket.getInputStream());    System.out.println(\"Done!\");    System.out.println(\"Attempting handshake... \"+host.getAddress().toString().substring(1));    byte[] msg = (\"47;\"+host.getAddress().toString().substring(1)+\";\"+host.getPort()+\";2;\").getBytes(Charset.forName(\"UTF-16\"));    output.writeInt(msg.length+Integer.valueOf(0x00));    output.writeByte(0x00);    output.write(msg);    output.flush();    try {        if (input.readByte() != 0x02)            System.out.println(\"Failed!\");        else            System.out.println(\"Done!\");    } catch (EOFException e) {        System.out.println(\"Failed!
