It reads bytes from the specified byte-array starting from the offset till the length of the array. In this case, we are reading the first byte into the 'version' array and the next three bytes into the 'recordLength' array. The 'version' and 'recordLength' are byte arrays because the data is binary."

Im familiar with basic TCP sockets but want to know how to translate requirements into code.Example: Format for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Common Log Format (CLF)Would like to see how to translate: 0          7 8        15 16       23 24         31  +-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+  |  Version  |           Record Length           | 0 - 3  +-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+   Version (1 byte):  0x41 for this document; hexadecimal encoded.   Record Length (6 bytes):  Hexadecimal encoded total length of this  log record, including \"Flags\" and \"Record Length\" fields, and  terminating line-feed.into code.How can I define Version?Which type?Int, char, etc?Thanks\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
