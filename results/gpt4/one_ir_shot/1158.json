The nextToken() method of StringTokenizer class is used to return the next token from the StringTokenizer object. In the given code, we first create a StringTokenizer object with the string \"John 20150.00\". Then we use the nextToken() method to get the first token (the name) and the second token (the number). The Double.parseDouble() method is used to convert the second token from String to double."

This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Converting string with letters and numbers: :So I have a String declared as String name = \"John 20150.00\" and I want to break up the name into a different variable and the number into a different variable, is this possible? I tried using the Double.parseDouble(name); method, but when it runs, it doesn't work right. What should I use?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
