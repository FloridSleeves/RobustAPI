In this case, we are using it to access a node in the ArrayList in O(1) time. We then adjust the previous and next pointers of the node and its neighbors to remove it from its current position, and add it to the end of the list. This allows us to move a node to the end of the list in constant time."

I know that if i traverse the list to find a certain node it would take O(n) time so I want to map the nodes to an array list where I can access the nodes in O(1) time.I'm really unsure how I would do this mapping. I would like to see an example of how this can be done.Edit:I would like to be able to access any node in the linked list so I can move the nodes around in O(1) time.Example: Move node with ID 5 to end of list in O(1) time. Edit 2: I uploaded a picture example of what I'm trying to accomplish\nPlease using this api: List.get.\nAnswer:"
