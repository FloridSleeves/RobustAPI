It then iterates over every pixel in the image, getting the RGB value of each pixel and storing it in a HashMap. The RGB value is used as the key, and the count of each color is the value. The Collections.max() method is used to find the entry with the highest count, and the RGB value of the most common color is retrieved. Finally, a Color object is created from the most common RGB value."
