If an object with the same key is already in the map, it is not added. This way, only the first object with each key is kept. The values of the map (the objects) are then returned as a new list. The Iterator.next API is not directly used in this solution, but it is implicitly used in the for-each loop to iterate over the list."

In code:private void example() {    List<SomeType> listWithDuplicates = new ArrayList<SomeType>();    /*     * create the \"duplicate\" objects. Note that both attributes passed to      * the constructor are used in equals(), though for the purpose of this      * question they are considered equal if the first argument was equal     */    SomeType someObject1 = new SomeObject1(\"hello\", \"1\");    SomeType someObject2 = new SomeObject1(\"hello\", \"2\");    List<SomeType> listWithoutDuplicates = removeDuplicates(listWithDuplicates)    //listWithoutDuplicates should not contain someObject2}private List<SomeType> removeDuplicates(List<SomeType> listWithDuplicates) {    /*     * remove all but the first entry in the list where the first constructor-     * arg was the same     */}\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
