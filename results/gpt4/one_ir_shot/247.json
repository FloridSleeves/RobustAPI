The number of bytes actually read is returned as an integer. This method blocks until input data is available, the end of the stream is detected, or an exception is thrown. In this case, we first read 4 bytes to get the integer, then we read the length of the string and then the string itself. We repeat this for all three strings. The readString() method is a helper method to read the strings from the DataInputStream."

Now I am programming in Java (for Android, and I'm new in Java), and I have to access the data which were previously written to a file using C#. I tried using DataInputStream.readInt() and DataInputStream.readUTF(), but I can't get proper results. I usually get a UTFDataFormatException: java.io.UTFDataFormatException: malformed input around byte 21or the String and int I get is wrong...FileInputStream fs = new FileInputStream(strFilePath);DataInputStream ds = new DataInputStream(fs);int i;String str1,str2,str3;i=ds.readInt();str1=ds.readUTF();str2=ds.readUTF();str3=ds.readUTF();ds.close();What is the proper way of doing this?   \nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
