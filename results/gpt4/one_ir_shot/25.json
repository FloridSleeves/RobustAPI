Then, you find your button by its ID. After that, you check if the CALL_PHONE permission is granted. If it's not granted (which would be the case on a tablet without calling functionality), you disable the button using setEnabled(false) and change its text to \"Call function not available\" using setText(). This way, the button will be disabled and its text changed when the app is first opened on a device without calling functionality."

This simple app would just contain a button that would use the call intent to call a specific number. I would like to install this app on both tablets and phone but when it is installed on the tablet, I would like the button to be disabled during runtime so errors wouldn't show when the user tries to call using the tablet without a call function. At the moment, I am using the setEnabled() and setClickable() method in my MainActivity.java and setting it to false when the user clicks on the button the first time. My question is whether the button can be disabled and the text changed during runtime or when the app is first opened (in a tablet) so the user wouldn't have to click the button first for it to show that the \"call\" button should be disabled and unclickable?\nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer:"
