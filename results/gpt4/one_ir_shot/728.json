The FileWriter class is a subclass of OutputStreamWriter and translates characters into bytes using the platform's default charset. The 'true' parameter in the FileWriter constructor enables the append mode, which means that data will be written to the end of the file rather than the beginning. The write() method of PrintWriter writes the specified string to the PrintWriter. After writing all the lines, the PrintWriter is closed using the close() method."
