When it encounters the sequence '\u00d0' followed by '\u00cf', it sets the start flag to true. From that point on, it writes every byte it encounters to the output file. The write method of the DataOutputStream class writes the specified byte (the low eight bits) to the underlying output stream. If no exception is thrown, the counter written is incremented by 1."

Please advise how can I perform this .\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:"
