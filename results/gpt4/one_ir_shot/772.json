So far, there haven't been any errors with accessing it. However, when I close the program or after when the files should have been written when I open the text file I don't find them there, however I did check the bin folder ocne and it seemed to print hello world to the temp copy there. I want the changes it makes to be permanent.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
