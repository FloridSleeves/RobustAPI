In this case, we are using the quote character (\") as the delimiter to break the string into tokens. The nextToken() method is used to get the next token from the string. The hasMoreTokens() method is used to check if there are more tokens available in the string. The tokens (words between quotes) are then added to a list."

The result should be:  comillasmas, comillas, tricka, words, are, comillas  \nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
