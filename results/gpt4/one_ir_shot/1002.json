Both Java and C# are correctly converting the string to a byte array using UTF-8 encoding. The difference is likely due to the implementation of the HmacSHA256 algorithm in Java and C#. Even though they are supposed to be the same algorithm, the underlying libraries may handle the data differently, leading to different results. It's also possible that the data being hashed is not exactly the same in both cases."

Can anyone see why?\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:"
