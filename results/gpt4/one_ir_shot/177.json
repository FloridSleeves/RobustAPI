It returns the total number of bytes read into the buffer, or -1 if there is no more data. In this case, we're reading from a binary file, and processing each byte as needed. To replicate the padding that a C compiler would add, you might need to add extra bytes at certain positions. This would depend on the specific padding rules of the C compiler you're trying to replicate."

This is a special case of a reduction. This is a terminal operation.\nQuestion: Replicating C struct padding in Java: :According to here, the C compiler will pad out values when writing a structure to a binary file. As the example in the link says, when writing a struct like this:struct { char c; int i;} a;to a binary file, the compiler will usually leave an unnamed, unused hole between the char and int fields, to ensure that the int field is properly aligned. How could I to create an exact replica of the binary output file (generated in C), using a different language (in my case, Java)?Is there an automatic way to apply C padding in Java output? Or do I have to go through compiler documentation to see how it works (the compiler is g++ by the way).\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
