The InputStream.read method is used to read the output from the SSH session. The read method blocks until input data is available, the end of the stream is detected, or an exception is thrown. The method reads up to len bytes of data from the input stream into an array of bytes. An attempt is made to read as many as len bytes, but a smaller number may be read. The number of bytes actually read is returned as an integer."
