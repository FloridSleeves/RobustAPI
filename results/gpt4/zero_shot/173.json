It returns -1 if the end of the stream is reached. In your case, you can use it to read the data from the socket's input stream. The read data is appended to a StringBuilder object. The loop continues until there is no more data to read (i.e., until read() returns -1). If a SocketException occurs during the reading process, it is caught and an error message is printed. After all data has been read, \"done\" is printed to the console."

No obvious errors (I think): :This is my main class - Main.java. Used to control requester but added for completeness.import java.io.IOException;import HtmlRequester.Requester;public class Main {public static void main(String[] args) {    Requester rq = new Requester(\"www.google.co.za\", 80);    try {        rq.htmlRequest();    } catch (IOException e) {        e.printStackTrace();        System.err.println(\"Connection failed.\");        System.exit(-1);    }}}This is requester.java, edited for shortness.package HtmlRequester;import java.net.*;import java.io.*;public class Requester{    Socket httpSocket = null;    PrintWriter out = null;    BufferedReader in = null;    String server;    int port;public void setAttributes(String server, int port){    this.server = server;    this.port = port;}public String htmlRequest(String server, int port) throws IOException{    try {        httpSocket = new Socket(InetAddress.getByName(server), port);        out = new PrintWriter(httpSocket.getOutputStream(), true);        in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(                httpSocket.getInputStream()));    } catch (UnknownHostException e) {        System.err.println(\"Don't know about host: \" + server);        System.exit(-1);    } catch (IOException e) {        System.err.println(\"Couldn't get I/O for \"                           + \"the connection to: \" + server + \"on port \" + port);        System.exit(-1);    }    finally{        System.out.println(\"Successful connection.\");    }    out.println(compileRequestText());    out.println(\"\");    String t;    String ret = \"\";    System.out.println(\"wait...\");    try {        while((t = in.readLine()) != null)        {        ret.concat(t);        System.out.println(t);        }        System.out.println(\"done\");    }    catch(SocketException e)    {        System.err.println(\"Socket Exception :(\");    }    System.out.println(\"Succesful data transfer.\");    out.close();    in.close();    httpSocket.close();    return ret;}private String compileRequestText(){    String ret = \"GET / HTTP/1.1\";    return ret;}}What happens is that the second try-catch block in Request.java, the block that contains:while((t = in.readLine()) != null)Will execute, and the response from server is successfully displayed. However, after the response is displayed, the loop will stop executing, the code does not move ahead to the finally block. The program does not seem to continue after that while loop. Anyone have any idea why?i.e.,             System.out.println(\"done\");is never reached, with no exceptions or compiler errors being thrown.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
