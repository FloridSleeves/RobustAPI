In this case, it is used to get the next `ImageWriter` object from the `ImageIO.getImageWritersByMIMEType(\"image/jpeg\")` method, which returns an iterator of `ImageWriter` objects that can write images of the specified MIME type. The `ImageWriter` object is then used to write the image to the output stream.\n\nAs for setting the filename of the image while writing it to the output stream, the filename is typically determined by the client, not the server. The server can suggest a filename using the `Content-Disposition` header, but it's ultimately up to the client to decide what filename to use when saving the file. If the `Content-Disposition` header is not working as expected, it could be due to a variety of reasons, such as the client not supporting the `Content-Disposition` header, or the filename containing special characters that need to be URL-encoded."

But the problem arises when the user sends a request for the same image to be scaled with different width and height parameters. In this case the content dispostion header that I have set in the servlet doesn't seem to work and the image after the second request is sent with the class name of the servlet only instead of the filename and extension I have mentioned in the content disposition header.response.setContentType(\"image/jpeg\");response.setHeader(\"Content-disposition\",\"inline;filename=\"+filename);I also tried hardcoding it in the writer itself but the one that I am using doen't seem to have any parameter for filenameprivate void doDownload(HttpServletResponse resp, BufferedImage bump,            InputStream filecontent) throws IOException {        //http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9340569/jpeg-image-with-wrong-colors        OutputStream out = resp.getOutputStream();        Iterator<ImageWriter> iter = ImageIO                .getImageWritersByMIMEType(\"image/jpeg\");        ImageWriter writer = iter.next();        ImageWriteParam iwp = writer.getDefaultWriteParam();        iwp.setCompressionMode(ImageWriteParam.MODE_EXPLICIT);        iwp.setCompressionQuality(1);        ImageOutputStream imgOut = new MemoryCacheImageOutputStream(out);        writer.setOutput(imgOut);        IIOImage image = new IIOImage(bump, null, null);        writer.write(null, image, iwp);        out.flush();        out.close();        writer.dispose();    }Is there any way I can set the filename of the image while writing it to the outputstream?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
