In this case, we are querying the \"clients\" and \"order\" tables separately. The selection argument is used to specify the WHERE clause of the SQL statement, in this case, we are selecting rows where the id equals 2. The selectionArgs argument is used to replace the \"?\" placeholders in the selection argument. The query returns a Cursor object, which can be used to navigate through the returned rows. In the while loop, we use the Cursor's moveToNext method to move to the next row, and the getString and getColumnIndex methods to retrieve the data from the columns."
