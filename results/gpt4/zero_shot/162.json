In this case, we are using a ByteArrayOutputStream to store the data read from the InputStream. We then convert this ByteArrayOutputStream to a byte array. \n\nNow, we can create a new ByteArrayInputStream for each use from the byte array. This way, we can use the same data multiple times without the original InputStream being closed. \n\nThis approach is suitable when you want to keep the file in memory for faster access and less IO problems when dealing with files, as you mentioned in your question. However, please note that this approach will consume more memory as the entire file is stored in memory."

Also is it better to just read up the input stream into an array or string and then create input streams for each use ?EDIT 2:Sorry to reopen the question, but the conditions are somewhat different when working inside desktop and web application. First of all, the InputStream i get from the org.apache.commons.fileupload.FileItem in my tomcat web app doesn't support markings thus cannot reset. Second, I'd like to be able to keep the file in memory for faster acces and less io problems when dealing with files.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
