We first create a FileOutputStream for the file we want to write to, and then get a FileChannel from this stream. We then create a ByteBuffer with a size of 1024 bytes, which will be our buffer for writing data. We clear the buffer, put the data we want to write into it, and then flip the buffer so it's ready for writing. We then write the contents of the buffer to the file using the FileChannel.write method in a while loop, which continues until there is no more data left in the buffer. After writing, we close the FileChannel and the FileOutputStream. This method of writing is faster than using FileWriter because it writes data in bulk, reducing disk I/O operations."

Currently, I am using File Writer class. However, it is too slow. Can anybody help me how to perform bulk write in Java like maintaining a large buffer and periodically flush it.\nPlease using this api: FileChannel.write.\nAnswer:"
