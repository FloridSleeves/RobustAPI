We then create a BufferedReader object to read from the file \"input.txt\". We read each line of the file using the readLine() method in a while loop. Inside the loop, we print the line to the console and then create a PrintWriter object to write to the file \"output.txt\". We use the write() method of the PrintWriter class to write the line to the file. After writing, we close the PrintWriter using the close() method. We also close the BufferedReader after reading all lines from the file. If any IOException occurs during this process, we catch it and print the stack trace."
