It then sets the request method to POST and enables output for the connection. The user data is then written to the output stream of the connection using the `PrintWriter.write` method. If the response code from the server is 200, indicating a successful request, the code then reads the input stream from the connection and writes it to a file named \"downloaded.csv\". The buffer is used to read the data in chunks of 1024 bytes at a time. The `InputStream.read` method returns -1 when there is no more data to read, at which point the loop ends. The input and output streams are then closed to free up system resources."

I've tried logging in using Internet Explorer and download using that session but it didn't work. So I'm guessing I need to POST user data to the web, get an answer and download the file.How can I create a session wtih Java and download the file? Thank you in advance.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
