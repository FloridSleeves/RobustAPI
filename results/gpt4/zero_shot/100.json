First, we create a DataOutputStream object 'dos' from the socket's OutputStream. Then, we write the length of the buffer plus one to the stream using the writeInt method. This is followed by writing a zero byte using the writeByte method. Finally, we write the buffer to the stream using the write method and flush the stream using the flush method. This ensures that all the data is sent immediately and not buffered."

(Android)I'm having trouble with the following implementation:Server grabs bitmap -> raw bytes -> TCP -> Client (Async StreamsNow the byte array is delivered in multiple packets of different lengths in the client. So to handle this properly, I should use the prefix method.To use prefix mode you need to send the length of the message in bytes  as four bytes and then the messageMy codepublic void sendScreenshot(byte[] buffer) throws IOException {    OutputStream os = socket.getOutputStream();    os.write(buffer.length + 1);    os.write((byte) 0);    os.write(buffer, 0, buffer.length);    os.flush();}In VB.net, this is achieved in the following code:Private Sub dat(ByVal dat As String)    Dim nstream As NetworkStream = sock.GetStream()    Dim bit As Byte() = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(dat)    Dim bw As New BinaryWriter(sock.GetStream())    bw.Write(bit.Length + 1)    bw.Write((byte)command)    bw.Write(bit, 0, bit.length)End SubAny help implementing it in Java is welcome?\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:"
