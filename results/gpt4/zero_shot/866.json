First, we create a `RandomAccessFile` object and open the file in \"rw\" mode, which stands for \"read and write\". Then, we get the current length of the file using the `length` method, which gives us the number of bytes in the file. We use the `seek` method to move the file pointer to the end of the file. Finally, we use the `write` method to append the encrypted data to the file. If an `IOException` occurs during this process, it is caught and the stack trace is printed. \n\nRegarding your question about using 'NoPadding', it is possible to use 'NoPadding' if you ensure that the output data size is divisible by the block size. However, you should be aware that this could potentially make your encryption less secure, as it could make it easier for an attacker to guess the plaintext."

Unfortunately, cryptography is not my strong side. Now I can write to file several messages and then close file. Then i can open it, append some messages, close again and after decryption I see padding bytes in the middle of file. Is there any way to work with encrypted file without having to decrypt it every time I want to append some messages?EDIT: little more details. Current implementation utlizes CipherOutputStream. As i understand there's no way to seek using it.Can i use 'NoPadding' option if i will control that output data size is divisible by block size?\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.write.\nAnswer:"
