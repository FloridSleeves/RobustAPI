It can be stored in any type of file or even in memory. In this example, the compiled code is written to a text file named \"output.txt\" using the PrintWriter.write API. This API writes the specified string to the file. After writing, it's important to close the PrintWriter to free up system resources and to ensure that the writing operation is completed."
