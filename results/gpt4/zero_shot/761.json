It first checks if the request is multipart/form-data, which is used for file uploads. It then creates a ServletFileUpload object and gets an iterator for the items in the form data. It iterates over these items, and if the item is a file (not a form field), it gets the file name and extension. It then creates a new File object for the uploaded file and a PrintWriter to write to this file. It reads from the input stream of the uploaded file and writes to the PrintWriter, effectively saving the uploaded file to the specified directory."

I am stuck trying to figure out how to get the file extension of the uploaded file, how to write the file to a directory and the worst part is where the person who wrote the example comments // Process the input stream... It leaves me wondering if it's something so trivial that I'm the only one  who doesn't know how to. \nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
