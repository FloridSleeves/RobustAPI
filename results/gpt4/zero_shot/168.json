We then wrap this InputStream with an InputStreamReader, which is further wrapped by a BufferedReader. The BufferedReader provides a method readLine() which reads a line of text. A line is considered to be terminated by any one of a line feed ('\\n'), a carriage return ('\\r'), or a carriage return followed immediately by a linefeed. We then loop through each line until there are no more lines (when readLine() returns null), printing each line to the console. Finally, we close the BufferedReader, which also closes the underlying InputStreamReader and InputStream."
