The PrintWriter is initialized with a new OutputStreamWriter object, which is in turn initialized with a new FileOutputStream object. The FileOutputStream is given the path to the file that we want to write to. The OutputStreamWriter is given the FileOutputStream and the character encoding (\"UTF-8\") that we want to use. Then we use the write method of the PrintWriter object to write the string \"TweetId,UserScreenName,Tweet,TimeStamp\" to the file. Finally, we close the PrintWriter to ensure that all changes are written to the file and resources are freed."
