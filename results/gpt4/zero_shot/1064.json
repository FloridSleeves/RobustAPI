The delimiter is set to \",\" which means that the string is split at each comma. The nextToken() method is used to get the next token (substring) from the StringTokenizer. We then write the desired output to another file. The output file will contain the word \"Average\" followed by the name and surname from the input file, and then the rest of the tokens from the input line. This is done for each line in the input file."

I'm new to java reading from files, and I don't know how to work with just some parts of what I readHere is the initial file: http://pastebin.com/D0paWtAdAnd I have to write in another file the following output:Average,Joe,44,31,18,12,9,10I've managed just to take everything from the file and print it to output. I would need help just in taking the output I need and print it to the screen. Any help is appreciated.This is what I wrote up to now:public class FileParsing {public static Stringread(String filename) throws IOException {BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"C:\\\\Users\\\\Bogdi\\\\Desktop\\\\example.txt\"));String s;StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();while((s = in.readLine())!= null)   sb.append(s + \"\\n\");in.close();return sb.toString();}\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
