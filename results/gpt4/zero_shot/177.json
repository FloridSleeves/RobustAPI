You have to manually handle the padding. In the given code, we are reading the binary file generated by C into a byte array using InputStream.read method. We are assuming that the struct is written as 1 byte for char, followed by 3 bytes of padding, and then 4 bytes for int. We then extract the char and int values from the byte array. The char is simply the first byte, and the int is constructed from the next 4 bytes. Note that this code assumes that the int is written in big-endian format. If the int is written in little-endian format, you would need to reverse the order of the bytes."

As the example in the link says, when writing a struct like this:struct { char c; int i;} a;to a binary file, the compiler will usually leave an unnamed, unused hole between the char and int fields, to ensure that the int field is properly aligned. How could I to create an exact replica of the binary output file (generated in C), using a different language (in my case, Java)?Is there an automatic way to apply C padding in Java output? Or do I have to go through compiler documentation to see how it works (the compiler is g++ by the way).\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
