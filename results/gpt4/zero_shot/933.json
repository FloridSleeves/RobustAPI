The `saveHighScore` method takes a string (the high score) as a parameter. It then opens a connection to your server, sends a POST request with the high score as the body, and then closes the connection. Note that you'll need to replace \"http://yourserver.com/highscore.txt\" with the actual URL of your server. Also, your server needs to be set up to accept POST requests and save the data to a file."

I want to save the highscore on my server. I think the easiest way is to overwrite a textfile on my server that stores the scores and the names of the top players. How can I do this? The game is not running on my server! It is running on the client side.\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:"
