In the server code, a FileInputStream is created to read the file into a byte array. This byte array is then written to the DataOutputStream which is connected to the socket's output stream. On the client side, a DataInputStream is used to read the data from the socket's input stream. The data is read into a byte array and then written to a FileOutputStream. The while loop continues to read and write data until there is no more data to read. This ensures that the entire file is received and written to the file."

Thanks in advance.Here is the sending server-thread codetry{       out.println(\"AcceptFile,\");    FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(fn);    byte[] buffer = new byte[fis.available()];    fis.read(buffer);    ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream()) ;    oos.writeObject(buffer);    oos.flush();}catch(Exception c){    System.err.println(\"exc\" + c);}Here is the Client-thread receivingtry{    ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(socket.getInputStream());                    byte[] buffer = (byte[])ois.readObject();                    String pic=\"copy\"+studId+\".pdf\";                    System.out.println(pic);                    FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(pic);                    fos.write(buffer);                      fos.flush();                    fos.close();    }catch(Exception e){    System.out.println(\"Exception writing\");}\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:"
