We create a byte array of size 1024 and use the read method to fill this array with data. The read method returns the number of bytes actually read or -1 if the end of the stream is reached. We then write these bytes to a ByteArrayOutputStream. After all data is read, we convert the ByteArrayOutputStream to a byte array. This byte array contains the data read from the server."

I am using a Socket to connect to a server, creating a http GET request, then am using a Buffered Reader to read in data. Here is what the code looks like compacted:    Socket conn = new Socket(server, 80);    //Request made here    BufferedReader inFromServer = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(conn.getInputStream()));    String response;    while((response = inFromServer.readLine()) != null){        System.out.println(response);    }I would like to read in the data, instead of as a String, as a byte array, and write it to a file. How is this possible? Any help is greatly appreciated, thank you.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
