This collection is then converted into an iterator, which allows you to traverse through the collection one element at a time using the `next` method. The `next` method returns the next element in the iteration, which in this case is the special node you're looking for.\n\nThe second line of code does not work because the `getVertexByKey` method does not exist in the OrientDB API. This is why you're getting an error when you try to run this line of code. If you want to get a specific vertex by its key, you should use the `getVertices` method as shown in the first line of code."

The OrientDB contains one unique node with the property \"SPECIAL-NODE\". I want to query the database for this node and print it out. I have one line of code that works using an iterator (see below) and one that does not (below at bottom). It seems like both should work yet only the first does, the second does not. Why is this the case?Thanks!// create Orient graph object and connect to database, works successfullyOrientGraph ograph = new OrientGraph(\"remote:localhost/test\", \"username\", \"password\");// this WORKS - finds the one special node and prints it outIterator<Vertex> i =ograph.getVertices(\"SPECIAL-NODE\", \"SPECIAL\").iterator();System.out.println(i.next());// this DOES NOT WORK. WHY???System.out.println(\"SPECIAL NODE: \" + ograph.getVertexByKey(\"SPECIAL-NODE\",   \"SPECIAL\"));\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
