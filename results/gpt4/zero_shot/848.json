It then creates a buffer of size 1MB. The `seek` method is used to move the file pointer to the start of the 3rd MB in the file. The `read` method is then used to read up to 1MB of data from the file into the buffer. The number of bytes actually read is returned and stored in `bytesRead`. Finally, the `RandomAccessFile` is closed. If less than 1MB of data is available to read (for example, if the file is less than 4MB in size), the `read` method will read as much as it can and return the number of bytes actually read."

I'd like to take advantage of this feature.Here's the scenario.File FOO.BAR is 20 MB.  I'd split it into some arbitrary chunk size, let's say 1 MB, which means 20 chunks.   Chunks #3 and #14 fail (maybe the cellular/WiFi connection was bad).  I can now re-upload just these two chunks and everything will be good.What I'd like to know is how can I read only part of a file (like the data between 3MB and 4MB)?  The file piece should be an InputStream or File object.Thanks,Makoto\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:"
