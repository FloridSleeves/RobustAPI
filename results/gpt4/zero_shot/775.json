To fix this, I moved the Violin class methods to the ViolinGonzalezAP3 class and made them static so they can be accessed without creating an instance of the class. In the ViolinDriverGonzalezAP3 class, I replaced all instances of Violin with ViolinGonzalezAP3. I also replaced all instances of PrintWriter.println with PrintWriter.write as per the API requirement."

I am working with 2 files. One defines a class and all of it's methods and another constructs an instance of this class. My project requires that we write the output from the class methods to a file.When I try to import file 1 into file 2 I keep getting \"cannot resolve\" error any ideas why?
