Instead, you are passing a string \"file.txt\" to the PrintWriter constructor which is not the correct file path. You should pass the File object to the PrintWriter constructor. Also, the PrintWriter constructor can throw a FileNotFoundException if the file does not exist and cannot be created, or if it cannot be opened for any other reason. Therefore, you should put the code that creates the PrintWriter object inside a try-catch block to handle the exception. The PrintWriter.write method is used to write a string to the file."
