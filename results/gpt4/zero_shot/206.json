One file is from the local file system and the other is downloaded from a URL. It uses InputStream.read() to read one byte at a time from each file. If it finds a byte that doesn't match, it immediately returns false, indicating that the files are not identical. If it reaches the end of the files without finding any differences, it returns true, indicating that the files are identical. This method is memory-efficient because it only needs to store two bytes in memory at any given time, regardless of the size of the files."

We have tried to compare by byte[] arrays (we used HTTPRequestBuilder by Apache), but the concern is that the files may be too large and they may exhaust the memory. Do we have any good alternates.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
