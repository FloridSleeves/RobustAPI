When you call ImageIO.read(), it reads until it finds the end of an image, and then stops. When you call it again, it tries to read from where it left off, but it doesn't find the start of a new image, so it returns null.\n\nTo solve this problem, you can use ObjectOutputStream and ObjectInputStream to send and receive the images as byte arrays. This way, each call to readObject() will correspond to a single image, and you won't have any issues with ImageIO.read() returning null. \n\nIn the server code, we create an ObjectOutputStream from the socket's OutputStream. Then, for each image, we write it to a ByteArrayOutputStream using ImageIO.write(), and then write the resulting byte array to the ObjectOutputStream using writeObject().\n\nIn the client code, we create an ObjectInputStream from the socket's InputStream. Then, in the loop, we read a byte array from the ObjectInputStream using readObject(), and then read an image from this byte array using ImageIO.read()."

So I wondered if ImageIO could detect the end of an image. (I have absolutely no knowledge of the JPEG format, so I tested it instead)Apparently, not.On the server side, I sent images continuously by using ImageIO.write(...) in loop with some sleeping in between. On the client side, ImageIO read the first image no problem, but on the next one it returned null. This is confusing. I was expecting it to either block on reading the first image (because it thinks the next image is still part of the same image), or succeed at reading all of them (because it works). What is going on? It looks like ImageIO detects the end of the first image, but not the second one. (The images, by the way, are similar to each other roughly) Is there an easy way to stream images like this or do I have to make my own mechanism that reads the bytes into a buffer until it reaches a specified byte or sequence of bytes, at which point it reads the image out of the buffer?This is the useful part of my server code:        while(true){            Socket sock=s.accept();            System.out.println(\"Connection\");            OutputStream out=sock.getOutputStream();            while(!socket.isClosed()){                BufferedImage img=//get image                ImageIO.write(img, \"jpg\", out);                Thread.sleep(100);            }            System.out.println(\"Closed\");        }And my client code:        Socket s=new Socket(InetAddress.getByName(\"localhost\"), 1998);        InputStream in=s.getInputStream();        while(!s.isClosed()){            BufferedImage img=ImageIO.read(in);            if(img==null)//this is what happens on the SECOND image            else // do something useful with the image        }\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
