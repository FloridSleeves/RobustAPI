The Integer.reverseBytes method is used to convert the integer from the native byte order of the machine (which is usually little endian) to big endian. The length of the payload string is obtained by calling the getBytes method, which returns the number of bytes in the string when it is encoded in the platform's default charset. The payload string is then written to the DataOutputStream. Finally, the contents of the ByteArrayOutputStream are converted to a byte array and printed out in hexadecimal format."

I have to send messages to a server to receive the data that I need. There is a field after the message's header which is \"Length\": The length is the total number of bytes in the payload, which includes  all instances of the Param and Delim fields and excludes the header  and framing characters. The length is a 4-byte unsigned long in  network order (big endian).The only two examples in the documentation are these:if payload is 5022=LoginUser|5028=abc|5029=def|5026=1the length field is <0x00><0x00><0x00><0x27>if payload is 5022=Subscribe|4=558|5026=2the length field is <0x00><0x00><0x00><0x1B>I've tried some approaches without success. Any idea on how to handle with this would be very appreciated. Thank You\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:"
