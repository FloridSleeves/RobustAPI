It takes a list of iterators and stores them in a queue. When `hasNext()` is called, it checks if the first iterator in the queue has a next element. If it does, it returns true. If it doesn't, it removes the iterator from the queue and checks the next one. When `next()` is called, it first checks if there is a next element using `hasNext()`. If there is, it returns the next element from the first iterator in the queue. If there isn't, it throws a `NoSuchElementException`. This way, it iterates through the iterators in the order they were given, but within each iterator, it only advances when `next()` is called."

The solution I found iterate through one iterator first, and then move on to the next one. However, what I want is when next() gets called, it first returns the first element from the first iterator. Next time when next() gets called, it returns the first element from the second iterator, and so on.Thanks\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
