If no byte is available because the end of the stream has been reached, the returned value will be -1. \n\nThe problem you are facing is due to the fact that InputStream.read() returns an unsigned byte as an int, but when you are comparing it with 0 or 128, it is being treated as a signed int. \n\nTo solve this, you should check if the returned value is -1 (which indicates the end of the stream) instead of 0. \n\nFor the second issue, you need to mask the int with 0xFF to get the actual unsigned byte value. This is because in Java, bytes are signed, so any value above 127 is considered negative. By doing a bitwise AND with 0xFF, you are effectively converting the signed byte into an unsigned one. \n\nThe value 65533 or binary 11111101 is the Unicode replacement character, which is used to replace an incoming character whose value is unknown or unrepresentable in Unicode. This happens when the byte value is 128 or more because these values are not valid in Unicode. \n\nBy masking the int with 0xFF, you are ensuring that only the lower 8 bits (which represent the byte value) are used, and any sign or higher bits are ignored. This will give you the correct byte value."

If the client sends me a byte of value 0, it is not received by the server. The second issue is, if the byte value is 128 or more, I keep receiving a value of 65533 or a binary value of 11111101. Anyone knows how to solve these issues. I am a beginner in networking on JAVA.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
