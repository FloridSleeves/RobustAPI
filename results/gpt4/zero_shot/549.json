It then gets an ImageWriter for the JPEG2000 format using the ImageIO.getImageWritersByFormatName(\"JPEG2000\") method, which returns an Iterator of ImageWriters. The .next() method is used to get the first ImageWriter from this Iterator. The output file is set to \"output.jp2\", and an ImageOutputStream is created for this file. The ImageWriter's output is then set to this ImageOutputStream. The write parameters are set to the default parameters, and the image is written to the output file. Finally, the ImageOutputStream and ImageWriter are closed to free up resources."

I went through this way: Preferences -> Java -> Compiler -> Errors / Warnings -> Deprecated and Restricted API. Then i changed errors to warnings. But now i can not use that library efficient, cause eclipse suggest me nothing about that library.My first question is; if there is a better way to do that? Or maybe another way to use this library efficient in eclipse?EDIT: I found out it was a complication of 32 and 64 bit versions. After installing 32bit JDK and reference the jai_imageio.jar it worked fine.And second; Can anybody give a plain example to me about converting .bmp image to jpeg2000 image. That would help a lot to me about undesrtanding the context.Thank you\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
