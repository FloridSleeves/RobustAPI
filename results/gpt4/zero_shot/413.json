It creates an iterator over the original list and then iterates over the list, adding elements to a temporary list until it reaches the desired size (n). Once the temporary list is of size n, it is added to the list of lists and a new temporary list is created. This process continues until there are no more elements in the original list. This approach is more efficient because it only iterates over the list once, whereas the original approach iterated over the list multiple times."

Any pseudocode will do.    for (int i = 1; i <= Math.floor((A.size() / n)); i++) {            ArrayList temp = subArray(A, ((i * n) - n),                    (i * n) - 1);            // do stuff with temp        }    private ArrayList<Comparable> subArray(ArrayList A, int start,                int end) {            ArrayList toReturn = new ArrayList();            for (int i = start; i <= end; i++) {                toReturn.add(A.get(i));            }            return toReturn;        }where A is the list and n is the size of the desired listsI believe this way is taking too much time when working with considerably large lists of up to 1 million in size, so I'm trying to figure out what would be more efficient.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
