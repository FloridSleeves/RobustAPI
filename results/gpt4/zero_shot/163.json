It attempts to read as many bytes as possible by repeatedly invoking the read method of the underlying stream. This iterates until all the bytes are read. The number of bytes actually read is returned as an integer. This method blocks until input data is available, the end of the stream is detected, or an exception is thrown. If len is zero, then no bytes are read."

Client will keep streaming data requests to my server app through the socket. Request is a POST with a binary payload which needs to be copied to a byte array which i need to use to get the protocol buffer class.POST / HTTP/1.1Host: 127.0.0.1:80Accept-Encoding: identityContent-Length: 423Content-type: application/octet-stream[PAYLOAD]val out = new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream())val in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()))Any ideas ? UPDATE - I got a temporary solution using a DEPRECATED java function - DataInputStream.readLine.Can someone make this code better ?val in = new DataInputStream(socket.getInputStream())var n:Int = 0var size:Int=0while (n==0) {    var str=in.readLine    if(str==\"\"){        n =1    }else{        val breaks=str.split(\" \")        if(breaks(0).equals(\"Content-Length:\"))size=breaks(1).toInt    }}var payload:Array[Byte]=new Array(size)n=size-1for(i <- 0 to n) payload(i)=in.readByte\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
