This command creates a named pipe at the specified location (in this case, \\\\\\\\.\\\\pipe\\\\mypipe). After the pipe is created, we open a FileOutputStream to the pipe file and write to it using the write() method. The String.getBytes() method is used to convert the string \"Hello, World!\" into a byte array, which is then written to the pipe."

Thus I would like to know how to create a named pipe in Windows from Java. In Linux I can use mkfifo (called using Runtime.exec() ), but how should I do this on Windows?\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:"
