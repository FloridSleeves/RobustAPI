A byte array is created to hold the data to be written. A while loop is used to read data from a file input stream and write it to the DataOutputStream. The number of bytes read from the file input stream is added to a counter (totalBytesWritten) after each write operation. This counter will hold the total number of bytes written to the DataOutputStream."

The server will send bytes to the client by calling DataOutputStream's write(bytes[] b), the DataOutputStream is wrapped around client.getOutputStream directly(no Buffer here).   This is a file download functionality And I'm going to support resume, I didn't use any HTTP here, I've implemented my own simple protocol.  I've seen these questions on SO :1-question1.2-C# question.3-FileChannel question.   The first doesn't answer my question, I can't wrap DataOutputStream around ByteArrayOutputStream because the latter can't be wrapped around client.getOutputStream and I don't know how to implement my own write(int i) method(And don't want to use JNI).   the second is C# not java(and it's calling WIN API anyway, I'm a linux user by the way :) ).   The third is talking about FileChannels and HTTP, As I said I'm not using HTTP and I'm using java Socket's API.  So how to get how many bytes were actually written ?PS (EDIT)By resume support I mean I'll give the client the ability to stop download at specific byte and then after a while(minutes,hours,days,whatever) he/she can resume download from where it has left.   \nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:"
