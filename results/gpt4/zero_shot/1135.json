The method nextToken() is used to get the next token from the string. The first token is the item name and the second token is the price. The price is converted from String to Double using Double.parseDouble() method. The item name and price are then put into the TreeMap. This code does not use Scanner and does not initialize any variables with null."

It looks like this:Shoes 10.00Jersey 20.00Cookies 15.00Light Bulbs 2.00Paper 5.00I want to map every item to how much it costs and my current code works just fine. However, it looks a bit clunky and initializes variables with null that my project's submission server doesn't like and treats as a bug. I'm looking for a way to translate this into something a lot more elegant and thus learn to read files another way apart from relying on the Scanner class. Maybe using BufferedReader or PrintReader or something of the ilk that I have never really grasped. Help appreciated.    private TreeMap<String, Double> prices = new TreeMap<String, Double>();     public void readFromFile(String fileName){                File file = new File(fileName);                Scanner sc = null; //Server treats this as a bug.                 try {                    sc = new Scanner(file);                } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {                    e.printStackTrace();                }                while (sc.hasNextLine()) {                    Scanner sc2 = new Scanner(sc.nextLine());                    while (sc2.hasNext()) {                        String s = sc2.next(); //Gets the item name                        prices.put(s, Double.parseDouble(sc2.next())); //The next word is the price                        }                    sc2.close();                    }}\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
