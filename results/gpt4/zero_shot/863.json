The `Cipher` instance is initialized with the \"AES/ECB/NoPadding\" transformation, which means it uses AES encryption with ECB mode and no padding. The `append` method encrypts the message and writes the encrypted bytes to the end of the file. The `close` method closes the file. Note that the message length must be a multiple of the block size (16 bytes for AES), otherwise an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown. This is because AES encryption requires the input to be a multiple of the block size, and we're not using any padding to fill up incomplete blocks."

Unfortunately, cryptography is not my strong side. Now I can write to file several messages and then close file. Then i can open it, append some messages, close again and after decryption I see padding bytes in the middle of file. Is there any way to work with encrypted file without having to decrypt it every time I want to append some messages?EDIT: little more details. Current implementation utlizes CipherOutputStream. As i understand there's no way to seek using it.Can i use 'NoPadding' option if i will control that output data size is divisible by block size?\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.write.\nAnswer:"
