The Iterator interface provides methods to iterate over any Collection. We are using the `next()` method to move the iterator to the next element in the collection. \n\nWe maintain three variables: `previous`, `current`, and `next`. At the start of each iteration, `current` is the element we are examining, `previous` is the element before it, and `next` is the element after it. If `current` is the object we are searching for, we can then perform operations on `previous` and `next`. \n\nNote that `previous` will be `null` on the first iteration and `next` will be `null` on the last iteration. You should add null checks in your code where necessary."

But when it returns true (so it finds what I look for), it should perform the code on the previous and the next item.  Clarification: I have java.awt.Component elements!\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
