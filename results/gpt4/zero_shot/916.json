This method converts the string into a sequence of bytes and returns it as an array of bytes. You are using this method to convert the `vcard` string into bytes, which you then use to create a new `ByteArrayInputStream`. This input stream is then used to read the vcard data. \n\nThe `getBytes()` method is useful when you need to convert string data into bytes, for example when you want to send the data over a network or save it to a file. In your case, you are using it to create an input stream from the vcard string, which you then use to create a `Document` object with the `SAXReader`. \n\nHowever, if the avatars are not updating as expected, the issue might not be with the `getBytes()` method, but with how the vcard data is being handled or updated in the rest of your code."

Unfortunately, the plugin does not work as expected - VCard changes are propogated into the database (ofVcard table), but neither the user whose userpic was updated nor his buddies see the refreshed image. Here is how I create/update the VCards:   ...   XMPPServer server = XMPPServer.getInstance();   VCardManager vcardManager = server.getVCardManager();public void createOrUpdateVcard(String username, String vcard)                              throws Exception {                    SAXReader reader = new SAXReader();                    reader.setValidation(false);                    // convert String into InputStream                    InputStream is = new ByteArrayInputStream(vcard.getBytes());                    // read it with BufferedReader                    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(is));                    try {                              // Reading malformed XML will lead to DocumentException                              Document document = reader.read(is);                              Element vCardElement = document.getRootElement();                              log.info(\"Username: \" + username);                              vcardManager.setVCard(username, vCardElement);                    } catch (DocumentException e) {                              throw new MalformedXmlException(e);                    }     }     ...When I change avatars directly from the client (we are using Jitsi), the changes are not only immediately stored in the database, but all the buddies get the refreshed image. I see that VCardManager, which I use, dispatches events internally:VCardEventDispatcher.dispatchVCardUpdated(username, newvCard);but they seem not to have any effect.I cannot figure out what is the difference between the way the setVcard method is called from the handleIQ(IQ packet) in IQvCardHandler and in my own code. What am I missing?\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:"
