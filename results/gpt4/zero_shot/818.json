This is why only the last score is being saved. To fix this, the StringWriter and PrintWriter objects should be created outside the for loop. Then, inside the loop, you can use the PrintWriter.write method to write each score to the StringWriter. After each score, a comma is added for separation. After the loop, the PrintWriter is flushed and closed to ensure all data is written to the StringWriter. Finally, the StringWriter is converted to a String and returned."

It gives a different score every time, which I need to save to a String (or file, but I guess a string would be easier, because I need it to be empty at every new call for the database).I want to store all the scores by going through the loop, and then adding a , after each score (to keep them seperate) but my code isn't working because a part of the code is outside the for loop. How do I fix this? Or are there better/other methods to do what I want to create?DatabaseHandler db = new DatabaseHandler(camera.this);List<Database> contacts = db.getAllContacts();for (Database contact : contacts) {    String test = contact.getMP();    StringWriter stringWriter = new StringWriter();    PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(stringWriter);    printWriter.println(test);}  printWriter.flush();printWriter.close();return stringWriter.toString();\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
