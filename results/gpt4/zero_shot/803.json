However, you can achieve the same functionality using the PrintWriter and FileWriter classes. The FileWriter constructor accepts a boolean parameter that, when set to true, allows data to be appended to the file. The PrintWriter is then used to write the string to the file. The try-with-resources statement is used to ensure that the PrintWriter is closed after use."
