In your case, you want to write the number 12 to the file. Since PrintWriter.write takes a string as an argument, you need to convert the number 12 to a string using String.valueOf method. This will write the string representation of the number 12 to the file."

I actually wanna write a binary file. In MATLAB I am simply calling:fwrite(filename, A, precision)How could I achieve the same in JAVA?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
