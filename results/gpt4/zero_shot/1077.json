It then iterates through these directories. If the directory is not the primary external storage (internal storage), it is the external SD card. The path of the external SD card is then extracted from the file path. The StringTokenizer.nextToken API is not used in this solution as it is not needed to solve the problem."

To test my code, I have tried to hardcode the path of SD card like,File file = new File(\"/storage/632E-1AFA/Champion.mp4\");But now I want to make this app run on multiple devices. So I want a universal method to get the external SD card path. I have tried the getExternalStorageDirectory method but it points to the internal storage of the phone. The getExternalFilesDir points to your internal application files. I have also tried the System.getenv() method with the help of - Android Open External Storage directory(sdcard) for storing file and Find an external SD card location but it is returning a null path when I tried to debug the code.My app includes both the read and write permissions for external storage:<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\" /><uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\" />I am testing my app on Android 6.0, so I have included the run-time permissions as well. Please if someone could help me find a method or an approach that would get the path of an external sd card to run on multipe mobile devices, I would greatly appreciate it.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
