It retrieves the file from the request, reads its content into a byte array, and then writes that byte array to a new file in the server's upload directory. If the file upload is successful, it sends a success message back to the client. If there's an exception, it sends an error message back to the client. The PrintWriter.write API is used to send these messages back to the client."
