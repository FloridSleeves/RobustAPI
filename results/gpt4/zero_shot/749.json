We declare a static PrintWriter object at the class level so that it can be accessed by all methods in the class. In the main method, we initialize the PrintWriter object with a FileOutputStream object that is set to append mode (true). This allows us to keep the file open and append to it in other methods. We then use the write method to write a string to the file. In the otherMethod, we also use the write method to append another string to the same file. Finally, we close the PrintWriter in a finally block to ensure that the file is properly closed even if an exception occurs."
