It uses a buffer to limit the amount of data in memory at any one time, which helps to avoid OutOfMemoryError. The buffer size is set to 8192 characters, but you can adjust this to suit your needs. The code reads the base64 content from the XML file, decodes it into bytes, and then converts these bytes into characters which are written to the output file. The loop continues until all the base64 content has been processed."

Problem: the file could easily reach the size of 100 MB. Every solution I tried ended with the \"java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space\". The problem is not reading the xml in general or the decoding process, but the size of the base64 block.I used jdom, dom4j and XMLStreamReader to access the xml file. However, as soon as I want to access the base64 content of the respective element I get the mentioned error. I also tried an xslt using saxon's base64Binary-to-octets function, but of course with the same result.Is there a way to stream this base64 encoded part into a file without getting the whole chunk in one single piece?Thanks for your hints,Andreas\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
