In your case, you are using it to read the output of the process. The problem you are facing is that you are closing the OutputStream after writing the first command. This is not necessary and is causing the problem. You should only close the OutputStream when you are done with all the commands. Instead of closing the OutputStream, you should flush it after writing each command. This will ensure that the command is sent to the process immediately. Also, instead of using InputStream.read method to read the output of the process, you should use BufferedReader.readLine method. This method reads a line of text. A line is considered to be terminated by any one of a line feed ('\\n'), a carriage return ('\\r'), or a carriage return followed immediately by a linefeed. This will ensure that you read the complete output of the process."

If I dont call this method the command line isn't executed.I want to execute more than one command but I can't.Example:\"Call phone\" and then \"terminate\" to end the call whenever I want. But I can only insert the first command line and if I dont use the close() method the command line is not executed.Code:Start a process:ProcessBuilder builder = new ProcessBuilder(PROCESS);builder.redirectErrorStream(true);Process p = builder.start();Read the InputStream of Process:InputStream i = p.getInputStream();System.out.print((char)i.read());while(i.available() > 0){    System.out.print((char)i.read());}Insert command line into OutputStream:String command = com.nextLine();OutputStream o = p.getOutputStream();o.write(comando.getBytes());o.flush();o.close();If I delete \"o.close()\" the command line is not executed, but if I execute it I can't execute the other command lines.I tried the code on my program, but when I insert the command line I dont see the next information of the process.When I put your code :ReadyWarning: video is disabled in linphonec, use -V or -C or -D to enable.linphonec> Registration on sip:XX.XX.XX.XX successful.linphonec> call XXXExemple with my code:ReadyWarning: video is disabled in linphonec, use -V or -C or -D to enable.linphonec> Registration on sip:XX.XX.XX.XX successful.linphonec> call XXXEstablishing call id to sip:XXX@XX.XX.XX.XX, assigned id 1With \"Available > 0\" I get \"Establishing call id to sip:XXX@XX.XX.XX.XX, assigned id 1\".If I use this loop I dont see the other info of the process.I think the problem is that the outputstream does not get the command lines until I execute the Close method.Thank you.Sorry for my bad englando.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
