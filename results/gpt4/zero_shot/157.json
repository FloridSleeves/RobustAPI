It overrides the `read()` and `read(byte[] b, int off, int len)` methods of `InputStream` to limit the number of bytes read from the input stream. \n\nIn the constructor, it takes an `InputStream` and a `size` parameter which specifies the maximum number of bytes to read from the input stream. \n\nThe `read()` method checks if the remaining bytes to read is 0, if so, it returns -1 indicating the end of the file (EOF). Otherwise, it decrements the remaining bytes and reads a byte from the input stream.\n\nThe `read(byte[] b, int off, int len)` method also checks if the remaining bytes to read is 0, if so, it returns -1 indicating EOF. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum of `len` and `remaining` to ensure it doesn't read more than the remaining bytes. It then reads from the input stream into the byte array `b` starting at offset `off` and for length `len`. If the result is not -1 (indicating EOF), it subtracts the number of bytes read from the remaining bytes."

So that the client code should see EOF once 100th byte is reached.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
