Each byte is then converted to a binary string (bits) using the Integer.toBinaryString() method. The String.format() method is used to ensure that each byte is represented by exactly 8 bits.\n\nFor writing bits to a file, we first convert the string of bits to an integer using the Integer.parseInt() method with 2 as the radix to indicate that the string represents a binary number. Then, we use the OutputStream.write() method to write this integer as a byte to the file."
