We are using PrintWriter to write output to \"output.txt\" and exceptions to \"error.txt\". We are reading until the end of the file is reached. If the next token in the file cannot be interpreted as an int value, the Scanner throws an InputMismatchException. We catch this exception and write it to \"error.txt\". All other output is written to \"output.txt\". At the end, we close the Scanner and the PrintWriter to free up system resources."

(JAVA): :I am supposed to Use Scanner to read int values from a file \u201cinput.txt\u201d, Read until end of file is reached, Write all program output to a file \u201coutput.txt\u201d, Write all exceptions to a file \u201cerror.txt\u201d, and Output each number read.I understand exceptions for the most part, but I do not understand how to write all exceptions to a text file in Java...\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
