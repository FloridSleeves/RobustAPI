When we add an employee to the department, we first check if the list of employees is empty. If it is, we set the minimum and maximum salary to the salary of the current employee. If the list is not empty, we compare the current employee's salary with the minimum and maximum salaries. If the current employee's salary is less than the minimum salary, we update the minimum salary. If it's more than the maximum salary, we update the maximum salary. Finally, we add the employee to the list. This way, we always have the minimum and maximum salaries of the employees in the department."

My main function reads off a .txt file filled with employee names, salaries, departments, and positions. My Employee class is just getters and setters. An list of arraylists are made to represent the employees and I'm not sure how I would find the minimum salary of each of the departments. To find the maximum salary I did this in my department class.public class Department {    String dept;    List<Employee> employees;    double minSal;    double maxSal;    public void addEmployee(Employee emp){        maxSal = 0.0;        if (maxSal < emp.getSalary()) {            maxSal = emp.getSalary();        }but I'm not sure how to get the minimum salary. My idea was to get the salary of one of the employees from each department and use that as a starting point for if (minSal > emp.getSalary()) {    minSalary = emp.getSalary();}But I realized I had no idea what to do. Can I get some help with this?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
