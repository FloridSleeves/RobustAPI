To avoid this, you should check if there are more tokens in the current line before calling nextToken() using the hasMoreTokens() method. If there are no more tokens, you should read the next line and create a new StringTokenizer for that line. If the next line is null, you should break the loop."

But every time I run the code I get no such element exception, i don't understand why?try {        FileReader fr = new FileReader(file);        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);        String line = br.readLine();        String id = new String();        StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(line, \",\");        while(line != null){            while(!id.equals(args[0])){                line = br.readLine();                id = st.nextToken();            }        }    } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {        System.out.println(\"file not found\");    } catch (IOException e) {        System.out.println(\"not a string\");    }The file looks something like this:line1: 118, s, m, pline2: 111, s, m, c\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
