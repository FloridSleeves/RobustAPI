Inside the constructor, we are iterating over the `Map` and checking the type of each value. If the value is not an instance of `String` or `List`, we throw an `IllegalArgumentException`. If the value is an instance of `List`, we further check if the first element of the list is a `String` or not. If it's not, we again throw an `IllegalArgumentException`. This way, we ensure that the `Map` only contains `String` or `List<String>` as values. The `List.get` API is used to retrieve the first element from the list for type checking."

Maybe I'm going about this the wrong way, but let's see where this question goes :)I would like a Map container that contains either Strings or lists of Strings. I want to enforce this rule during construction of this object so that you can't create a map with values that aren't either of those.e.g.class Record {  public Record(String key, Map<String,Object> attrs) {    // check that attrs only contains Objects which are Strings or List<Strings>  }}Other ways I have thought of to solve the problem might be...1)class Record {  public Record(String key, Map<String,String> attrs, Map<String,List<String>> multiAttrs) {    // ...  }}2)class Record {  public Record(String key, Map<String,Value> attrs) {    // ...  }}class Value {  // Create some funky class that encapsulates lists.  // Perhaps returning the only element in the list if the size is 1,  // but returning the list otherwise}I am not immediately excited at the alternatives, but I'm just putting it there as stuff I've already considered. Really I want the distinction between Strings and List to be transparent to the user of the class.\nPlease using this api: List.get.\nAnswer:"
