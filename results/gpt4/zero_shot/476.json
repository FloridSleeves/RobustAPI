Java is a strongly typed language, which means that you need to specify the type of objects that your code works with. In your case, you need to specify the type of keys and values in your map when you create the iterator and when you retrieve the next entry from it. This will help the compiler understand what type of objects it should expect and will eliminate the warnings."
