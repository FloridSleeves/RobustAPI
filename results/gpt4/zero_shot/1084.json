It then iterates over each interface, skipping any that are loopback interfaces or are not up. For each interface, it gets the list of `InetAddress` objects and iterates over them. For each address, it uses `StringTokenizer` to split the IP address into its four octets, and then constructs the gateway IP by taking the first three octets and appending \".1\" to the end. This assumes that the gateway is always at the \".1\" address, which is a common convention but not always true."

I can get my IP easily enough. I can get my internet IP using a service on a website. But how can I determine my gateway's IP?This is somewhat easy in .NET if you know your way around. But how do you do it in Java?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
