This means that every time you call `next()`, you are always getting the first item in the list, because a new iterator starts at the beginning of the list. To fix this, you should create a single iterator instance when the `SequenceSelector` is created, and use this same iterator every time you call `next()`. This way, the iterator will correctly move through the items in the list."

I should use iterator() in its methods. private class SequenceSelector implements Selector {    private T obj = items.iterator().next();    public boolean end() { return !items.iterator().hasNext(); }    public T current() { return obj; }    public void next() { obj = items.iterator().next(); }}items is a ArrayList. obj is a value in order to save the first sequence member before the first next() using.With a following code the program goes into an infinite loop in which is printed only the first member of sequence. while(!selector.end()) {      System.out.print(selector.current() + \" \");      selector.next();}Why does this happens? Though I use next() method, the iterator doesn't move.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
