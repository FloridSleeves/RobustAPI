The `afterTextChanged` method is called to notify you that, somewhere within `s`, the text has been changed. It is here that you can handle the input after each key press. The `Activity.setContentView` method is used to set the layout resource to be used by the activity. In this case, it is `R.layout.activity_main`, which is an XML file in the res/layout directory that includes all the UI components (like EditText) used in the activity."
