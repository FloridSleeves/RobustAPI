However, since each line only contains one token (either \"COMBO\" or \"ADEFGA\"), the same variable 'sam' is used to store the token from each line, hence overwriting the previous value. To solve this, two separate string variables 'firstToken' and 'secondToken' are introduced. The 'firstToken' is assigned the token from the first line (i.e., \"COMBO\") and 'secondToken' is assigned the token from the second line (i.e., \"ADEFGA\"). The check 'firstToken == null' is used to ensure that 'firstToken' is only assigned once, and 'secondToken' is assigned for the subsequent lines."

The \"ride.in\" file contains two lines, one containing the string \"COMBO\" and the other line containing the string \"ADEFGA\".  As I said, each string is on separate lines, so \"COMBO\" is on the first line, while \"ADEFGA\" is on the second line in the \"ride.in\" file.Here is my code: public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {File in = new File(\"ride.in\");File out = new File(\"ride.out\");String line;in.createNewFile();out.createNewFile();BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(in));PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(out)));while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {    StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(line);    String sam =st.nextToken();}pw.close();}    }I want to assign COMBO as one token and ADEFGA as another token, but in this code, both COMBO and ADEFGA are assigned to the sam string. How do I assign COMBO to one string, and ADEFGA to another string?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
