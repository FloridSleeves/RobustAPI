This method returns the next element in the iteration. In the context of your LinkedList class, this method should return the next element in your LinkedList. Currently, your `next()` method is returning null, which means it's not doing anything useful yet. You will need to implement the logic for traversing your LinkedList and returning the next element.\n\nAs for your question about where to define the `hasNext()`, `next()`, and `remove()` methods, it's not uncommon to define these methods directly in the class that implements the Iterable and Iterator interfaces, especially if the class is not expected to be used as a superclass. However, defining these methods in a separate inner class can make your code more organized and easier to maintain, especially if your LinkedList class is complex or if you want to provide different ways of iterating over your LinkedList.\n\nIn your case, if your instructor has not specified where to define these methods, you could ask for clarification. If you decide to define these methods in a separate inner class, you would indeed need to return an instance of that class in your `iterator()` method."

Here is the header for the shell of the class:public class LinkedList<T> implements Iterable<T>, Iterator<T>Note he is implementing the Iterable and Iterator interfaces. I then understand that I need to implement an iterator(), hasNext(), next(), and remove() methods in my class. What confuses me though is that he does not put the methods required for the Iterator interface in a separate inner class. All of the methods below are defined in the LinkedList class:/* * (non-Javadoc) *  * @see java.lang.Iterable#iterator() */@Overridepublic Iterator<T> iterator(){    return null;}/* * (non-Javadoc) *  * @see java.util.Iterator#hasNext() */@Overridepublic boolean hasNext(){    return false;}/* * (non-Javadoc) *  * @see java.util.Iterator#next() */@Overridepublic T next(){    return null;}/* * (non-Javadoc) *  * @see java.util.Iterator#remove() */@Overridepublic void remove(){}Shouldn't the iterator() method be returning something like:public Iterator<T> iterator(){    return new MyClassIterator(front);}Where MyClassIterator() is defined with the hasNext(), next(), and remove() methods. What am I missing?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
