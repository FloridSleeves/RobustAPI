If it is set to true, the data will be written to the end of the file rather than overwriting the existing content."

I want to write to a text file that stores the data on two seperate lines, but I don't know how to work it.    File termsOfAgreement = new File(gamePath + \"/terms.txt\");    try {        termsOfAgreement.createNewFile();    } catch (IOException exc) {        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, \"Cannot create files! :(\",\"Alas, something went wrong!\", JOptionPane.ERROR_MESSAGE);        System.exit(0);    }    String pathway = termsOfAgreement.getPath();    try {        this.writeToFile(pathway, \"username\", \"passcode\");    } catch (IOException exc) {        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, \"Cannot work with files! :(\",\"Alas, something went wrong!\", JOptionPane.ERROR_MESSAGE);        System.exit(0);    }}public void writeToFile(String filePath, String username, String passcode) throws IOException {    FileWriter filewriter = new FileWriter(filePath);    BufferedWriter bufferedwriter = new BufferedWriter(filewriter);    String[] credentials = {username, passcode};    String writtenStuffs = \"\";    for (String credit : credentials) {        writtenStuffs += credit + \"\\n\";    }    bufferedwriter.write(writtenStuffs);    bufferedwriter.close(); }}I made an array, but it didn't seem to help.
