The StringBuilder is more efficient than using a String for concatenation in a loop. After the loop, we use the PrintWriter.write method to write the entire contents of the StringBuilder to the output file. The \"\\n\" is used to add a new line after each line from the input file."

I'm trying to modify the text from testfile.txt and write it to a new file named mdemarco.txt. The modification I'm trying to do is add a line number in front of each line. Does anybody know a way to maybe write the contents of the while loop to a string while it runs and output the resulting string to mdemarco.txt or anything like that?public class Writefile{public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException{  try  {     Scanner file = new Scanner(new File(\"testfile.txt\"));     File output = new File(\"mdemarco.txt\");     String s = \"\";     String b = \"\";     int n = 0;     while(file.hasNext())     {        s = file.nextLine();        n++;        System.out.println(n+\". \"+s);        b = (n+\". \"+s);     }//end while     PrintWriter printer = new PrintWriter(output);     printer.println(b);     printer.close();  }//end try     catch(FileNotFoundException fnfe)  {     System.out.println(\"Was not able to locate testfile.txt.\");  }}//end main}//end classThe input file text is:doremefa solatedoAnd the output I'm getting is only8. doCan anybody help?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
