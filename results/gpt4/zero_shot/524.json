We have a method `addB(B b)` to add a new `B` instance to the set. Before adding, we check if the size of the set is already `N`. If it is, we use an `Iterator` to get the first element in the set (which is the oldest due to the nature of a `Set`) and remove it using `iterator.remove()`. Then we add the new `B` instance to the set. This way, we ensure that the size of the set never exceeds `N` and the oldest entry is removed when a new one is added."

Thanks in advance.EDITMy goal is not to have more than N number of entries in that table at any point of time. One solution I have is to use a Set and schedule a job to remove the older entries. But I find it dirty. I am looking for a cleaner solution.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
