The `write` method writes the same string to all the `PrintWriter` objects. The `close` method is used to close all the `PrintWriter` objects after writing. This way, you can write the same text to multiple files or streams using `PrintWriter`. \n\nAs for your question about whether this is already implemented in a library, to the best of my knowledge, there is no such feature in standard Java libraries. However, Apache Commons IO library provides `TeeOutputStream` and `TeeWriter` classes that can be used to write to multiple streams or writers respectively."
