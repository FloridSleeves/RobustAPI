The FileWriter constructor takes two parameters: the file name and a boolean indicating whether or not to append the data written. If the boolean is true, the data will be written to the end of the file rather than the beginning. This code opens the file, writes \"hello world\" to it, and then closes the file. If an IOException occurs during this process, it is caught and printed to the console. The changes made to the file are permanent."

So far, there haven't been any errors with accessing it. However, when I close the program or after when the files should have been written when I open the text file I don't find them there, however I did check the bin folder ocne and it seemed to print hello world to the temp copy there. I want the changes it makes to be permanent.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
