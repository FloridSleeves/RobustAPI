This byte array is then passed to the `MessageDigest` instance which is set to use the MD5 algorithm. The `md.digest()` method then processes the byte array and returns a new byte array that represents the MD5 hash of the input. We then convert this byte array into a hexadecimal string which is the encrypted URL. \n\nPlease note that MD5 is a cryptographic hash function, which means it takes an input (or 'message') and returns a fixed-size string of bytes, which is typically a 'digest' that is unique to each unique input. It does not encrypt the input in the traditional sense, as the output cannot be easily decrypted back into the original input. \n\nAlso, it's important to note that MD5 is considered to be a weak hash function as it is vulnerable to hash collisions, where different inputs produce the same output hash. Therefore, it's not recommended for functions requiring high levels of security."

But when I generate the URL of the files, it shows the authentication key, file name and etc. I need to encrypt the URL. Also I am using tiny url to shorten the URL but when I put the curser on the link it shows the real URL. I looked for md5 but I couldn't make it work. Is there any suggestion? \nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:"
