The check for the existence of the file and the creation of the file if it does not exist are a single operation that is atomic with respect to all other filesystem activities that might affect the file. This method returns true if the named file does not exist and was successfully created; false if the named file already exists. Note that if this operation fails it may have succeeded in creating some, but not all, of the necessary parent directories."
