In this case, the output of the SUM.exe command is read using a BufferedReader, which is created with an InputStreamReader that wraps the InputStream from the Process. The BufferedReader reads the output line by line in the while loop. The exit value of the process is obtained with pr.waitFor(), which waits for the process to terminate and returns the exit value. This exit value is typically 0 for a successful execution. The output of the SUM.exe command (i.e., the sum of the two numbers) is printed to the console."

I'm executing the EXE with Java using the following code:try {    pr = rt.exec(\"C:\\\\Users\\\\babesha.fm\\\\Desktop\\\\SUM.exe 10 5\");    int exitVal = pr.waitFor();    System.out.println(\"Exited with error code \" + exitVal);} catch (IOException e) {    // TODO Auto-generated catch block    e.printStackTrace();} catch (InterruptedException e) {    // TODO Auto-generated catch block    e.printStackTrace();}I used the return statement while creating the exe.But the problem is when I executed this exe by using the above java code. pr.waitFor(); statement returns the sum value instead of successful exicution.Did I done anything wrong .\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
