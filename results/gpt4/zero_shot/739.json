We first create a FileWriter object with the filename and a boolean value of true, which indicates that we want to append to the file rather than overwrite it. We then create a PrintWriter object with the FileWriter object as a parameter. We use the write method of the PrintWriter object to append the text to the file. The try-with-resources statement ensures that the FileWriter and PrintWriter objects are closed at the end of the statement."
