We then create a list of integers from 1 to the range. We shuffle this list to randomize the order of the integers. We then create an iterator for the list. We use a for loop to iterate through the list and print out the first 'sampleSize' number of integers. The Iterator.next() method is used to get the next integer from the iterator."

For example: for range 1 to 100 I would like to select a random sample of 20%. This would result in 20 integers randomly selected for 100. This is to solve an extremely complex issue and I will post solutions once I get this and a few bugs worked out. I have not used many math packages in java so I appreciate your assistance.Thanks!\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
