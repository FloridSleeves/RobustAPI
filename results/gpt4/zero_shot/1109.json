In this case, it is used to read the two integers from the input file. The `nextToken` method returns the next token from the string. If there are two numbers in the file separated by a space, the first call to `nextToken` will return the first number as a string, and the second call will return the second number. These strings are then converted to integers using `Integer.parseInt`. The sum of these two integers is then written to the output file. The `FileNotFoundException` you are seeing is likely because the file `test.in.txt` is not found in the project's root directory. Make sure the file is in the correct location."
