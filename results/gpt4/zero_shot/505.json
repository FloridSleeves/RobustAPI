In Java, when you initialize an array of integers, it automatically fills the array with 0s. So when you only fill in the odd numbers, the even indices are left as 0. \n\nTo fix this, you can use an ArrayList instead of an array. An ArrayList in Java is a resizable array, which means you can add and remove elements from it. In this case, you only add the odd numbers to the ArrayList, so there are no 0s left in the result. \n\nThe Iterator.next API is not needed in this case, as you are not iterating over a collection, but rather an array. The for loop is sufficient for this task."
