Each line is added to a list of lines. Then it tries to parse the lines. If the parsing is successful, it clears the lines and does some stuff with the result. If the parsing fails, it catches the exception and continues with the next line. This way, it can handle commands split into multiple lines and it doesn't hide real errors. It also doesn't reparse all lines every time, so it's not slow and doesn't run instructions twice."

The examples I've found on the web are all using a per line cycle, e.g.:while(readline)  result = parse(line)  doStuff(result)But what if I'm writing something like pascal/smtp/etc, with a \"first line\" looks like X requirment? I know it can be checked in doStuff, but I think logically it is part of the syntax.Or what if a command is split into multiple lines? I can trywhile(readline)  lines.add(line)  try    result = parse(lines)    lines = []    doStuff(result)  catch    nopBut with this I'm also hiding real errors.Or I could reparse all lines everytime, but:it will be slow there are instructions I don't want to run twiceCan this be done with ANTLR, or if not, with something else?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
