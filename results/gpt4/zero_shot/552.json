In your case, it returns an Object because it doesn't know the specific type of the elements in the collection. Since you know that the values in your hashtable are of type Long, you can cast the Object to Number first, and then call the longValue() method to get the long value. This way, you avoid the ClassCastException that occurs when you try to directly cast an Object to a long."

The type value is long. I am getting values using .values(). Now I want to access these values. Collection val = table.values();Iterator itr = val.iterator();long a  =   (long)itr.next();But when I try to get it, it gives me error because I can't convert from type object to long. How can I go around it?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
