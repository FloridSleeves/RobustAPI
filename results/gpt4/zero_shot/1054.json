In this case, we are using the ',' character as the delimiter to separate the string into two parts. The nextToken() method is used to get the next token from the StringTokenizer object. The trim() method is used to remove any leading or trailing spaces from the tokens. The first token is assigned to the 'name' variable and the second token is assigned to the 'description' variable."
