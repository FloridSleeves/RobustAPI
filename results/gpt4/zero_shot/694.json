We create a new PrintWriter object, passing it a new OutputStreamWriter object that is set to output to a file with the specified filename and with UTF-8 encoding. We then use the write method of the PrintWriter object to write the text to the file. Finally, we close the PrintWriter object to ensure that all changes are saved and resources are freed. If an IOException occurs during this process, it is caught and the stack trace is printed."
