The `hasNext()` and `next()` methods are overridden to add synchronization, ensuring that only one thread can access the underlying iterator at a time. The `finished()` method can be used to release the lock when the caller is done with the iterator. This is not a feature provided by the Java SE API, but it is relatively straightforward to implement."

Although the API's have the methods that return synchronised versions of common collections, there seems to be no way to programmatically release the lock by calling a finished method; AFAICT the lock appears to be released when the wrapper is garbage collected.Is there anything that does this in the Java SE API, or is it considered easy enough just to roll something myself? Thanks for your constructive input.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
