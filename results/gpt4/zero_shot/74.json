However, you can create multiple streams of different types on the same socket. In the provided code, both a DataOutputStream and an ObjectOutputStream are created on the same socket. The DataOutputStream is used to send commands as strings, and the ObjectOutputStream is used to send objects. However, it's important to note that the order of creating and using these streams matters. The ObjectOutputStream writes a header to the stream when it's constructed, so if you want to use both types of streams, you should construct and use the ObjectOutputStream first."

Is this possible and what is the best way to do it?I've tried just creating both types of objects, for example ObjectOutputStream and DataOutputStream, but that doesn't seem to work.The reason I want to switch between them is to, for example, send a text command \"INFO\" that signals I'm about to send an object with information or a command \"DATA\" signalling that I'm about to send data.  Any advice on the best way to do this is appreciated.\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:"
