Then it removes the key-value pair from the Properties object using the remove() method. After that, it opens the file again in write mode (which clears the file) and stores the Properties object back into the file. This effectively removes the key-value pair from the file. The PrintWriter.write API is not used in this case because the Properties class provides its own methods for manipulating properties files."
