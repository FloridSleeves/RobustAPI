StringTokenizer is a class in java.util package which allows us to break a string into tokens. It is more efficient than Scanner for this use case. The method nextToken() is used to return the next token from the string tokenizer. The method hasMoreTokens() is used to check if there are more tokens available from the string tokenizer's string. If there are more tokens available, it returns true, otherwise it returns false. This way, we avoid the NoSuchElementException."

However, now I want to switch from using the split method to another second scanner class to read each sentence to each word.import java.util.Scanner;import java.io.FileNotFoundException;import java.io.File;import java.io.PrintWriter;public class ScannerDemo{     public static void main(String args[]) {        String c = \"\";        try{            File file = new File(args[0]);            Scanner scanner = new Scanner(file);            PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(args[1]);         // as long as the scanner reads that the file has a next line               while (scanner.hasNextLine()) {        // read the first line of string in scanner s2                   Scanner s2 = new Scanner(scanner.nextLine());        // read the first word of first line from s2 as string \"counts\"                   String counts = s2.next();        // parse the string \"counts\" as int, \"count\"                   int count = Integer.parseInt(counts);        // as long as s2 has the next element                   while (s2.hasNext()){        // for loop executed \"count\" number of times to skip the words                       for (int x = 0; x < count; x ++){                           String b = s2.next();                        }       // else add the next words to string, \"c\"                           c += s2.next();                           c += \" \";                        }                    }        // close the scanner            scanner.close();        // output string \"c\" to the output file            writer.println(c);        // close the writer            writer.close();        }        catch (FileNotFoundException e) {            e.printStackTrace();  }   } }However, it gives out error messageException in thread \"main\" java.util.NoSuchElementExceptionI felt this error message is due to the second scanner class not closed properly. However, I did not figure out how to solve it after I added      s2.close();in the for loop.Any help is appreciated. Thank you but I am really new to Java, \nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
