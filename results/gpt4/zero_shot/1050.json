In this case, it is used to parse each line of the trace file into the access type and memory address. Instead of storing all the data in an ArrayList, the data is processed line by line, which reduces the amount of memory used. This approach avoids the OutOfMemoryError that occurs when trying to store all the data in memory at once."

First I need to read 1 or more trace files. Each contains memory addresses for each access. Example: 0 F001CBAD2 EEECA89F0 EBC17910...Where the first integer indicates a read/write etc. then the hex memory address follows. With this data, I am supposed to run a simulation. So the idea I had was parse these data into an ArrayList<Trace> (for now I am using Java) with trace being a simple class containing the memory address and the access type (just a String and an integer). After which I plan to loop through these array lists to process them. The problem is even at parsing, it running out of heap space. Each trace file is ~200MB. I have up  to 8. Meaning minimum of ~1.6 GB of data I am trying to \"cache\"? What baffles me is I am only parsing 1 file and java is using 2GB according to my task manager ... What is a better way of doing this? A code snippet can be found at Code Review\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
