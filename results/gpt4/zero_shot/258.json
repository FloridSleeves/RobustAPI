Then it converts this array to a list and creates a ListIterator for it, starting from the end of the list. It then iterates backwards through the list, appending each word and a space (if there is a previous word) to a StringBuilder. Finally, it returns the reversed string. The Iterator.next method is used implicitly by the ListIterator.previous method to move the cursor backwards through the list."

This question is ambiguous, vague, incomplete, overly broad, or rhetorical and  cannot be reasonably answered in its current form. For help clarifying this question so that it can be reopened,  visit the help center.                                                            Closed 11 years ago.Im reading the book \"programming interviews exposed\" and the following question was interesting to me:Write a function that reverses the order of the words in a string. For  example, your function should transform the string \u201cDo or do not,  there is no try.\u201d to \u201ctry. no is there not, do or Do\u201d. Assume that all  words are space delimited and treat punctuation the same as letters.this image was included to help with the design of the algorithm: what is the most efficient way of implementing this in JAVA?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
