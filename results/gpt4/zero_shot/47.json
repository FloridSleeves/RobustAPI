In Android, the UI can only be updated from the main thread. The `doInBackground()` method of `AsyncTask` runs on a background thread, so you can't update the UI from there. \n\nTo fix this, you should move the code that shows the `ProgressDialog` to the `onPreExecute()` method, which runs on the UI thread. This method is called before `doInBackground()`, so it's the perfect place to prepare the UI for the background task. \n\nIn the `onPostExecute()` method, you should dismiss the `ProgressDialog` if it's still showing. This method is called after `doInBackground()`, and it runs on the UI thread, so it's the right place to update the UI based on the results of the background task. \n\nThe `ApplicationInfo.loadIcon` API is used to get the icon Drawable for this application package. It's called in the `onPostExecute()` method to get the icon for each installed application."
