The read method returns the total number of bytes read into the buffer, or -1 if there is no more data because the end of the stream has been reached. The FileOutputStream.write method is used to write bytes from the buffer to the file. The loop continues until there is no more data to read from the input stream, at which point the FileOutputStream is closed."
