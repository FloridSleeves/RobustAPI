Then, we create a DataOutputStream object 'dos' and pass 'baos' to its constructor. This way, we can use the methods of both classes. We write an integer and a byte array to the 'dos'. After writing all data, we call the flush() method to ensure that all data is written out to the underlying output stream. Finally, we call the toByteArray() method on 'baos' to get the byte array."
