The value byte is returned as an int in the range 0 to 255. If no byte is available because the end of the stream has been reached, the value -1 is returned. In the code, we are reading the file byte by byte and converting each byte to a hexadecimal string using String.format() method. The \"%02x\" format specifier is used to print at least 2 digits, prepending it with 0 if necessary. This way, even if the hexadecimal representation of the byte is a single digit, it will still print it as two digits, for example, 01 instead of 1."

I want to read it in to a variable like you would see in a hex editor i.e 00 11 21 31 no single numbers as i need to scan the whole file and look for patterns which I know how to do I'm just stuck on this :/so in short i need a variabe to contain the two hex characters i.e int temp = 01 not int temp = 0 , I hope this all makes sense, I'm a little confused as it's 3am!If anyone knows how to do this I would be most greatful, p.s thanks for the help in advance this site has saved me loads of research and have learnt a lot!Many thanks.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
