Also, you were not shuffling the lines to unsort them. \n\nIn the revised code, we first read all lines from the input file into an ArrayList. Then we use the Collections.shuffle method to randomly rearrange the lines. After that, we loop through the shuffled lines and write each one to the output file using PrintWriter.write. We add a line separator after each line to ensure that the lines are written to the file correctly. Finally, we close both the PrintWriter and the Scanner after we're done with them."

It inputs a file of a list of countries that is sorted alphabetically, it outputs an unsorted file with lines rearranged randomly.My first main class looks like this:package assignment3;import java.io.PrintWriter;import java.io.File;import java.util.Scanner;public class Assignment3 {`public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception{    Scanner stdIn = new Scanner(new File(\"C:/Users/Vicki/Desktop/CountrySortedFormat.txt\"));    PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(\"C:/Users/Vicki/Desktop/CountryUnsortedFormat.txt\");    String[] line = new String[238];    while (stdIn.hasNextLine()){            for (int k = 0; k <= line.length-1; k++){            line[k]=stdIn.nextLine();            out.println(line[k]);            out.close();        }    }  }}My code doesn't have any visible problems but I tried printing out the array and got an array of \"null\". Am I doing something wrong?EDIT: changed PrintWriter file name to CountryUnsortedFormat\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
