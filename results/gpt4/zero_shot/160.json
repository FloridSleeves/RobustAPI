It's often better to refactor your code to separate concerns into different classes, each with a single responsibility. This makes your code easier to understand, maintain, and test.\n\nIn the case of InputStream.read, you're mocking a method from a system class. This is a common scenario where partial mocking is acceptable, because you can't refactor system classes. However, you should still aim to minimize the amount of logic in your code that directly depends on system classes, to make your code easier to test.\n\nIf you find that you can't mock an object because you only want to mock a few methods, this is another sign that your class is doing too much. Consider whether you can refactor your code to move the methods you want to mock into a separate class. If this isn't possible, you might need to use a partial mock as a last resort. However, be aware that this can make your tests more complex and harder to maintain."

However, often i find writing partial mocks time consuming, and it does not feel 'right'.I'd say its a design fault as my class I try to mock has multiple concerns into one, therefore I should create seperate classes in order to seperate concerns.What do you think? Is partially mocking a good or bad thing? And, if good/bad, why? What would you suggest if you notice you cannot mock the object because you only want to mock a few methods?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
