In Java, Strings are objects and have additional metadata associated with them, such as a hash code, a count of the number of characters, and a reference to a character array. This additional metadata increases the size of the String object in memory.\n\nMoreover, Java uses Unicode and each character in a String is stored as 2 bytes (16 bits), which allows it to represent a greater range of characters than ASCII. So, if your XML file is encoded in ASCII, when it's loaded into a String in Java, each character will take up 2 bytes instead of 1, effectively doubling the size.\n\nOn the other hand, C++ strings are closer to arrays of characters, and do not have the additional overhead that Java Strings do. Also, C++ typically uses ASCII for character representation, so each character takes up only 1 byte.\n\nThe `String.getBytes()` method in Java returns a byte array representing the String, where each character is represented by its byte value in the default character set of the platform. This can be used to get a more accurate representation of the size of the String content, but it still won't account for the additional overhead of the String object itself."
