The `hasNext()` method always returns true because the Fibonacci sequence is infinite. The `next()` method calculates the next Fibonacci number by adding the current number and the previous number, then updates the current and previous numbers for the next iteration. This way, the Fibonacci sequence is generated in a lazy way, and each number is only calculated once. However, please note that this iterator does not support accessing elements by index. If you need to access elements by index, you might need to use a List to store the calculated numbers. But in that case, the calculation will not be lazy anymore."

To be useful, such collection should keep already once counted elements and get() them without recounting. The counting of elements should happen in lazy way, at first need. Thus, no member will have to be calculated more than once. In such way we'll a structure that will look like a recursively defined sequence, and will be fast and reusable. When I started to study Java 8 I thought that Stream works in that way. But it does not, for the stream cannot be used twice.I thought about the following construction:IntStream fi;fi=IntStream.iterate(0, i -> fi[i-1]+fi[i-2]);But that way it won't work - I can't get an item from the stream by index.The other problem is that if I'll later go along the stream, it will be consumed and I can't use it repeatedly. If I copy the stream to List, it is not lazy anymore.As a result, I need some construction that I can address by index. As fibo(i). Edit. Obviously, the solution cannot be a stream, for the stream cannot be used twice. I don't want to repeat all calculations on every call to F(i).\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
