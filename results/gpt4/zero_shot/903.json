In the given code, the 'message' string variable is not thread-safe either. If there are simultaneous calls to the TestServlet class, the 'message' string variable may be overwritten by another thread before it is written to the OutputStream, which can lead to inconsistent data. To make it thread-safe, you can use the 'synchronized' keyword to ensure that only one thread can access the block of code at a time. In the updated code, the 'synchronized' keyword is used to make the 'message' string variable and the OutputStream operation atomic, which means it will be safe from concurrent thread interference."
