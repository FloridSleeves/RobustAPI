The TIFF header has been replace by a specific one but the image bytes are exactly the same as in a TIFF file.EDIT :Thanks to haraldK, I can finally create a TIFF header. But I can't open the image, maybe it is because of the compression : \"M2 = Modified Read Code II (MRII), i.e., fax group 4\". Here is the header that I created :SubFileType (1 Long): ZeroImageWidth (1 Long): 210ImageLength (1 Long): 297BitsPerSample (3 Short): 8, 8, 8Compression (1 Short): Group 4 Fax (aka CCITT FAX4)Photometric (1 Short): RGBStripOffsets (1 Long): 306SamplesPerPixel (1 Short): 3RowsPerStrip (1 Short): 297StripByteCounts (1 Long): 187110ResolutionUnit (1 Short): NoneXResolution (72 Rational): YResolution (1 Rational): Unexpected numericDateTime (20 ASCII): 2014:07:12 10:51:51 Software (28 ASCII): Put your software name here ImageDescription (30 ASCII): Put an image description here Should I uncompress the image data before merging the header and the image data ?\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:"
