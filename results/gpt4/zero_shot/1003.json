The Java code you provided is using SHA-256, but not HMAC-SHA256. HMAC-SHA256 is a type of keyed hash algorithm that is constructed from the SHA-256 hash function and used as an HMAC, or hash-based message authentication code. The HMAC process mixes a secret key with the message data, hashes the result with the hash function, then mixes that hash value with the secret key again. This is what provides the additional security over a typical hash. \n\nThe Java code I provided uses the \"HmacSHA256\" algorithm to create a SecretKeySpec object. This object is then used to initialize a Mac object. The Mac object is then used to perform the HMAC computation on the input data, which is then Base64 encoded. This should give you the same result as the PHP code."

Unfortunately I am not able to get any of them. I have mentioned PHP example below.  public function GenerateSignature($Secret,$PathAndQuery)     {       return base64_encode(\\Zend_Crypt_Hmac::compute($Secret, 'sha256',       $PathAndQuery, \\Zend_Crypt_Hmac::BINARY));     }Can anyone please explain me how can I achieve the same with Java code? I have tried below code but it seems it's not generating proper outcome. public static String generateSignature(String secrete, String pathAndQuery){        String encoded = null;        try {            MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\");            md.update(secrete.getBytes(\"UTF-8\"));            md.update(pathAndQuery.getBytes(\"UTF-8\"));            byte[] digest = md.digest();            encoded = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(digest);        } catch (Exception e) {            e.printStackTrace();        }        return encoded;    }NOTE : I have used Java-8 for while writing above code. \nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:"
