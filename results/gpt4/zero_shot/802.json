We first create a FileWriter object, passing the name of the log file and a boolean indicating that we want to append to the file rather than overwrite it. We then create a PrintWriter object, passing the FileWriter object to the constructor. We use the write method of the PrintWriter object to write a log message to the file. Finally, we close the PrintWriter object to ensure that the log message is actually written to the file. If an IOException is thrown at any point, we print the stack trace to help with debugging."
