The `compress` method takes a JSON string as input, converts it to bytes using `getBytes` method, compresses it and returns the compressed byte array.\n\nIn the Javascript code, we are using the `Zlib` library to decompress the data. The `decompress` method takes a compressed byte array as input, decompresses it and then converts it back to a string using `TextDecoder`. Please note that you need to include the Zlib library in your Javascript code to use the `Zlib.Inflate` method."

Improve this question                    I have a large amount of data being sent from server to Javascript, which is taking quite a long time to load.I was wondering how I can implement compression at server and decompression in Javascript. I would appreciate any help.\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:"
