To fix this, you should create the PrintWriter object outside of the loop. Then, inside the loop, you can use the PrintWriter.write method to write the random number to the file. The write method takes a String as an argument, so you need to convert the random number to a String using Integer.toString. Also, you need to add a newline character (\"\\n\") after each number to ensure that each number is written on a new line. Finally, you should close the PrintWriter after the loop to ensure that all changes are saved to the file."
