The hasNext() method is used to check if there are more elements in the iteration. If there are, the next() method is called to get the next element and add it to the result of the recursive call to the summation method. If there are no more elements, 0 is returned. This solution does not require an index."

Thanks.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
