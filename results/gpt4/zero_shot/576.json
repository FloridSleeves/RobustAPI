You are creating a Queue object of type Transaction and collection is the reference to that object. \n\nThe second part of the code is a for-each loop, which is a simpler form of the for loop designed for iterating over arrays or collections. It is used to traverse each element in the collection. \n\nHere, 'Transaction t' is a reference variable that points to each element in the collection one by one. 't' is not a reference to the object Transaction, but a reference to each individual Transaction object stored in the collection. \n\nThe 'Iterator.next' method is implicitly called in the background when the for-each loop is executed. It is used to get the next element from the collection. In each iteration of the loop, 't' points to the next Transaction object in the collection until all objects have been traversed. \n\nThe 'StdOut.println(t)' statement is used to print the details of each Transaction object. The specific details that get printed depend on how the 'toString()' method is implemented in the Transaction class."

Correct? Then the second bit of code is what confuses me. We are looping to print whats in the queue but i'm not sure i understand how this works. collection points to the Queue of type Transaction. It looks like we are creating a reference t to the object Transaction and doing something with it to the reference collection. Pretty confused.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
