Then, in the onCreate() method, we set the content view of the activity and check if any of the three numbers are equal. If they are, we generate new random numbers until all three numbers are different. The Activity.setContentView API is used to set the layout resource to be used by the activity."

I was able to do the random number using the math.rand() but I am trying to make sure that the three numbers do not match. I did a work around using while and if statements, but I was looking to see if there is a one line of command to do this, so that I can put it right under th activity class so that it's public var. and in that area (activity) I can't use while and if statements, I only can in onCreate due to the void or something. Thank you in advance for your help, and will vote for any help or idea that will lead to finding any info about this. \nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer:"
