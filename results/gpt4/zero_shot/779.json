However, FileOutputStream does not support setting the character encoding. To set the character encoding to UTF-8, you need to use OutputStreamWriter. OutputStreamWriter is a bridge from character streams to byte streams: Characters written to it are encoded into bytes using a specified charset. The charset that it uses may be specified by name or may be given explicitly, or the platform's default charset may be accepted. In this case, we specify \"UTF-8\" as the charset."
