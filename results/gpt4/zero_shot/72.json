The writeBytes() method is used to write String values in ASCII format. The write() method is used to write byte array. The writeInt() and writeFloat() methods are used to write int and float values in binary format respectively. This class provides a more efficient way to write data in both formats compared to using ByteBuffer and FileOutputStream."

But it should be shorter since in I'm writing less data.I've looked at other Java classes, and it seems to me that they are either only for ASCII writing, or only for Binary writing.Would you have any other proposition for this problem ?\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:"
