So when you call `next()` on this new Iterator, it will always return the first element.\n\nIf you want to get the next element in the iteration, you should use the same Iterator instance throughout your loop. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```java\nIterator<CStick> iterator = testCStickChart.iterator();\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\n    CStick localCStick = iterator.next();\n    System.out.println(localCStick.getEPIC());\n    if (iterator.hasNext()) {\n        System.out.println(\"next EPIC is \" + iterator.next().getEPIC());\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this code, we're creating an Iterator instance before the loop and using it to get the next element in each iteration. We also added a check to make sure there is a next element before trying to access it, to avoid a `NoSuchElementException`."

I expected it to give me the next CStick in my CStickChart (hence when I call the getEPIC I was expecting it to give me the next EPIC along).// Print the EPIC out of the Array using the iteratorfor (CStick localCStick : testCStickChart) {  System.out.println(localCStick.getEPIC());  //The below line doesn't return the next CStick and I'm not sure why  System.out.println(\"next EPIC is \" + testCStickChart.iterator().next().getEPIC());}Please could someone explain why this is not the case (it always returns the first EPIC)\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
