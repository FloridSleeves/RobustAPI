On Windows, this is \"\\r\\n\". However, when you explicitly put \"\\n\" in the string, it's treated as a normal character and not a line separator. So, you should use the PrintWriter#write method instead, which does not automatically append any line separator. You need to manually add the \"\\r\\n\" to ensure it works correctly on Windows. Also, don't forget to close the PrintWriter after you're done with it to ensure all changes are written to the file."
