We then use the `Iterator.next` method to iterate over each service. For each service, we check if it supports the message (this could be a method in your `SocialNetworkService` interface that checks if the service can handle the message based on its content). If it does, we transmit the message using that service. This way, you can add as many implementations of `SocialNetworkService` as you want, and the code will automatically use the ones that can handle the message."

I.e if i dont support dont transmit...c). i could have annotaded injection i.e@Twitter, @Facebook all in a controller bean and then select the appropriate but my service implementations number will grow....Thanks in advance,Dimitri\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
