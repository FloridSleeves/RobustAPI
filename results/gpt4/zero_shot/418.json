For example, \"aaa\" is smaller than \"aab\".\n\n2) The original code was removing every item it iterated over, not just the minimum item. The updated code first finds the minimum item, then resets the iterator and iterates over the items again to find and remove the minimum item. The `break` statement stops the loop once the minimum item is found and removed, assuming each item is unique. If there could be duplicates of the minimum item and you want to remove all of them, you should remove the `break` statement."

I am able to find the minimum item, but I am having trouble removing it.  My code is below.  public Comparable removeMin() {    Iterator<T> it = iterator();    T min = it.next();    while (it.hasNext()) {        T next = it.next();        if (min.compareTo(next) > 0)            min = next;        it.remove();    }    System.out.println(min);    return min;}I have the print statement there just to verify that it is in fact getting the minimum item.  The code in main looks like this.public static void main(String[] args) {  Bag<String> sbag = new Bag<String>();    sbag.add(\"Noriko\");    sbag.add(\"Peter\");     sbag.add(\"Buddy\");    sbag.add(\"Mary\");    sbag.removeMin();  }When I run the sbag.removeMin(); command, the console prints \"Buddy\" which tells me that it is choosing \"Buddy\" as the min item.  However, if I instead populate sbag with integers, it always prints the smallest integer, which indicates to me I have my code correct in that regard.I have two questions.1). When passing a list of strings such as above, how does Java determine which is smallest?2). How can I fix my code so that it not only finds the minimum item, but also removes it?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
