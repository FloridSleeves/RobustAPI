The method printTree is modified to take a StringBuilder as a parameter, which is used to build the string representation of the tree. This is more efficient than concatenating strings, especially for large inputs. The method is also modified to not return a string, but instead modify the StringBuilder directly. This avoids creating unnecessary temporary strings. The check for whether to append a comma is moved inside the loop and only done if there are more children to process. This avoids appending a comma after the last child."

However, I need to store its serialization in a variable a calling class. eg.     DomTree<String> a = Data.createTreeInstance(\"very_large_file.xml\");    String x = a.toString();I've written method which serves the purpose exactly how I need it, but on very large inputs it takes forever (20mins on a 100MB xml file) - I have timed the methods and building the tree from the xml file is quick, but calling toString() as shown above is very slow.@Overridepublic String toString(){    return printTree(this);}public String printTree(AbstractTree<E> tree){    if (tree.isLeaf()){        return tree.getNodeName();    }else{        String tStr = tree.getNodeName() + \"(\";        int i = 0;        Iterator<AbstractTree<E>> child = tree.getChildren().iterator();        while (i < tree.getChildren().size() - 1){            tStr += printTree(child.next()) + \", \";            i++;        }        tStr += printTree(child.next()) + \")\";        return tStr;        }}I'm guessing it is to do with the way the string is built up rather than how the tree is traversed?  Is there a better way to do this?UPDATE:  Following the example of Skaffman, the following code give outOfMemoryError for very large input.@Overridepublic String toString(){    StringBuilder buffer = new StringBuilder();    printTree(this, buffer);    return buffer.toString();}public String printTree(AbstractTree<E> tree, StringBuilder buffer){    if (tree.isLeaf()){        return tree.getNodeName();    }else{        buffer.append(tree.getNodeName());        buffer.append(\"(\");        int i = 0;        Iterator<AbstractTree<E>> child = tree.getChildren().iterator();        while (i < tree.getChildren().size() - 1){            buffer.append(printTree(child.next(), buffer));            buffer.append(\", \");            i++;        }        buffer.append(printTree(child.next(), buffer));         buffer.append(\")\");        return buffer.toString();       }}UPDATE: Works perfectly now, using Skaffmans example\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
