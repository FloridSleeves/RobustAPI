We use Google Guava's Iterables.cycle method to create an infinite loop over the hosts. This way, we can keep cycling through the hosts in a round-robin fashion. When we want to send a job, we simply call the sendJob method. This method will iterate over the hosts until it finds one that is not busy (i.e., its status is ACCEPTED), at which point it will send the job to that host and break out of the loop. This ensures that the load is evenly distributed among the hosts."

Currently I simply iterate thru the list looking and establish comms with a host to check its not busy. If not I will send a job to it. This approach tends to mean that the first host in the list tends to get hot constanly with the load not balanced properly with the rest of the available hosts.in pseudocode ..for (Host h : hosts) {    //checkstatus    if status == job accepted break;}I'd like to balance this load properly between the hosts i.e first time host one is used 2nd time the method is used host 2. Just wondering that the most elegant solution to this is ??ThanksW\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
