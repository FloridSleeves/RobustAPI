In Java, the backslash is an escape character, so you need to use two backslashes to represent a single backslash. Therefore, you should use \"\\\\r\\\\n\" instead of \"\\r\\n\". \n\nAlso, you are only writing the first element of the split string to the file. If you want to write all the elements, you should loop through the array and write each element. \n\nThe PrintWriter.write() method is used to write a string to the output stream. Unlike the println() method, it does not append a newline character at the end, so you need to do this manually if you want each element on a new line."

Now I'm using the .split() function to try separate the tweets from one another but it would seem that \\r\\n09/19/14 isn't an appropriate split string? Here is the code:String[] value = line.split(\"\\r\\n09/19/14\");PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"hello.txt\", \"UTF-8\");writer.println(value[0]);writer.close();The text file 'hello', when I open it is just the following string again, \"TweetJSONObject\\r\\n09/19/14TweetJSONObject\". Any ideas as to where I'm going wrong?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
