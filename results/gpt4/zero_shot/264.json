Then it creates an ArrayList called masterList. It iterates through the HashSet, and for each Integer, it checks if it is present in all the ArrayLists in the HashMap using the Iterator.next method. If it is, it adds the Integer to the masterList. The masterList will then contain all the numbers that appear in each list."

But I'll still post it just in case it is useful for someone else.But of course if you have a better way please do let me know.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
