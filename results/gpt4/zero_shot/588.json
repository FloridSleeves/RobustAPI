However, Java provides the Collections.sort() method to sort a list in ascending order. After sorting the list, you can use the List.get() method to retrieve an element at a specific index. In the provided code, we first add elements to the list, then sort the list, and finally print the first element, which is \"A\" after sorting."

Both belong to the Java Collections framework and provide a sorted way to access the elements. However, in my understanding there is no SortedList in Java. You can use java.util.Collections.sort() to sort a list.Any idea why it is designed like that?\nPlease using this api: List.get.\nAnswer:"
