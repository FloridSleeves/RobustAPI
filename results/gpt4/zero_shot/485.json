For each object, we check if its first attribute (retrieved by `current.getFirstAttribute()`) is already in the map. If it's not, we add it to the map. This way, we ensure that only the first occurrence of each unique first attribute is kept. Finally, we return a new list containing the values from the map, which are the unique objects."

In code:private void example() {    List<SomeType> listWithDuplicates = new ArrayList<SomeType>();    /*     * create the \"duplicate\" objects. Note that both attributes passed to      * the constructor are used in equals(), though for the purpose of this      * question they are considered equal if the first argument was equal     */    SomeType someObject1 = new SomeObject1(\"hello\", \"1\");    SomeType someObject2 = new SomeObject1(\"hello\", \"2\");    List<SomeType> listWithoutDuplicates = removeDuplicates(listWithDuplicates)    //listWithoutDuplicates should not contain someObject2}private List<SomeType> removeDuplicates(List<SomeType> listWithDuplicates) {    /*     * remove all but the first entry in the list where the first constructor-     * arg was the same     */}\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
