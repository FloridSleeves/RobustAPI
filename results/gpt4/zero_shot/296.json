Each thread is responsible for sorting its own array of words. Once a thread has finished sorting its array, it adds the sorted words to a shared list. We then use the Iterator.next API to iterate over the sorted list and print out the words. The Iterator.next API is used to retrieve the next element in a collection. In this case, it is used to retrieve the next word in the sorted list of words."

My program then takes the array, splits into the amount of threads passed as an argument in the terminal, and gives each thread a piece of the array to sort, then stores all the threads in an array. Now, what I need some help with is this:I now want to take threads, as soon as they are done (Ie. if two are done before the others, they start to merge then wait for more). Think of it like braiding. I know how to write the sorting code for the merging, but what I hope you can help me with is this: How do I manage the threads? I know what wait() and notify() does, but I can't seem to be able to wrap my ead around what exactly I would need to do to make them merge into one array. Should I:Create a method inside the thread-class that merges the arrays?Create a new thread for every other thread that is done, pass the two sorted word-arrays as a parameter, and let that thread do the sorting?Something else I haven't thought of. I hope this was clear enough, and of good enough quality as the questions should be.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
