When a client connects, it sends a cross-domain policy XML string to the client. The `getBytes()` method is used to convert the XML string to bytes before sending it to the client. This is necessary because the `PrintWriter` class's `println` method requires a byte array as input. The XML string allows any domain to access the server on port 6000. After sending the XML string, the server closes the connection to the client."

I'm trying to achieve this with a socket connection. (port 6000)Now, at first flash was able to connect, but it just sends <policy-file-request/>. After this nothing happens.Now, some people at Kirupa suggested to send an cross-domain-policy xml as soon as any connection is established from the java side. http://www.kirupa.com/forum/showthread.php?t=301625However, my java server just throws the following:End Exception: java.net.SocketException: Software caused connection abort: recv failedI've already spend a great amount of time on this subject, and was wondering if anyone here knows what to do?\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:"
