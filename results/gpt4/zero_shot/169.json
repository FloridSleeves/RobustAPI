It simply blocks until it can read more data, or until the stream is closed. To handle this, you can use a separate thread to read from the InputStream and use a timeout. If the read operation does not complete within the timeout, you can close the InputStream and handle the error. In the provided code, we are using a try-catch block to handle any IOException that might occur while reading from the InputStream or closing it. If an IOException occurs, it is caught and its stack trace is printed. The InputStream is also closed in a finally block to ensure that it is closed even if an exception occurs."

However if my network goes down the the process of reading the file the read method blocks and is never recovers if the network reappears. I was wondering how I should handle this case and should some exception not be thrown if the InputStream goes away. Code is like this. Url someUrl = new Url(\"http://somefile.com\");InputStream inputStream = someUrl.openStream();byte[] byteArray = new byte[];int size = 1024;inputStream.read(byteArray,0,size);So somewhere after calling read the network goes down and the read method blocks. How can i deal with this situation as the read doesn't seem to throw an exception. \nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
