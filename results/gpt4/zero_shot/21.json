You should call super.onCreate(savedInstanceState) before setContentView(R.layout.dish_tag). The setContentView() method is used to set the layout for the activity UI and should be called after the super.onCreate() method. This is because the super.onCreate() method is where the initial state of the activity is created, and it needs to be done before any UI related tasks. The getSupportActionBar() method is used to get a support ActionBar for this activity, and it should be called after setContentView(). This is because the ActionBar is part of the activity's layout, and the layout needs to be set before you can interact with it."
