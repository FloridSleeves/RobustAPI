In the original code, the list 'choices' is being modified while it is being iterated, which is not allowed in Java. \n\nTo avoid this, we can use an Iterator. The Iterator interface provides methods to iterate over any Collection. We can use its next() method to get the next element in the collection. \n\nIn the modified code, we create an Iterator for the 'choices' list. Then, we iterate over the 'choices' list using the hasNext() and next() methods of the Iterator. For each word, we create a copy of the 'choices' list, add the word to the 'chosen' list, remove the word from the copy of the 'choices' list, and then call the subsets method. This way, we are not modifying the 'choices' list while iterating over it, thus avoiding the ConcurrentModificationException."
