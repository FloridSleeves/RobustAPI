The `File.separator` is used to add the system-dependent default name-separator character to the path, making the code more portable. The method returns `true` if and only if the directory was created, along with all necessary parent directories; `false` otherwise. If the directory creation fails, a message is printed to the console."

So the error has to be in here. But I cant figure out what I did wrong since I am a first-timer with this.   public void makeDirectory(String path, String nameFolder) {    File dir = new File(path + \"\\nameFolder\");    dir.mkdir();}Thank you for your timeEDIT: 'Doesn't work' means no directory is being created.EDIT2:Have been able to make it work thx to Niks Tyagi    public void makeDirectory(String path, String nameFolder) {    File dir = new File(path +\"\\\\\"+ nameFolder);    dir.mkdirs();}\nPlease using this api: File.mkdirs.\nAnswer:"
