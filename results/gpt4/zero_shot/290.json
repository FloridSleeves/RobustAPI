In your case, you are using it to get the next String from your ArrayList<String> named fileContent. The problem with your code is that you are not looping through all the elements in your ArrayList. You are only checking the first element. To fix this, you need to add a while loop that continues as long as there are more elements in your ArrayList. This is done with the Iterator.hasNext() method, which returns true if there are more elements. Also, you should declare your Iterator and token as String type instead of Object to avoid unnecessary casting."

Object token is supposed to be read as 'Table'.        void process() {        Iterator fileIterator = fileContent.iterator();        int state = 0;        Object token = null;        switch (state) {        case 0:            token = fileIterator.next();            if (token.equals(\"Table\")) {                System.out.println(token);                state = 1;            } else {                System.err.println(\"Corrupt file format at state 0: \"+ token);                System.exit(0);            }            break;        }    }This doesn't switch state to 1, instead it prints out:'Corrupt file format at state 0: Table'So it seems as it reads the Object token correctly as 'Table' but not for the statement 'if (token.equals(\"Table\"))'. I have also tried 'if (token == (\"Table\"))'Can somebody help me?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
