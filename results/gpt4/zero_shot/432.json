When you declare an Iterator without a type, it defaults to Iterator<Object>, which is why you're getting an incompatible types error when trying to assign it.next() to a variable of type E. \n\nTo fix this, you need to specify the type of the Iterator when you declare it. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```java\nIterator<E> it = this.iterator();\nE next = it.next();\n```\n\nIn this corrected code, we're declaring an Iterator of type E, so it.next() will return an object of type E, which can be assigned to a variable of type E without causing an incompatible types error."

Iterator it = this.iterator();E next = it.next();next() returns a generic type E and next is of type E. Why is it giving me the error?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
