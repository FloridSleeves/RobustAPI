Instead, you should create the PrintWriter object with the FileWriter object as the parameter. This way, the FileWriter object, which is set to append mode (true), will handle the file writing, and the PrintWriter object will just pass the data to the FileWriter object. Also, use the write method instead of println to write the data. The \"\\n\" at the end of the string is to create a new line."

I know its probably a easy fix... I'm learning.. Thank you!\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
