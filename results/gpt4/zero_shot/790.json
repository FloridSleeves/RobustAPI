If the user approves the file selection, we get the selected file using `chooser.getSelectedFile()`. Then, we create a PrintWriter object, passing a new FileOutputStream created with the selected file. We then write the text to the file using `writer.write(\"Your text goes here\")`. Finally, we close the PrintWriter using `writer.close()`. If the file is not found, a FileNotFoundException is caught and the stack trace is printed."
