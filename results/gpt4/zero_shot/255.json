We then create a ByteArrayOutputStream to which we write the data read from the InputStream. This effectively creates a copy of the data in memory. We then convert this data to a byte array, which can be used to create new InputStreams or to write the data to a file. This way, we don't need to open a new stream to the original source, which could be slow or even impossible if the source is a one-time stream."

Is it possible to copy it somehow?I need to get a image from web, save it locally and then return the saved image. I just thought it would be faster to use the same stream instead of starting a new stream to the downloaded content and then read it again.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
