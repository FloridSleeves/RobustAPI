However, it is not suitable for inlining an external CSS file with a HTML document based on its ID/class attributes. This API is used for tokenizing strings in Java, not for parsing HTML or CSS. \n\nFor your requirement, you might want to look into libraries like Jsoup or Jericho HTML Parser which are designed for parsing and manipulating HTML documents. They can be used to select elements by their ID/class attributes and modify their inline styles. \n\nAs for jStyleParser, it is a CSS parser library. It can parse CSS files, but it does not provide functionality to inline CSS into HTML documents. It can be used in combination with a HTML parser library to achieve your requirement."

I seem to fail to understand if it can do the job of inlining the CSS on the elements from the HTML. The documentation and examples is not what I expected.Is there anyone who can answer that question or does there exist another library for this?Thanks\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
