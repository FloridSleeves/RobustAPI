Then, we create a HashMap to store each word and its count. We iterate over the ArrayList of words, and for each word, we use the Map.get method to get the current count of that word in the HashMap. If the word is not yet in the HashMap (i.e., the count is null), we put the word in the HashMap with a count of 1. If the word is already in the HashMap, we increment the count by 1. Finally, we print out the HashMap, which shows each word and its count."
