The ImageReader is set to read from the ImageInputStream created from the input file. The image is then read into a BufferedImage. The size of the image is halved and a new BufferedImage is created to hold the resized image. The original image is drawn into the new BufferedImage using a Graphics2D object, which is set to use bilinear interpolation for better quality. The resized image is then written to the output file. The Iterator.next method is used to get the ImageReader from the Iterator returned by ImageIO.getImageReaders."
