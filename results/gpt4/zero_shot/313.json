This class has a peek() method that allows you to look at the next element without consuming it. This is achieved by storing the next element in a field (nextElement) and updating it every time next() is called. This way, you can check the next element (to see if it's flagged or not) without consuming it, and without changing the signature of your method. You can use it like this:\n\n```java\nPeekingIterator<String> peekingIterator = new PeekingIterator<>(it);\nwhile (peekingIterator.peek().startsWith(\"*\")) {\n    // process flagged elements\n    String element = peekingIterator.next();\n}\n// pass the iterator to your method\nmethodAcceptingIterator(peekingIterator);\n```\n\nIn this way, the iterator passed to the method will still have the first unflagged element available."

The only way to know that the flagged elements are over, is by noticing that the (k+1)th element is not flagged. The problem is that if I do that, the iterator it will not provide me the first value anymore on the next call to next().I want to pass this iterator to a method as it's only argument and I would like to avoid changing its signarture and it implementation. I know I could do this:    public void methodAcceptingIterator(Iterator<String> it) //current signature   //change it to   public void methodAcceptingIterator(String firstElement, Iterator<String> it)But this looks like a workarround/hack decreasing the elegance and generality of the code, so I don't want to this. Any ideas how I could solve this problem ?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
