Then it gets the top-k indices by sub-listing the first k elements from the sorted indices list. Finally, it uses the Iterator.next API to iterate through the top-k indices and print them out. This approach avoids the use of HashMap and HashSet, and it should be faster because it only sorts the indices, not the scores. The Iterator.next API is used to retrieve each element in the top-k indices list."

(I don't know if this makes a difference since as I mentioned in the other question my arrays are small -50 elements-). If this does not make a difference point it out though.I am not interested in the value per se, only the indices.My question is whether there is a faster approach to go with it?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
