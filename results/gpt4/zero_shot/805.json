We then create a new File object with the name \"db.txt\". We use the createNewFile() method to create the file if it doesn't exist already. If the file is created successfully or if it already exists, we then create a PrintWriter object, passing a FileWriter object with the file and a boolean value of true (which means we want to append to the file rather than overwrite it) to its constructor. We then use a for-each loop to write each string in the array to the file, followed by a newline character. After writing all the strings, we close the PrintWriter. Finally, we create a BufferedReader object to read from the file. We use a while loop to read each line from the file until there are no more lines, printing each line as we read it. After reading all the lines, we close the BufferedReader."

How do I create a new text file (if not existing already), how do I write to it and how do I read from it? Tried to learn it by myself but I've seen so many ways on the Internet and got confused.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
