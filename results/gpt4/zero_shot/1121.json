We use a List to store the words because we don't know the length of the array in advance. We keep reading words from the input until we encounter the word \"okay\". When we encounter \"okay\", we break out of the loop. After that, we convert the List to an array and print out the words. The StringTokenizer.nextToken API is not used in this case because the Scanner.next method is more suitable for reading words from the input."

For example, let's say I wanted my array to read a series of words until it reached the word \"okay\" from std in, print out each word, and then terminate before printing out \"okay\". The length of this array will be unknown, so I am confused on how to do this.     String s  = sc.next();     String[] copy = new String[???];     for( int i = 0; i < copy.length; i++ ){           copy[i] = sc.next();          }\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
