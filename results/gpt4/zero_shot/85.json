This means that TCP does not guarantee that each write will correspond to a single read. In other words, if you write 25 kilobytes in one write operation, it's not guaranteed that you'll receive all 25 kilobytes in one read operation. \n\nThe `DataInputStream.read(byte[] b)` method you're using on the server side does not guarantee that it will fill the entire buffer, it only guarantees that it will read at least one byte. The return value of this method is the actual number of bytes read, and you should use this value to determine how many bytes to process.\n\nTo fix this issue, you should modify your code to handle the case where a single read operation does not read the entire message. You can do this by repeatedly calling `read` until you have received the entire message. \n\nAlso, it's important to note that the `DataOutputStream.write(byte[] b)` method does not automatically flush the output stream. This means that the data may not be sent immediately unless you call `flush`. If you want to ensure that each message is sent immediately, you should call `out.flush()` after each `out.write(message1)`."

The messages I'm sending are 25 kilos with the first 5 bytes containing the count from the client in the form of a string padded with asterisks to maintain a 5 byte length. However after 3 or 4 successful messages the server fails to find the count. Is there something that I am forgetting to consider? My guess is that the server is having trouble keeping up with the client as the number of successful messages varies from 3 - 4 before error.CLIENT SIDE CODE:try{        clientSocket = new Socket(\"192.168.0.15\", SERVER_PORT);           DataInputStream in = new DataInputStream(clientSocket.getInputStream());        DataOutputStream out = new DataOutputStream(clientSocket.getOutputStream());        int messageCounter = 0;        byte [] message1 = new byte[25 * 1024];        byte [] returnMessage1 = new byte[25 * 1024];        byte [] count;        long startTime1 = System.nanoTime();        while (messageCounter < 100000) {            System.out.println(messageCounter);            addCountToMessage(formatCount(messageCounter).getBytes(), message1);            out.write(message1);            in.read(returnMessage1);                 messageCounter ++;            }      }SERVER SIDE CODE: try {      byte [] data = new byte[35 * 1024];      System.out.println(\"STARTING LOOP\");      System.out.println(\"***********************************\");      int messageCounter = 0;      int clientMessageCount = 0;      String clientCountString = \"\";      byte[] clientCount = new byte[5];      while (true){          in.read(data);          clientCount[0] = data[0];          clientCount[1] = data[1];          clientCount[2] = data[2];          clientCount[3] = data[3];          clientCount[4] = data[4];          clientCountString = new String(clientCount);          System.out.println(\"Received Count String: \\\"\" + clientCountString + \"\\\"\");          clientCountString = clientCountString.replace(\"*\", \"\");          clientMessageCount = Integer.parseInt(clientCountString);          System.out.println(\"Client Count: \" + clientMessageCount + \", Server Count: \" + messageCounter);          out.write(data);          System.out.println(\"***********************************\");          messageCounter ++;      }   }OUTPUT OF SERVER:java TCPServerSTARTING LOOPReceived Count String: \"0****\"Client Count: 0, Server Count: 0Received Count String: \"1****\"Client Count: 1, Server Count: 1Received Count String: \"2****\"Client Count: 2, Server Count: 2Received Count String: \"3****\"Client Count: 3, Server Count: 3Received Count String: \"\"Exception in thread \"Thread-0\" java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: \"\"at java.lang.NumberFormatException.forInputString(NumberFormatException.java:65)at java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Integer.java:481)at java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Integer.java:527)at Connection.run(TCPServer.java:52)\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:"
