This means that you are advancing the iterator twice per loop, so you are skipping every other value. The corrected code first checks if there is a next value and if so, assigns it to `v`. Then, in the loop, it gets the next value, assigns it to `u`, and prints both `v.index1` and `u.index1`. At the end of the loop, it assigns `u` to `v` so that in the next iteration, `v` will be the previous `u`, and `u` will be the new next value. This way, you are not skipping any values and you are correctly getting two consecutive values from the iterator."
