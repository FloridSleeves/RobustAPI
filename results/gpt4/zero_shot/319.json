For instance, There could be 8 players in the map 4 of whom have a score of 10 and the other 4 have a score of 0 how would i split the map in half based on the top scorers and remove the bottom 4? Keep in mind the 8 players is not defined, it could be any number\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
