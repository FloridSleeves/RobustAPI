However, you can achieve a similar effect by using a Map. In the provided code, a Map named `myMethod` is created. Then, in a for loop, the `get` method of the Map is called with a concatenated String (\"get\" + i) as the key. This will return the value associated with the key in the Map, or null if the key does not exist."
