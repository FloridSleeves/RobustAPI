This method blocks until at least one byte of input is available. In the given code, we are seeking to the lastSegment of the file and reading 5 bytes of data into the bytes array. We then convert these bytes into a String and check if it contains the newline character. If it does, we break out of the loop. If it doesn't, we subtract 5 from the lastSegment and repeat the process. This way, we keep moving backwards from the end of the file until we find a newline character."

I also tried looking for \"[\" which all the lines start with, but unless the jumps were perfect the program will not skip \"[\". I tried looking for \"\\r\\n\", System.getProperty(\"line.separator\"), \\r and \\n. Most probably its a dumb mistake, but if I had it and I couldn't find it, then someone else may run into it too.         RandomAccessFile raf = new RandomAccessFile(fileLocation, \"r\");        //Finds the end of the file, and takes a little more        long lastSegment = raf.length() - 5;        //**Looks for the new line character \\n?**        //if it cant find it then take 5 more and look again.        while(stringBuffer.lastIndexOf(\"\\n\") == -1)  {            lastSegment = lastSegment-5;            raf.seek(lastSegment);            //Not sure this is the best way to do it            String seen = raf.readLine();            stringBuffer.append(seen);        }        //Trying to debug it and understand        int location = stringBuffer.lastIndexOf(\"\\n\");        System.out.println(location);        FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(fileLocation);        InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(fis, \"UTF8\");        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);        br.skip(lastSegment);        System.out.println(\"br.readLine() \" + br.readLine());}The idea from the code comes from Quickly read the last line of a text file?The file I use is thishttp://www.4shared.com/file/i4rXwEXz/file.htmlThanks for the help, and if you see any other places where my code could be improve let me know\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:"
