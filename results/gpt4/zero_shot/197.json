The `InputStream.read` method is used to read the output of the executed command from the SSH server. The `read` method reads up to `tmp.length` bytes of data from the input stream into an array of bytes. An attempt is made to read as many as `tmp.length` bytes, but a smaller number may be read. The number of bytes actually read is returned as an integer. This method blocks until input data is available, the end of the stream is detected, or an exception is thrown."
