Since the HashMap is of type Object, Object, the returned values need to be cast to Long before the longValue() method can be used. The casting is done by enclosing the get method in parentheses and prefixing it with (Long). This tells the compiler to treat the returned Object as a Long. The longValue() method is then used to convert the Long object to a primitive long value, which can be added together."

But I was wondering if there was a way of getting the above to work without splitting it up, and if it does need casting (which I'm sure it does) where to put it?EDITNot that it changes anything, but for those who'd like to know more, the answers that I have received do solve the problems. But the Hash Map I'm using is type Object, Object, though it is more used like String, Object, and it does contain data from a database. Unfortunately I can't change the Hash Map as it comes from a piece of purpose built framework that I cannot change.\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:"
