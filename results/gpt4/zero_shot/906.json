Then, we create a FileOutputStream object, which is a stream for writing data to a File or to a FileDescriptor. We pass the name of the file where we want to write the bytes to the FileOutputStream constructor. Then, we use the write() method of the FileOutputStream to write the byte array to the file. Finally, we close the stream with the close() method. If an IOException occurs during these operations, it is caught and the stack trace is printed."

Closed 10 years ago.I want to write byte array to a file as bytes. e.g. byt[] =\"hello\".getBytes();I want to write the byt to a file , such that I see the contents as bytes, not as \"hello\".How can I do that?\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:"
