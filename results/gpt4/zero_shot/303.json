We add 1 to this position and use the modulus operator with the length of the enum to ensure that we cycle back to the first enum constant after the last one. The `Iterator.next` API is not directly used here because enums in Java do not inherently support the Iterator interface. However, the `next()` method we've defined here serves a similar purpose, allowing you to cycle through the enum constants."
