After reading the entire file, the Scanner for the first file is closed. Then, the filename for the second file is taken as input. A PrintWriter object is created for the second file and the entire content of the StringBuilder object, which contains the uppercase content of the first file, is written to the second file using the PrintWriter.write method. Finally, the PrintWriter object is closed to ensure that all the changes are saved to the file."
