It first opens the file and gets the first sheet from the workbook. It then uses an Iterator to go through each row in the sheet. For each row, it gets another Iterator to go through each cell in the row. The `next()` method of the Iterator is used to get the next row or cell. The cell value is then printed to the console. You can replace the print statement with your own logic to process the cell value."
