The StringTokenizer class allows us to break a string into tokens. We create an instance of StringTokenizer with the string passed as a parameter. Then we call the nextToken() method twice to skip the first two tokens and then call it a third time to get the third token. This third token is then returned by the method."

These are the instructions:Write a class called SpecialToken that has a static method called thirdToken. Thismethod should return as a String, the third token of a String that you pass as a parameter. You may assume that spaces will serve as delimiters.This is what I have so far but honestly I am stumped at what the parameter should be and how to return the third token! I was thinking I could do something like nextToken() until the third.public class SpecialToken {    public static String thirdToken() {    }}\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
