In this case, we are using the comma as the delimiter to split the string into two parts. The `nextToken()` method is used to get the next token from the string. The `trim()` method is used to remove any leading or trailing spaces from the tokens. So, after executing this code, `one` will contain \"16.82080560\" and `two` will contain \"96.13055810\"."
