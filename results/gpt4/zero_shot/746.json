The method writes a string to the output stream, converting each character to a byte using the platform's default character encoding. The PrintWriter.println method you were using before also writes a string to the output stream, but it additionally writes a line separator at the end. However, both methods should write spaces correctly. If only the first character is being written, it may be due to some other issue in your code or environment."

Following is my code:String abc = request.getParameter(\"textAreaField\"); //String is \"a b c\" (with spaces)String fileA = dir + \"/A\";PrintWriter fileWriterA = new PrintWriter(new FileOutputStream(fileA,true));fileWriterA.println(abc);fileWriterA.close();The problem I am having here is while writing to the file \"A\" in the directory \"dir\" only \"a\" from String abc will be written and the rest after the space is not written. String abc here in the code is coming from a textarea in html and I have the above code in my servlet. I am not able to understand why it won't write the string with spaces to file. I think it should. I have also checked by printing the String abc and it does print the string \"a b c\" (with spaces). But it won't print that to file. Is there a problem with my code? Any help would be appreciated.Thanks in advance.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
