This method creates the directory named by this abstract pathname, including any necessary but nonexistent parent directories. The method returns `true` if and only if the directory was created, along with all necessary parent directories; `false` otherwise. In the provided code, we first try to create the directory. If the directory is successfully created, we then proceed to create the file. If the directory creation fails, we log an error message."

The device is Xperia Ion with Android version 4.0.4. What's wrong about it and how can I fix it?Edit: I had tried to create folders by some applications, like File Manager.And they also failed to create although the sdcard is writable and readable.I think my phone has some \"protections\" which do not allow me to create folders in sd card.But it's funny that my phone allows me to create files instead.public boolean isExternalStorageWritable() {    String state = Environment.getExternalStorageState();    if (Environment.MEDIA_MOUNTED.equals(state)) {        return true;    }    return false;}/* Checks if external storage is available to at least read */public boolean isExternalStorageReadable() {    String state = Environment.getExternalStorageState();    if (Environment.MEDIA_MOUNTED.equals(state) ||            Environment.MEDIA_MOUNTED_READ_ONLY.equals(state)) {        return true;    }    return false;}\nPlease using this api: File.mkdirs.\nAnswer:"
