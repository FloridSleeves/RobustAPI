When you run your program, you can specify the file name as an argument. The `args[0]` will get the first argument from the command line which is your file name. Then, we create a `RandomAccessFile` object with this file name. The `read` method is used to read the content of the file into a byte array `a`. The `in.length()` method is used to determine the size of the byte array based on the size of the file. Finally, we close the `RandomAccessFile` object using the `close` method."

The code is as followsRandomAccessFile in = new RandomAccessFile('BOT.GRD', \"r\");in.read(a);Now I want to choose file dynamically rather than providing directly as above. I tried a lot and I was unable to do that. Can any one help me on this?\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:"
