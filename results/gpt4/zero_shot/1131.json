For each line, we create a StringTokenizer object and use the nextToken() method to break the line into tokens. The hasMoreTokens() method is used to check if there are more tokens available in the current line. If there are, we print the token and continue to the next one. This process is repeated until all lines in the file have been read. The BufferedReader is then closed in the finally block to ensure that the resource is freed even if an exception occurs."

I use PrintWriter, BufferedWriter and FileWriter as shown belowpublic void writeToFile(String FileName){    PrintWriter pw = null;    try {        pw = new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(FileName)));        for(Cars car : list){            pw.println(car.getType());            pw.println(car.getMaxSpeed());            pw.println(car.getOwner());            pw.println();            pw.flush();        }        pw.close();    }    catch(IOException ex){        System.err.println(ex);    }}Now how can I read this data from file? I tried to use InputStreamReader, BufferedReader and FileInputStream, but my NetBeans shows me an error message    public void readFromFile() throws IOException {        InputStreamReader fr = null;        try {            fr = new InputStreamReader(new BufferedReader(new FileInputStream(new FileReader(\"c:\\\\cars.txt\"))));            System.out.println(fr.read());        } catch (Exception ex) {            System.out.println(ex.getMessage());        } finally {            fr.close();        }    }  What is wrong with this method?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
