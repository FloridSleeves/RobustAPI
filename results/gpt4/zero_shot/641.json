In this case, the key is 'element', which represents a rounded double value from the array. The value is a BigDecimal object representing the frequency of the double value in the array. The method 'add' is then called on this BigDecimal object to increment the frequency by 1. This updated frequency is then put back into the map with the same key, effectively updating the frequency count of the double value in the array. This process is repeated for each double value in the array, allowing the method to keep track of the frequency of each value. The method then uses this frequency information to find the mode of the array, degrading the precision as necessary to meet the frequency requirement."

If I had a frequency requirement of 4 it would return 4 as my mode.I do have a set of code that is working the way I want, and returning what I am expecting, but I feel like there should be a more efficient way to accomplish this, or an existing library that would help me do the same.  Attached is my code, I'd be interested in thoughts / comments on different approaches I should have taken....I have the iterations listed to limit how far  the precision can degrade.public static double findMode(double[] r, int frequencyReq){    double mode = 0d;    int frequency = 0;    int iterations = 4;    HashMap<Double, BigDecimal> counter = new HashMap<Double, BigDecimal>();    while(frequency < frequencyReq && iterations > 0){        String roundFormatString = \"#.\";        for(int j=0; j<iterations; j++){            roundFormatString += \"#\";        }        DecimalFormat roundFormat = new DecimalFormat(roundFormatString);        for(int i=0; i<r.length; i++){            double element = Double.valueOf(roundFormat.format(r[i]));            if(!counter.containsKey(element))                counter.put(element, new BigDecimal(0));            counter.put(element,counter.get(element).add(new BigDecimal(1)));        }        for(Double key : counter.keySet()){            if(counter.get(key).compareTo(new BigDecimal(frequency))>0){                mode = key;                frequency = counter.get(key).intValue();                log.debug(\"key: \" + key + \" Count: \" + counter.get(key));            }        }        iterations--;    }    return mode;}EditAnother way to rephrase the question, per Paulo's comment: the goal is to locate a number where in the neighborhood are at least frequency array elements, with the radius of the neighborhood being as small as possible. \nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:"
