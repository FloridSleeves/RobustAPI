In your case, you are using it to separate the student ID and the student's answers from each line of the text file. The problem with your code is that you are not updating the 'line' and 'strTkn' inside the while loop. So, it's always pointing to the first line and hence, you are not able to read the next lines. To fix this, you need to update 'line' and 'strTkn' inside the while loop. This way, for each iteration, it will read the next line and create a new StringTokenizer for that line."

You may have recently seen a post by me looking for help, but I did it wrong before, so I am going to start fresh and begin at the basics.I am trying to read a text file that looks like this:FTFFFTTFFTFT  3054 FTFFFTTFFTFT  4674 FTFTFFTTTFTF  ... etcWhat I need to do is put the first line into a String as the answer key.Next, I need to create an array with the student ID (the first numbers).Then, I need to create an array that is parallel to the student ID that contains the student's answers.Below is my code, and I can't quite figure out how to get it to work like this, and I was wondering if someone could help me out with it.public static String[] getData() throws IOException {      int[] studentID = new int[50];      String[] studentAnswers = new String[50];      int total = 0;      String line = reader.readLine();      strTkn = new StringTokenizer(line);      String answerKey = strTkn.nextToken();      while(line != null) {        studentID[total] = Integer.parseInt(strTkn.nextToken());        studentAnswers[total] = strTkn.nextToken();        total++;      }    return studentAnswers;    }So at the end of the day, the array structure should look like:studentID[0] = 3054studentID[1] = 4674... etcstudentAnswers[0] = FTFFFTTFFTFTstudentAnswers[1] = FTFTFFTTTFTFThanks :)\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
