Instead, you should use an Integer array since your keys are of Integer type. This way, you can directly compare the elements of the array with any integer. Also, you need to increment the index 'l' in your while loop to store the keys in the next index of the array. The Iterator.next() method is used to retrieve the next element in the iteration, in this case, the next key in the set of keys."

I have written the following code , I have a hashmap named map, it includes integer keys and double values :    Set<Integer> keys = sorted_map.keySet();    Object[] weel = new Object[keys.size()];    Iterator it = keys.iterator();    int l = 0;    while(it.hasNext())    {        weel[l] = it.next();    }Now I have an array that includes the keys of my map. but now I need to compare these keys with some integer. for example :                if(weel[1] == 5) but as the weel type is Object, I can not do the above and also I cannot cast it to int. how can I do this? is it possible?  \nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
