First, we convert the response string to bytes and then write the length of the byte array to the output stream. This is followed by writing the actual byte array. This ensures that the entire response is sent as a single unit.\n\nOn the client side, we use `DataInputStream` to read the incoming message. We first read the length of the incoming message, then read the message itself into a byte array of the appropriate size. This ensures that we read the entire message, even if it is very large. After that, we convert the byte array back to a string and parse it as JSON. This should prevent the `JsonSyntaxException` you were seeing, as the entire JSON string will be read."
