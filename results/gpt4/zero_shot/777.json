We first create a PrintWriter object, passing a FileWriter object initialized with the name of the file we want to write to (\"output.txt\") and a boolean value (true) indicating that we want to append to the file rather than overwrite it. We then use the write method to write lines of text to the file. We can call this method as many times as we need to write as many lines as we want. Finally, we close the PrintWriter object in a finally block to ensure that the file is properly closed even if an exception is thrown."

I want to know is it possible to write a text file throughout the java program till end of the program. I have tried to write a text file using bufferedWriter.write(). First three lines are writing and after that it is not at all writing any text. I have tried flush. My question is,do we have possibility to open file at starting of the program and write lines when ever we need in the middle of the program and as many number of lines and close the file end of the program?If possible, request to share any same code. I am fine with any file write method (File Writer, Buffered writer, file output stream)\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
