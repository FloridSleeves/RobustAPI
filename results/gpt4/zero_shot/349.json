Then, it creates a JLabel with the ImageIcon and adds it to a JPanel. The Iterator.next API is not used in this solution because it is not necessary for adding an image to a JPanel. The Iterator.next API is typically used to iterate over a collection of objects, not for image processing or GUI operations."

NOTE : At first i tried using ImageIcon to add to JPanel but it could not work hence i found this solution which lead to my current problem. I just starting programming in Java.EDIT: Here are the link to the images and I am doing a Java ApplicationI need an alternative to add a image to a JPanel. \nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
