This method first writes two bytes of length information to the output stream, followed by the modified UTF-8 representation of every character in the string. This makes it possible to differentiate between two strings sent into OutputStream. On the server side, you can use the DataInputStream.readUTF() method to read the strings. This method reads in a string that has been encoded using the modified UTF-8 format. The first two bytes read are the length of the string, then it reads in the modified UTF-8 representation of the string."
