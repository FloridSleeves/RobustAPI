In the given code, we are creating an instance of PrintWriter and passing the file name \"jibberish.txt\" to its constructor. The write(\"\") method is used to write an empty string to the file, effectively clearing its contents. Finally, we close the PrintWriter using the close() method to release the resources it is using."

I know that java automatically creates a file with f = new Formatter(\"jibberish.txt\");  s = new Scanner(\"jibberish.txt\");if none already exists. But what if one exists and I want to clear it every time I run the program? That is what I am wondering: to say it again how do I clear a file that already exists to just be blank? Here is what I was thinking: public void clearFile(){    //go through and do this every time in order to delete previous crap    while(s.hasNext()){        f.format(\" \");    }} \nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
