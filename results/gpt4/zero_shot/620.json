In Java, you can't execute methods or statements directly in the class body. They need to be inside a method, constructor, or initializer block. \n\nIn the corrected code, a constructor for the HTMLObjectMap class is created. Inside this constructor, the HashMap is initialized and a value is put into it. \n\nAdditionally, a getParam method is added to retrieve values from the HashMap using the Map.get API. This method takes a key as a parameter and returns the corresponding value from the HashMap."
