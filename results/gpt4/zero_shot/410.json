In the provided code, we first create an Iterator for the Map's entry set. We then store the first entry and remove it from the Map. We then iterate over the rest of the entries. After the iteration, we put the first entry back into the Map, effectively rotating the Map's entries. However, it's important to note that unlike Lists, Maps are not ordered by default (unless you're using a LinkedHashMap or a TreeMap), so the concept of \"rotating\" a Map might not make sense in all contexts."

I have this working, and now I'm looking at expanding it to hold results. At the moment I read all the teams into a list. and use Collections.rotate to rotate the list in order to randomize the fixtures.I was thinking of using a Map to hold the team and number of wins, however rotate doesn't appear to work for map. Is there a similar function that I'm missing, or something that I have overlooked?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
