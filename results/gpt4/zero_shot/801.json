Instead of looping through the second file for each line in the first file, it reads all lines from the first file into a HashSet. Then, it reads the second file line by line and checks if each line is in the HashSet. If it is not, it writes the line to the output file. This approach significantly reduces the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n), where n is the number of lines in the files. The PrintWriter.write method is used to write the lines to the output file."

That is about three months!Is there any ideas to make it done in a much much more less time.Thanks in advance.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
