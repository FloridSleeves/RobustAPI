The `CustomLogger` constructor takes a filename as an argument and creates a `PrintWriter` that appends to the specified file. The `log` method takes a level and a message as arguments and writes them to the file in the format `level: message`. The `close` method is used to close the `PrintWriter` when we're done with it. In the `main` method, we create a `CustomLogger`, log a couple of messages at different levels, and then close the logger."
