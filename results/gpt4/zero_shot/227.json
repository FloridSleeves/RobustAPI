ObjectOutputStream has a method writeObject() which can be used to write an object to the OutputStream. Similarly, ObjectInputStream has a method readObject() which can be used to read an object from the InputStream. \n\nIn the provided code, ObjectOutputStream and ObjectInputStream are created from the OutputStream and InputStream of the socket respectively. Then in the while loop, the 2D char array 'board' is written to the ObjectOutputStream using writeObject() method. After that, flush() method is called to ensure that the array is actually sent over the socket. \n\nOn the receiving side, readObject() method of ObjectInputStream is used to read the 2D char array. Since readObject() returns an object of type Object, it needs to be cast to the correct type (char[][] in this case). \n\nPlease note that the class of the object being sent over the socket needs to implement Serializable interface. In your case, array is a serializable object so you don't need to worry about it. But if you want to send a custom object, you need to make sure that the class of that object implements Serializable interface."

I have the \"board\" stored as a 2 dimensional char array. I want to be able to send and receive this array through Sockets. I am currently using a InputStream and OutputStream to send single bytes. However, I don't think this will work for sending the array. Also, these streams only seem capable of sending int type data. Can someone please explain to me how too send 2 dimensional char arrays over sockets using I/O streams. Example code would be great! Thanks. Current Code:public void communicate() {    try {        OutputStream os = client.getOutputStream();        InputStream is = client.getInputStream();    }    while (gameOver == false) {        char[][] board = new char[3][3];        try {            os.write(board); //this dosen't work, only sends non-array int types.         } catch (IOException e) {            e.printStackTrace();        }    }}\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
