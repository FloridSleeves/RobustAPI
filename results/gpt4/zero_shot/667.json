In this case, the data is a string \"This is a text please work\". The data is written to the OutputStream of the Socket that is connected to the server. After writing the data, the PrintWriter.flush method is called to ensure that the data is actually sent out. This is because PrintWriter uses a buffer to store the data and the flush method forces the data in the buffer to be sent out immediately."
