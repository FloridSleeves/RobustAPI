When we find the word we're looking for, we get the current key and value using the `keySet().iterator().next()` and `get()` methods respectively. We then increment the key and add the new file to the value. We clear the HashMap to ensure it only contains one entry, then put the new key-value pair into the HashMap. This way, the HashMap always contains only one entry, and the key and value are updated each time we find the word."

It begins with \"1\" but when I find the word second time , the key increments and then the put method inserts a new entry with a new keyBut i would like to have only one entry and modify the key.Can this be done?How can i have only one object in a HashMap and modify the key every time?   DocsCollection.put(2,\"foo.txt,hello.txt\"); Thanks, in advance\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:"
