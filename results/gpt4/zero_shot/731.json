Instead, you should call the toString() method on the MyClass object to get a String representation of it, which is a CharSequence. In the provided solution, I have replaced FileWriter with PrintWriter which has a write method that accepts Strings. I have also replaced the while loop with a for-each loop for better readability. The toString() method is called on each MyClass object to get a String representation of it, which is then written to the file. After writing all the elements of a MyClass object, a newline character is written to the file to start a new line for the next MyClass object. Finally, the writer is closed after writing all MyClass objects to the file."

In particular I need to write values. MyClass has the following implementation:public class MyClass {    private Object[] values;//...    @Override    public String toString()       {        String line = \"\";        for (int i=0; i<this.getSize(); i++) {            //if (this.values[i] != null) {                line = line + this.values[i] + \" \";            //}        }        return line;     }}The code is the following:private void saveSolutionToCSV(List<MyClass> solution) {    int columnSize = solution.get(0).getSize();    try {      FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(\"test.csv\");      Iterator result = solution.iterator();      while(result.hasNext()) {         for(int i = 0; i < columnSize; i++) {            CharSequence element = (CharSequence)result.next();             writer.append(element);            if(i < columnSize - 1)             writer.append(',');         }         writer.append('\\n');      }    }    catch(Exception e)    {      e.printStackTrace();    }}And the error message is the following:java.lang.ClassCastException: myPackage.MyClass cannot be cast to java.lang.CharSequenceHow to solve this problem?
