For each iteration, we are dynamically generating the id of the row using the `getIdentifier` method. This method returns the id of the resource (in this case, the TableRow) with the given name in the current package. We then use this id to find the TableRow and set an OnClickListener on it. \n\nInside the OnClickListener, we change the background color of the clicked row and perform any necessary database operations. This way, we avoid writing redundant code for each row and handle all rows in a more efficient manner. \n\nPlease note that this approach assumes that the ids of your TableRows are in the format \"table_row_X\", where X is a number from 0 to 199. If your ids are different, you will need to adjust the code accordingly."

The issue I am trying to figure out is how to make them all able to be clicked without adding 200 lines of TableRow r1 = (TableRow) findViewById(R.id.table_row_1);TableRow r2 = (TableRow) findViewById(R.id.table_row_2);TableRow r3 = (TableRow) findViewById(R.id.table_row_3);TableRow r4 = (TableRow) findViewById(R.id.table_row_4);r1.setOnClickListener(listener);r2.setOnClickListener(listener);r3.setOnClickListener(listener);r4.setOnClickListener(listener);Eventually the rows will take their id's and search the database for the value (I'm going to use each table row as a key for a value in the database to populate a column in the row) but for now I'm just trying to change the background color of the row when each one is clicked.Questions:How can I handle a large number of clickable rows without thousands of lines of redundant code?  Do I need to set an OnClickListener for each row or is there a better method that I am over looking?  Is there a way to do it in the XML maybe?\nPlease using this api: List.get.\nAnswer:"
