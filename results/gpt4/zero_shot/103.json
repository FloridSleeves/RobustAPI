For each line, it writes the line to the output file using a DataOutputStream, appending a LF (\"\\n\") character at the end of each line. This ensures that the output file will always use the Linux EOL character LF, regardless of the EOL character used in the input file."

The server takes an input file from clients. Linux has end of line char LF, while Mac has end of line char CR, andWindows has end of line char CR+LFThe server needs as end of line char LF. Using java, I want to ensure that the file will always use the linux eol char LF. How can I achieve it?\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:"
