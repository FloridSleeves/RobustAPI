The `getInstalledApplications(int)` method of `PackageManager` returns a list of `ApplicationInfo` objects, each representing an application installed on the device. We then loop through this list and log the package name and source directory of each application. Note that the `List.get` API is not directly used here, as the `PackageManager.getInstalledApplications(int)` method already returns a list of installed applications."
