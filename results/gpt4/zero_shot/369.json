The Iterator's 'next()' method is used to get the next 'Person' object in the ArrayList. We then compare this person's coordinates with the coordinates of each volcano in the 'volcanos' ArrayList. If a person is found to be on the same cell as an erupting volcano, the 'remove()' method of the Iterator is called to remove this person from the 'persons' ArrayList. The 'break' statement is used to exit the inner loop once a person is removed, as the same person cannot be removed twice."

More specifically, I have two arraylists, being persons and vulcanos. Both are located in a grid. Each time step, people can move or not (this happens randomly, to the adjecant cells), while volcanos are static during the whole simulation. Volcanos can erupt or not. This is determined by a probability defined by the user. When at a certain timestep a person is located at the same cell as an erupting volcano, this person dies. But I don't know how I can remove that specific person from my array. So far I got the following (is repeated for each time step). for (int j = 0; j < persons.size(); j++) {    for (int k = 0; k < volcanos.size(); k++) {        if ((persons.get(j).getXCoordPerson()) == (volcanos.get(k).getXCoordVolcano())                && (persons.get(j).getYCoordPerson()) == (volcanos.get(k).getYCoordVolcano())                && (volcanos.get(k).getEruptionStatus() == true)) {            // all persons being on the same cell as an erupting volcano die        }    }}\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
