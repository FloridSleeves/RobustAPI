In this case, you would use it to read the SOAP response from the server. The javax.xml.soap.MessageFactory is used to create a new SOAPMessage from the InputStream. The MimeHeaders are used to specify the content type of the SOAP message. The \"Content-Type\" header is set to \"application/xop+xml\" to indicate that the SOAP message is MTOM/XOP encoded. Once the SOAPMessage object is created, you can use its methods to parse the SOAP message."

The problem is that I use plain HTTP to send soap message and javax.xml for parsing response. But some services responds me with mulipart/related and it    requires much more complex logic to parse it (performance matters). So I wonder may I somehow take advantage of apache cxf, apache axiom or any other library for parsing MTOM/XOP SOAP response?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
