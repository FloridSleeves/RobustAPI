In your code, you are creating a new StringTokenizer object 'st' with the string 'test2' which is the substring of the original string 'command' starting from the 7th index. The nextToken() method is then used to get the next token from the string. The first call to nextToken() will give you the email address and the second call will give you the amount. The tokens are separated by space by default."

I dont care about the command token.My code looks like this:String test2 = command.substring(7);StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(test2);String email = st.nextToken();String amount = st.nextToken();\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
