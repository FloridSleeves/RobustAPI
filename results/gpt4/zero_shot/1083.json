In your while loop, you are calling itr.nextToken() twice, but only checking if there is at least one token left. This means that if there is an odd number of tokens in the string, the second call to itr.nextToken() will throw a NoSuchElementException. To fix this, you should add a check for itr.hasMoreTokens() before the second call to itr.nextToken(). This will ensure that there is a token left to retrieve, preventing the NoSuchElementException."
