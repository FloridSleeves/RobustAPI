It does not return null when called multiple times. Instead, it returns the same InputStream object. If you are getting null, it might be because the Socket is closed or not connected. \n\nThe InputStream.read() method is used to read the next byte of data from the input stream. It returns -1 if there is no more data because the end of the stream has been reached. \n\nIf you are trying to read data multiple times from the same Socket, you should keep the InputStream open and read from it whenever you need. If you close the InputStream and then try to open it again, you will get an IOException because the Socket is closed. \n\nIf you want to read data from the Socket again after closing the InputStream, you need to create a new Socket and get a new InputStream from it."
