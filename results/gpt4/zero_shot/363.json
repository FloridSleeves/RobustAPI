Then, we use a for loop to call the next() method on the iterator 'x' times. This effectively moves the iterator to the 'x' position in the list. Now, when you return the iterator, it will start from the 'x' position."

I currently have an iterator that starts at the head:public Iterator<E> iterator( ){    return new ListIterator();}All I have for the other one is:public Iterator<E> iterator(int x ){    return new ListIterator();}I'm not sure how to go about utilizing the given position(x) that won't affect my ListIterator constructor which starts at head. I tried using a for loop to get to \"x\" but realized that wouldn't tell the iterator to start there, so I'm quite stumped. Edit:public ListIterator()        {            current = head; // head in the enclosing list        }\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
