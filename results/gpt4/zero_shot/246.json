This byte array is then written to a ByteArrayOutputStream. This process continues until there is no more data to read from the InputStream (when InputStream.read returns -1). The ByteArrayOutputStream is then converted to a byte array, which is used to create a Bitmap using the BitmapFactory.decodeByteArray method. This approach eliminates the need for the Thread.sleep method because it ensures that all the data is read from the InputStream before attempting to create the Bitmap."

This portion needs to get images from flickr and load them into a texture.  The code I have below is functional most of the time, but it has a Thread.sleep() kludge in between getting the input stream from the connection and the bitmap factory decoding the stream:            URL url = new URL(\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4132/5168797476_7a85deb2be_b.jpg\");            URLConnection con = url.openConnection();            InputStream is = con.getInputStream();            Thread.sleep(250); //What am I actually waiting for?            sourceBitmap = BitmapFactory.decodeStream(is);How do I get around using the sleep() method in favor of something that makes logical sense?I am testing on a samsung galaxy tab not in the emulator\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
