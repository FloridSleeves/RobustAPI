This means that if you're accessing an ArrayList from multiple threads, you need to ensure that access is synchronized to avoid inconsistencies. The List.get method itself is not synchronized. Therefore, if you're using it in a multi-threaded environment, you should use a synchronized block or use a thread-safe collection like Vector or CopyOnWriteArrayList. The code above shows how to use the List.get method in a synchronized block to ensure thread safety."
