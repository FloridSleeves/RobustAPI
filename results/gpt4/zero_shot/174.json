The consumeProcessOutput() method is then called on the Process object, which takes two arguments: the output stream and the error stream. Here, we pass System.out and System.err, which are the standard output and error streams in Java, respectively. This means that the output of the process will be redirected to the standard output, and any errors will be redirected to the standard error. The waitFor() method is then called to make the current thread wait until the process represented by this Process object has terminated. This is necessary because the process is asynchronous and we want to make sure it finishes before the program continues. The InputStream.read API is implicitly used by the consumeProcessOutput method to read the output from the process."

Either a Java or Groovy code example would be fine.foo.bat can take several minutes to run and generates a lot of output, so I would like to see the output as soon as it is generated, rather than having to wait until the process has completed before seeing all the output at once.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
