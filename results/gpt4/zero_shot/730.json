The PrintWriter instance is created outside the loop to avoid overwriting the file in each iteration. After writing all the data, it's important to close the PrintWriter using the close() method. This ensures that all the data is actually written to the file and not just held in memory. The \"\\n\" is added to create a new line after each entry, similar to how println works."

Any ideas?  I do need to overwrite the file as I don't want the original data preserved.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
