When a client connects, we accept the connection, get the InputStream from the socket, and read the bytes sent by the client using InputStream.read(). We then convert these bytes to a string and print the message.\n\nIn the client part, we create a Socket that connects to the server on localhost and port 8000. We get the OutputStream from the socket and write a string message to the server in bytes."

The server is connected to a database.Ok, sorry for that, it's a classic question I'm sure, but I don't know how to start.In a project I worked for they implemented a lot of magic with Proxy.newProxyInstance() to invoke the Glassfish server transparently.I don't want to use a Glassfish server. I just want something simple in plain Java. But the concept of proxies seems pretty cool.Do you have ideas or examples of such thing? How do I write the server part to handle the requests of clients?Thanks in advanceFluminis\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
