In your case, you want to skip the first token which is \"Text\". So, you just call st1.nextToken() once before you call the Graph.checkForCycle() method. This will move the cursor to the next token, effectively skipping the first one. Then, the next three calls to st1.nextToken() will return the last three tokens which are the numbers you need."

Have read a txt file with a buffer reader and trying to use a StringTokenizer.The string i have it like this, where some text first and some numbers after. I only need to numbers, and want to skip \"Text\".Test 2 5 1My code:// Check if the graph contains an cycle    StringTokenizer st1 = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());    Graph.checkForCycle(null, Integer.parseInt(st1.()), Integer.parseInt(st1.nextToken()), Integer.parseInt(st1.nextToken()));      As you can see there are 4 sets here and i want the last 3 to be send with the paramenter when i call the method Graph.checkForCycle()Hope someone can help.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
