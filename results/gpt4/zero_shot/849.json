This code opens the GZIP file with `RandomAccessFile`, seeks to the last 4 bytes of the file, reads those bytes into a byte array, and then converts that byte array into a long value representing the uncompressed size of the GZIP file. Please note that this method only works for GZIP files that are less than 4GB in size, as the GZIP format only stores the uncompressed size as a 32-bit integer."

I want to know the original (uncompressed) length for the gzip data. Although I can read to the end of the GZIPInputStream, then count the number, it will cost much time and waste CPU. I would like to know the size before read it.Is there a similiar method like ZipEntry.getSize() for GZIPInputStream:public long getSize ()Since: API Level 1  Gets the uncompressed size of this ZipEntry.\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:"
