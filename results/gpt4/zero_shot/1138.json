It then uses StringTokenizer to split the line into tokens based on the comma delimiter. The tokens are then stored in an array. The trim() method is used to remove any leading or trailing spaces from the tokens. The while loop continues until there are no more tokens. If an IOException occurs, it is caught and the stack trace is printed."

For example if the line in the file wasDog, blue, largeThen I would like to have 3 different arrays that store one word from the list. So would array 1 would store Dog, array 2 stores blue, and array 3 stores large.Thanks \nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
