Then, it creates an ArrayList to store the positions of '1's. A StringTokenizer is created with the reversed binary string and '0' as the delimiter. The while loop iterates through each token (sequence of '1's) in the reversed binary string. For each token, a for loop iterates through each character in the token. If the character is '1', its position is added to the positions ArrayList. The indexOf() method is used to find the position of the '1', and i is added to account for multiple '1's in a token. After processing a token, it is removed from the reversed binary string to correctly find the positions of '1's in the next token."

Anyways...Take for example, an 8 bit binary representation of a number in String format, \"01110101\". If I reverse the number, I get \"10101110\". If I wanted to find the positions of each 1 and add them to an array, how would I go about doing that? I tried to use indexOf('1'), but it keeps returning 0 or 1 as the index. Edit: By end result, I mean the overall goal I'm trying to accomplish with all of this, not the question I'm asking. I just wanted to keep someone from jumping in and telling me exactly how to convert from binary to dec rather than answering my current question...Edit2: Okay, I'll be more specific. Basically, I'm trying to take a binary number(s), flip them around and get the positions of the ones and add them to an array. Then I'm going to try to iterate through the array, taking 2 to the power of each position and adding them up. Maybe not the most efficient way to convert from binary to decimal, but it's what I came up with. \nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
