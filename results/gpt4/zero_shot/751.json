First, we get the HttpServletResponse object from the ServletActionContext. Then, we get a PrintWriter object from the response. We use the write method of the PrintWriter to send the string \"Hello, World!\" as the response. After writing the response, we flush the writer to make sure all the data is sent, and then close the writer. The execute method returns null because the response is already sent using the writer."
