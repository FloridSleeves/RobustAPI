It maintains an array of indices, where each index corresponds to the current element of each array in the list. The code then iterates through the list, appending the current element of each array to the combination string. After printing the combination, it increments the last index. If the last index exceeds the length of the corresponding array, it resets the index to 0 and increments the previous index. This process continues until all indices have been reset to 0, indicating that all combinations have been generated. The `Iterator.next` API is not used in this solution because it is not necessary for this problem."

I am trying to iterate through the whole setup to generate all possible combinations:141      144      146      151      154      156      341      ...I am currently using recursion to achieve this:public static void recursive(List<int[]> list) {    recursive(list, 0, \"\");}private static void recursive(List<int[]> list, int counter, String string)  {    if (counter == list.size())        System.out.println(string);    else        for (int i: list.get(counter))            recursive(list, counter + 1, string + i);}I have 2 questions about this:I remember hearing the recursion can always be replaced by loops in some lecture, but I can't do it for this case. How would a loop version of this look?Is there a better way to solve this problem?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
