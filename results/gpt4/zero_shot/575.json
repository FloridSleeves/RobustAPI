We are always getting viewable .jpf files, but they usually do not have the specified number of layers or decomposition levels for zooming.Here is our code: //Get the tiff reader Iterator<ImageReader> readerIterator = ImageIO.getImageReadersByFormatName(\"tiff\"); ImageReader tiffreader = readerIterator.next(); //make an ImageInputStream from our tiff file and have the tiff reader read it ImageInputStream iis = ImageIO.createImageInputStream(itemFile); tiffreader.setInput(iis); //just pass empty params to the tiff reader ImageReadParam tparam; tparam = new TIFFImageReadParam(); IIOImage img = tiffreader.readAll(0, tparam); //set up target file File f = new File(itemTargetDirectory.getAbsolutePath() + \"/\" + destFileName); //we have tried FILTER_97 as well as different ProgressionTypes and compression settings J2KImageWriteParam param; param = new J2KImageWriteParam(); param.setProgressionType(\"layer\"); param.setFilter(J2KImageWriteParam.FILTER_53); //Our problem is that this param is not always respected in the resulting .jpf param.setNumDecompositionLevels(5); //get the JPEG 2000 writer                              Iterator<ImageWriter> writerIterator = ImageIO.getImageWritersByFormatName(\"JPEG 2000\"); J2KImageWriter jp2kwriter = null; jp2kwriter = (J2KImageWriter) writerIterator.next(); //write the jpf file ImageOutputStream ios = ImageIO.createImageOutputStream(f); jp2kwriter.setOutput(ios); jp2kwriter.write(null, img, param);It has been an odd experience, as the same code has behaved differently on subsequent runs.Any insights will be appreciated!\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
