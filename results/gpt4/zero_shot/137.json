This method creates the directory named by this abstract pathname, including any necessary but nonexistent parent directories. The method returns `true` if and only if the directory was created, along with all necessary parent directories; `false` otherwise. In the provided code, we first create a `File` object with the desired directory path. Then, we call `mkdirs()` on this object to create the directory. If the directory is created successfully, a success message is printed; otherwise, a failure message is printed."
