After performing the click operation that opens a new window, we iterate over all window handles. If the handle does not match the `mainWindow` handle, we switch to that window using `driver.switchTo().window(winHandle)`. After performing the necessary actions on the new window, we switch back to the main window using `driver.switchTo().window(mainWindow)`. The `Iterator.next` API is implicitly used in the for-each loop when iterating over the window handles."
