For each line, the processLine method is called, which increments the charCount by the length of the line, the wordCount by the number of tokens in the line, and the lineCount by 1. The getChar, getWords, and getLines methods return the respective counts. In the Main class, a Document object is created with the name of the text file, and the counts are printed out. The InputStream.read API is not used in this solution because BufferedReader.readLine is more suitable for reading lines of text."

The reason is because I do not have '\\n' at the end of the last sentence but my method adds  numChars += line.length() + 1;However, I cannot find a solution to why I get 0 for words and lines.*My texts includes elements as: ? , - 'After all, could anyone help me to make this work? **So far, I the problem that concerns me is how I can get a number of characters, if the last sentence does not have '\\n' element. Is there a chance I could fix that with an if statement? -Thank you!\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
