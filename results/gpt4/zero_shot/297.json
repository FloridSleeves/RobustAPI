This iterator will run through all elements cyclically. The next() method of Iterator interface is used to get the next element in the iteration. When the end of the list is reached, the index is reset to 0 to start the iteration from the beginning.\n\nA separate method singlePassIterator() is provided to get an iterator that will run through all elements just once. This iterator also uses the next() method of Iterator interface to get the next element in the iteration. When the end of the list is reached, the hasNext() method will return false and the next() method will throw NoSuchElementException.\n\nHowever, only the iterator returned by the iterator() method can be used with for-each loop by default. If you want to use the single pass iterator with for-each loop, you need to create a separate class that implements Iterable interface and returns the single pass iterator from its iterator() method."

Is this correct? Or is there a way I could use for-each with both?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
