The read method is used to read some number of bytes from the input stream and store them into the buffer array. The number of bytes actually read is returned as an integer. If no byte is available because the end of the stream has been reached, the value -1 is returned. This method blocks until input data is available, the end of the stream is detected, or an exception is thrown. If the length of buffer is zero, then no bytes are read and 0 is returned; otherwise, there is an attempt to read at least one byte. If no byte is available because the stream is at the end of the file, the value -1 is returned; otherwise, at least one byte is read and stored into buffer."

And this is inside a loop. The string printed in console sometimes not corrispond to the last write command but belong to the previus one.     while (running) {          char campioni = (char) start;          hexStart = Integer.toHexString(campioni).toUpperCase();          String stringa = \">eL#\" + hexStart + \"??!\\r\\n\" + \"\\n\";          output.write((\">eL\" + \"L#\" + hexStart + \"??!\\r\\n\").getBytes());          output.flush();           byte[] buffer = new byte[10000];           n=0;       try {          n = input.read(buffer);        } catch (IOException e1) {        e1.printStackTrace();        }             if(n>0){                    String data = new String (buffer,0,n);                    System.out.println(new String(buffer));                    start=start+5;                    Thread.sleep(2000);                }          }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
