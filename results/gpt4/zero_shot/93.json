The `writeBytes` method allows us to write a string as a sequence of bytes to the output stream. We first write the data, then a carriage return and newline to signify the end of the data, and finally the trailer. The `flush` method is called to ensure that all data is actually written out to the output stream. Note that this code does not handle chunking the data itself, it simply writes the data and trailer to the output stream. The actual chunking is handled by the servlet container or web server."

The httpclient considers the whole of inputstream (including the trailer) as a singlechunk.   I've also tried writing the trailer in a response header after the data has been written to the outputstream but without success.Please helpI haven't found any good sources on this. \nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:"
