The `session.run()` method executes the Cypher query and returns a `StatementResult` object. The `result.hasNext()` method is used to check if there are more records in the result. If there are, the `result.next()` method is used to get the next record. The `record.get()` method is used to get the properties of the node, which are returned as a map. The `asMap()` method is used to convert the result to a Java map, which is then printed to the console."

I need to get it for a Java application.Example:node FR contains: \"Salut_01\" : \"Bonjour\"node UK contains: \"Salut_01\" : \"Hello\"etc...\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
