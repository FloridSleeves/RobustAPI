It is an instance method, which means it must be called on an instance of the class, not the class itself. \n\nIn the first way, you are correctly calling `getBytes()` on the `word` instance of the `String` class. This method returns a sequence of bytes in the default charset that represents the `String` value.\n\nIn the second way, you are incorrectly trying to call `getBytes()` on the `String` class itself, which is not allowed because `getBytes()` is not a static method. \n\nIn Java, static methods belong to the class itself and can be called on the class, while instance methods belong to instances of the class and must be called on an instance."
