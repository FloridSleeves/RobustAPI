However, you can use the `Number` class which is the superclass of `Integer`, `Double`, `Long`, etc. This class provides a method `doubleValue()` which can be used to get the double value of any `Number` object. This way, you can sum up all numbers regardless of their specific type (`Integer`, `Double`, `Long`, etc.). The `Iterator.next` API is used implicitly in the enhanced for loop to iterate over the elements of the Iterable."

Because you can't have two methods with the same signature (Our compiler thinks Integer sum(Iterable<Integer>) has the same signature as Double sum(Iterable<Double>).) I tried to write one method with generics.private static <T extends Number> T sum(Iterable<? extends T> it) {    T result;    for(T next : it) {        result += next;    }    return result;}However this method will not compile (reason: the operator += is undefined for Object, Object). What can I do here? I know in C++ you can overload operators, but not in Java. But every class which extends Number does overload the += operator. What can I do here?Thank you in advance.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
