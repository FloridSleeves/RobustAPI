Writing to a file involves adding new data to it or modifying the existing data. If you read a file, modify the data (like adding double spaces, indents, etc.), and then write it back to the file, you are doing both reading and writing.\n\nThe PrintWriter command is used for writing formatted data to an output stream. It's like the System.out.println() command that you use to print data to the console, but instead, it prints data to a file or any other output stream.\n\nIn the given code, we first import the PrintWriter class. Then, we create a new PrintWriter object, specifying the name of the file we want to write to (\"output.txt\") and the character encoding (\"UTF-8\"). We then use the println() method of the PrintWriter object to write lines of text to the file. Finally, we close the PrintWriter object using the close() method.\n\nFileWriter is another class used for writing characters to a file. The difference between FileWriter and PrintWriter is that FileWriter is a character stream class to handle character data, whereas PrintWriter is a high-level stream that provides methods to write data in different formats, including text, primitive data types, and objects."

For reading a file I know you can use Scanner and read it and then print it. However reading a file and then printing it in a new format, like double space, indents, basically any spacing issues, is that also considered reading it or is it writing it? From my understanding of what my teacher has taught me, is that writing overwrites the original document and replaces it. Also how does one use the PrintWriter command? I have never seen this before in my class nor have read about it in my textbook but its on my test according to my teacher. Could someone give an explanation and an example about it? I read this site http://www.caveofprogramming.com/frontpage/articles/java/java-file-reading-and-writing-files-in-java/ on writing files, but it uses FileWriter, which I'm assuming takes the place of scanner? Is that right?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
