In your case, you are trying to write an integer to the output stream. The problem with your original code is that OutputStream.write(int) writes the lowest eight bits of the integer argument to the output stream. That's why you are seeing strange tokens in your output file. By using PrintWriter.write(String), you can write the string representation of the integer to the output stream, which should solve your problem."
