The Iterator.next() method returns the next element in the iteration and moves the cursor position. So, in your original code, for each number in your list, you were creating a new iterator which starts at the beginning of your shapes list, and thus always getting the first shape (Circle). By moving the iterator creation outside of the loop, the iterator maintains its state across all iterations of the loop, and you get each shape in turn as you'd expect."
