The PrintWriter instance is created outside the loop to ensure that the same file is being written to during each iteration. The \"\\n\" is added to the end of each line to ensure that each line from the original files starts on a new line in the output file. The PrintWriter is closed after the loop to ensure that all changes are saved to the file."
