The delimiter is set to \"<>,\" which means the string will be split at each occurrence of these characters. The 'false' argument means that the delimiter characters themselves will not be treated as tokens. Then, we use a while loop to iterate through all the tokens. Inside the loop, we use the matches method with the regular expression \"\\\\d+\" to check if the token is a number (since the data you want is numeric). If the token is a number, it is printed out."
