MappedByteBuffer is a memory-mapped file, which means it maps a region of file directly in memory. For large files, this can cause an OutOfMemoryError or IOException: Map Failed. Instead, you can use the FileChannel.write method, which writes a sequence of bytes to this channel from the given buffer. This method is more suitable for writing large files as it does not load the entire file into memory. In the provided code, ByteBuffer.wrap is used to create a new byte buffer that is backed by the byte array. Then, the FileChannel.write method is used to write the data to the file. After writing, it's always a good practice to close the channel and the file."
