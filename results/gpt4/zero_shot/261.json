We create a class `VirtualPlayerCount` that takes in the maximum number of players and an iterator of players. In the constructor, we iterate through the players using the `hasNext` and `next` methods of the iterator to count the number of online players. We also provide a method `setMaxPlayers` to set the maximum number of players and `getMaxPlayers` to get the maximum number of players. The `getOnlinePlayers` method returns the number of online players. This way, you can set a virtual number for the max player count and also get the number of online players. However, this will not work if you try to get the players via a query in a plugin as the plugin will likely use the actual server data."

I Thing to set a virtual number for the max Player Count I can use the Method setMaxPlayers(int mxPlayers) from the ServerListPing Event. But what about the online Players? And does it also work if I try to get the Players via a query in a plugin?Thank you for your help and sorry for my bad English ;)\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
