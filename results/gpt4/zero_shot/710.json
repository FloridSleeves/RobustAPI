In your case, you are writing the elements of a vector to a file. However, you forgot to close the PrintWriter object after writing to the file. This is necessary because it flushes the output stream, meaning it forces any buffered output bytes to be written out to the stream. If you don't close the PrintWriter, the data might not be written to the file, which could be why you're seeing null in the file. Also, you might want to add a new line after each write to ensure the data is written in a readable format."
