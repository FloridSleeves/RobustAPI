The first loop is more idiomatic and easier to read, which is generally more important than a negligible performance difference. The second loop might be slightly faster because it avoids the extra check for `it.hasNext()` on each iteration, but this difference is likely too small to be noticeable in most cases. The performance can also depend on the specific implementation of the Iterator and the JVM optimizations. In general, it's recommended to write clear and readable code, and only optimize when necessary and when there's a clear performance benefit."

I'm asking because the times given by Junit are not too exact, but they give an approximate value\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
