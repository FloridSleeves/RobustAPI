It is more efficient than the split method and can be faster when you just need to split a string by a single character, which is the case here. The StringTokenizer.nextToken method is used to return the next token from the StringTokenizer object. In the given code, we create a StringTokenizer object with the string to be split and the delimiter. Then, we use a while loop to iterate through the tokens, adding each one to an ArrayList. Finally, we convert the ArrayList to an array."

Also, the split method takes a regular expression, which is superfluous here.What alternative can I use in order to optimize the string splitting? Is StringUtils.split faster?(I would've tried and tested myself but profiling my application takes a lot of time.)\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
