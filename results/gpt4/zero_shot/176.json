It returns the total number of bytes read into the buffer, or -1 if there is no more data because the end of the stream has been reached. In your case, you are reading the data into a buffer of size 8*1024 bytes. However, you are not considering the actual number of bytes read. The read method returns the number of bytes actually read, which can be less than the size of the buffer. Therefore, you should use the bytesRead variable to create the ByteArrayInputStream. This ensures that you are only considering the actual data read from the input stream, and not the entire buffer. This way, you can be sure that you are reading the body data (if any) starting from the correct position in the inputstream."
