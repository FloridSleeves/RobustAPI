If it does, it retrieves the ArrayList associated with that key using the Map.get method and adds the new value to it. If the map does not contain the key, it creates a new ArrayList, adds the value to it, and puts the new key-value pair into the map. This way, the ArrayList associated with each key in the map is appended with new values instead of being overwritten."

I assume it's easily done I'm just missing something obvious.\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:"
