In your case, you are using it to split each line into individual numbers. To stop before the last line, you can simply subtract 1 from the total amount of lines in your for-loop condition. This way, the loop will stop before it reaches the last line. After the loop, you can still use in.readLine() to read the last line."

No problem therebut then i have this for-loopfor (int i = 0; i < (amount of lines); i++) {        StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());        graph.addEdge(Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken()), Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken()));    }i cant write in the code how many times i want it to put integers, because my code should run generally with other inputs...How can i make it stop before the last line, i still need to be able to use the last bufferreaderline\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
