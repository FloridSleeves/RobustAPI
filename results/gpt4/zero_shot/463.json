LinkedHashMap is used because it maintains the insertion order. Then we create an iterator for the entry set of the map. We use the Iterator.next method to iterate over each entry in the map. For each entry, we append the key (character) to the output string for the number of times it appears (value). Finally, we print the output string."

What would be the most efficient way of accomplishing this task?UPDATE.As you can see the desired order is not alphabetical, that includes reverse. As I mentioned the objective is to group the strings and order them by first appearance. For this example I am using letter to simplify a (lot) more complex problem I am trying to solve. The thing to concentrate with here is the order on which the letter of each string appear. Grouping in a specific order, rather than ordering.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
