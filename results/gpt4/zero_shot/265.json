The 'next' method returns the next element in the iteration. In the provided code, an Iterator is created for the collection 'c'. The 'min' variable is initialized with the first element of the collection. Then, the collection is iterated using a for-each loop. In each iteration, the current element is compared with 'min'. If the current element is smaller than 'min', 'min' is updated with the current element. After the loop, the smallest element in the collection is returned. This code avoids the use of unsafe or unchecked operations by using the Iterator API instead of creating a generic array."

From what I understand this results from not specifying the type of objects in my collection. I'm currently working with int's for testing purposes, but the program is supposed to allow for sorting of any type object. I don't think I want to specify my collections as int's, and my collection is currently of type T for this reason. But my instructions explicitly state that my program should not generate any warnings. Here is one of my methods:What I have now:     else {        T[] a = new T[c.size()];        c.toArray(T[] a);        T min = a[0];        for (int i = 0; i < a.size(); i++) {           if (comp.compare(min, a[i]) > 0) {              min = a[i];           }        }        return min;      }What I'm getting:    Testing.java:48: error: generic array creation            T[] a = c.toArray(new T[c.size()]);\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
