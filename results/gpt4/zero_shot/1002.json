However, the difference in the \"rawHmac\" and \"result\" values between the two codes could be due to the different ways Java and C# implement the HMACSHA256 algorithm. The HMACSHA256 algorithm uses a secret key for hashing, and even a slight difference in the implementation can lead to different results. It's also worth noting that the way the two languages handle string encoding could also contribute to the difference."
