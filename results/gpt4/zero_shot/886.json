The method returns a Cursor object, which can be used to navigate through the result set. \n\nIn your original code, you were directly comparing the Cursor object with null using the equals method, which is not the correct way to check if a Cursor is null. Instead, you should use the '==' operator. \n\nAlso, you were not closing the Cursor after use, which can lead to memory leaks. It's a good practice to close the Cursor in a finally block to ensure it gets closed even if an exception is thrown.\n\nIn the updated code, the query method is used with a selection argument to prevent SQL injection attacks. The '?' is a placeholder that gets replaced by the value in the selectionArgs array. \n\nThe method first checks if the Cursor is not null and then calls the moveToFirst method on it. If the Cursor is not empty, moveToFirst will return true, indicating that there is at least one row (i.e., the record exists). If the Cursor is empty, moveToFirst will return false. \n\nFinally, the Cursor is closed to free up resources."
