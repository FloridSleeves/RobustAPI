It reads the file in chunks of 1024 bytes at a time, which can then be written to your audio output stream. This method of reading the file can be faster than reading the entire file at once, especially for larger files. However, this code does not use threads. If you want to read the file while other parts of your game are running, you would need to run this code in a separate thread."

Currently the sound system I have is working (basically the same code as the top answer here), but there is a significant stall during every output (~200-300 ms). Since it's a quick game I'm looking for something significant quicker. I'm not experienced with Threads, but would those be applicable here?\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:"
