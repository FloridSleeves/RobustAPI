Then, you are using the JSONObject.getJSONArray method to get the JSONArray associated with the key. The JSONArray is then iterated over using a for loop, and each value is printed out using the JSONArray.getString method. The reason your original code was not working is because you were trying to print the JSONArray directly, instead of iterating over it and printing each value."

Here is the structure:{\"key1 \":[\"dog\",\"cat\"],\"key2\":[\"house\",\"boat\"]}So, I want to extract the values dog and cat, also values house and boat. I tried the following in Java:    //obj - has this JSON.    Iterator iter = obj.keys();    for (int i=0; i<len; i++){        String key = (String)iter.next();        System.out.println(\"Key is --> \"+key);  //This is correctly giving me the keys.        System.out.println(\"Value is --> \"+clientDetails.getJSONArray(key)); //This is not working. I tried lots of other things but to no avail.     }Could somebody please guide me here.thanks,Kay\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
