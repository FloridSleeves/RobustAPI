The StringTokenizer class allows us to break a string into tokens. We are using the constructor StringTokenizer(String str, String delim) where str is the string to be parsed and delim is the set of delimiters. In this case, we are using the quote (\") as the delimiter. The method nextToken() is used to return the next token from the string. We are using a while loop to iterate through all the tokens and add them to a list. We are also checking if there are more tokens available using the hasMoreTokens() method. If there are more tokens, we skip the next token because it is outside the quotes. Finally, we return the list of words that are between quotes."
