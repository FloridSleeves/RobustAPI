It provides a single sorting sequence only, i.e., you can sort the elements on the basis of a single data member only. In your case, `Bag<T extends Comparable<T>>` means that the type T must implement the Comparable interface.\n\nTo remove the minimum item from the array, you first find the minimum item and its index. Then, you shift all elements to the left starting from the index of the minimum item. Finally, you decrease the size of the array by 1. The `Iterator.next` method is used to iterate over the elements of the array."

What's the purpose?My second question is how to remove an item from this Comparable array. I have wrote the removeMin method, I have found the item, I named the variable \"min\", how do I go on and remove this min item from the arrayList? Thanks a lot!Here's some partial code:public class Bag<T extends Comparable<T>> implements Iterable<T> {    private int MAX_ITEMS = 10; // initial array size    private int size;    private Comparable[] data;    public Bag( ) {        //data = (Comparable []) new Object[MAX_ITEMS];        data = (T []) new Comparable[MAX_ITEMS];        size = 0;    }      public Comparable removeMin(){          Iterator<T> iterator=iterator();          T min = iterator.next();          while (iterator.hasNext())          {               T next = iterator.next();             if (min.compareTo(next) > 0)                 min = next;                ****************************************************                How to remove this min item?                 ****************************************************                }          return min;          }\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
