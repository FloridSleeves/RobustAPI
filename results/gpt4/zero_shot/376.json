It then creates an Iterator for each list. The Iterators are used to traverse the lists and compare the elements one by one. If a pair of elements are not equal, the variable `isDifferent` is set to true and the loop is broken. After the loop, if one of the Iterators still has elements (meaning the lists have different sizes), `isDifferent` is also set to true. Finally, the result is printed to the console. If the elements in your ArrayList are instances of a custom class, you should indeed override the equals() method in that class to define what it means for two instances to be equal."

I don't care what's the difference, I just want to know if they're not the same.I'm fetching scores list from a database every minute, and only if the scores list that I fetched is different from the one I fetched a minute ago I want to send it to the client.Now the value of the ArrayList is actually a class that I created (that contains name, lvl, rank, score).Do I need to implement equals() on it?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
