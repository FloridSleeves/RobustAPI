The Iterator.next method returns the next element in the iteration. The for loop runs k times or until there are no more elements in the map, whichever comes first. In each iteration, it calls the next method to get the next element and then calls the remove method to remove it from the map. This way, it removes k elements from the map without explicitly iterating over all elements."

I want it cut down to size... I don't care which elements I remove, I just want k of the elements removed.What's the most efficient way to do this (other than iterating)?Edit: k is not known in advance. Suggestions to based on other kinds of maps are relevant.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
