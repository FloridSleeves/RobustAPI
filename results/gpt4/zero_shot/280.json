This method retrieves the next element in the iteration and advances the iterator. This way, the stream is not consumed twice, avoiding the IllegalStateException. The filter operation is moved to the concat operation to ensure that the head is not filtered out."

Is there a method in Java 8 Stream that I can use to achieve this?Thanks.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
