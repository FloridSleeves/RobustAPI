Then, we use the `Collections.enumeration()` method to get an Enumeration over the set of keys in the map. This method takes a Collection (in this case, the keySet of the map) and returns an Enumeration that generates all the items in the collection. We then use a while loop to iterate over the Enumeration and print out each key. The `hasMoreElements()` method of Enumeration is used to check if there are more elements in the enumeration, and the `nextElement()` method is used to get the next element in the enumeration."

I can only get a keySet(). From that Set, I can get an Iterator but an Iterator seems to be something different than an Enumeration. What is the best and most performant way to directly get an Enumeration from the Keys of a HashMap?Background: I am implementing my own ResourceBundle (=>getKeys() Method), and I have to provide/implement a method that returns the Enumeration of all Keys. But my implementation is based on a HashMap so I need to somehow figure out how to best convert betweens these two \"Iterator/Enumerator\" techniques.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
