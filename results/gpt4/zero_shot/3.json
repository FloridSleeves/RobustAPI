We then use the Activity's findViewById method to get a reference to the TextView we want to change. We store this TextView in a member variable. We then provide a method changeText that takes a String as a parameter. This method uses the Activity's runOnUiThread method to ensure that the UI update (changing the text of the TextView) is done on the UI thread. This is necessary because only the original thread that created a view hierarchy can touch its views."

Here's the code:LayoutInflater mInflater = (LayoutInflater) mContext.getSystemService(mContext.LAYOUT_INFLATER_SERVICE);View view = mInflater.inflate(R.layout.target_details, null);TextView val = (TextView) view.findViewById(R.id.val);Not sure if I'm doing it properly.UPDATE:I used Kay's answer with added code below. It's now working.((Activity)mContext).runOnUiThread(new Runnable(){        @Override        public void run(){            //settext here        }    });\nPlease using this api: Activity.findViewById.\nAnswer:"
