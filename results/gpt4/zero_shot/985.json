The `getBytes()` method is used to convert the PDF content into a byte array, which is then encoded to Base64. The encoded byte array is then converted to a string using the `String` constructor.\n\nOn the Node.js side, you are using the built-in `Buffer` object to decode the Base64 string back into binary. The `from` method is used to create a new Buffer from the Base64 string, specifying 'base64' as the encoding. This will give you the original binary data.\n\nThe differences you are seeing could be due to differences in the Base64 encoding/decoding implementations between Java and Node.js, or due to differences in how the PDF content is being read into memory. It's also possible that the PDF content is being modified in some way before it is encoded/decoded. \n\nTo ensure compatibility, you should make sure that you are using the same Base64 encoding/decoding implementation on both sides, or at least implementations that are known to be compatible. You should also make sure that the PDF content is being read into memory in the same way on both sides."

Further confusing the matter I introduced an intermediate step saving the base64Encoded string out to disk prior to decoding it.  I also then opened the original file (from the Pentaho Side) and encoded that using the Buffer(fs.readFileSync(originalPath)).toString('base64') and compared the base 64 encoded versions of each.  I was hoping to confirm that the algorithm is different (although there is no guarantee). The files themselves were the same length, and started and finished with no differences.  Scattered about the file were bunch of minor differences.  1 byte here 1 byte there.Other bits: Apache.Commons...Base64 uses \"rfc 2045\" Buffer on the Node Js side uses \"rfc 4648\" (I may be misreading the description).  Questions, Is there a known way to communicate base64 between a Java encoding and Node Js decoding?Are there other recommendation on base64 encoding in Pentaho?\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:"
