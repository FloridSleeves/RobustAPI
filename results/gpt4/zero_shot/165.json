We then compare these bytes. If they are not equal, we print \"Bytes are not equal\" and break the loop. If they are equal, we continue to the next byte. The loop will continue until we have read all bytes from both files or until we find a pair of bytes that are not equal. The InputStream.read method returns -1 when it reaches the end of the file, so we use this to determine when to stop reading. Finally, we close the InputStreams to free up system resources."

Improve this question                    can anyone write pseudocode to compare byte to byte in Java. I understand that we use read() to read byte to byte. but how do we do the comparison? \nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
