When we want to invoke the method with a specific array, we simply retrieve the array from the map using the array's name (which is the key in the map). The `Map.get` method is used to retrieve the array from the map. If the key is not found in the map, `Map.get` returns null, so we should check for this case to avoid a NullPointerException."

Perhaps storing the variables in an array? What I'd like to do, in case I'm faced with thousands of 2D arrays, is invoking the method with the value of a variable of a different data type, like this:String arrayToBeInvokedWith = \"array1\";method(arrayToBeInvokedWith){}(Yes, I do know this is too simplistic, but you can get the idea from it)Is there a similar solution? Any feedback is much appreciated.EDIT: All of the arrays have a same size.\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:"
