This was causing the instance variables to remain null when you tried to use them in the printExp method. By removing the reinitialization, the instance variables are correctly initialized when the constructor is called, and can be used in the printExp method. \n\nAlso, I have replaced the `println` method with the `write` method from the PrintWriter API as per your request. The `write` method does not automatically append a newline character at the end of the string, so I have added it manually with `\\n`. \n\nFinally, when writing the Expense object to the file, I have called the `toString` method on the object to convert it to a string before writing. If the Expense class does not override the `toString` method, you may need to do so to ensure the object is written to the file in the desired format."
