In this case, it is used to read the image data from the input stream into a byte array. This byte array is then checked to see if it contains an invalid token error message. If it does, the error is handled and the request is repeated. This solution is safe to use for thumbnails of max 80kb size. However, it is important to note that this method blocks until input data is available, the end of the stream is detected, or an exception is thrown. Therefore, it should be used with caution in situations where the input stream might not have any data available for a long period of time."

To have access to images the client should provide a valid token and sometimes server can return \"expired crsf token\" error. In order to handle this behavior a custom ImageDownloader should be defined. Below is the base implementation of method that should be overrrided in my implementation.protected InputStream getStreamFromNetwork(String imageUri, Object extra) throws IOException {    HttpURLConnection conn = createConnection(imageUri, extra);    int redirectCount = 0;    while (conn.getResponseCode() / 100 == 3 && redirectCount < MAX_REDIRECT_COUNT) {         conn = createConnection(conn.getHeaderField(\"Location\"), extra);         redirectCount++;    }    InputStream imageStream;    try {         imageStream = conn.getInputStream();    } catch (IOException e) {         // Read all data to allow reuse connection (http://bit.ly/1ad35PY)         IoUtils.readAndCloseStream(conn.getErrorStream());         throw e;    }    if (!shouldBeProcessed(conn)) {         IoUtils.closeSilently(imageStream);         throw new IOException(\"Image request failed with response code \" + conn.getResponseCode());    }    return new ContentLengthInputStream(new BufferedInputStream(imageStream, BUFFER_SIZE), conn.getContentLength());}I want to rewrite it to handle invalid token errors. For example, if the server returns such error it should be recognized, token should be regenerated and request repeated. The only solution I come up with is like this (shortened code):imageStream = conn.getInputStream();byte[] body = org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils.toByteArray(imageStream);if (body.length < 300  // high probability to contain err message             && isInvalidToken(body)) {              // handle error}return new ByteArrayInputStream(body);Is is safe to use such kind of solution, considering I use it only for thumbnails of max 80kb size? Are there any other solutions?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
