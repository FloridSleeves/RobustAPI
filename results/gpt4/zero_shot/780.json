However, it is used in Java to write formatted data to output stream. In the context of servlets, you might use PrintWriter.write to send a response back to the client.\n\nThe <servlet-mapping> in web.xml is used to map a servlet to a URL pattern. When the web server receives a request for a URL that matches the pattern, it knows to forward the request to the corresponding servlet. This is a key part of how Java web applications handle requests and responses."
