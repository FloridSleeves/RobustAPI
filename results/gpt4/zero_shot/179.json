We first create a byte array of size 4 to hold the bytes we read from the file. We then read 4 bytes from the file into the buffer. The read method returns the number of bytes actually read, which we store in bytesRead. If bytesRead is not 4, it means we have reached the end of the file before reading all 4 bytes, so we throw an IOException.\n\nWe then extract the version and record length from the buffer. The version is the first byte of the buffer, which we convert to an int using bitwise AND with 0xFF to remove the sign bit. The record length is the next 3 bytes of the buffer, which we convert to an int by shifting the bytes to the correct positions and using bitwise OR to combine them. The bitwise AND with 0xFF is used to remove the sign bit from each byte before shifting."

Im familiar with basic TCP sockets but want to know how to translate requirements into code.Example: Format for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Common Log Format (CLF)Would like to see how to translate: 0          7 8        15 16       23 24         31  +-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+  |  Version  |           Record Length           | 0 - 3  +-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+   Version (1 byte):  0x41 for this document; hexadecimal encoded.
