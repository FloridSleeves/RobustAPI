The `DateTimeSerializer` class implements GSON's `JsonSerializer` interface and overrides its `serialize` method. In the `serialize` method, it converts the DateTime object to a string using its `toString` method and then wraps it in a `JsonPrimitive` object. This `JsonPrimitive` object is then returned. \n\nThe `Gson` object is then built using a `GsonBuilder` and the custom serializer is registered to it using the `registerTypeAdapter` method. This tells GSON to use the `DateTimeSerializer` whenever it encounters a `DateTime` object during serialization. \n\nHowever, there is no standard pre-rolled library for Joda-Time serializers in GSON. You would have to create your own serializers like the one above. The `JsonElement.getAsString` method is not directly used in this context, but it is used internally by GSON when converting the `JsonPrimitive` to a JSON string."

These objects graphs use Joda Time entities (DateTime, LocalTime etc).The top Google hit for \"gson joda\" is this page:https://sites.google.com/site/gson/gson-type-adapters-for-common-classesIt provides source for a type adapter for org.joda.time.DateTime.  This link is also what is referenced in the GSON User Guide.I expected to find a pre-rolled library that included joda-time serialisers that I could reference as a Maven dependency - but I can't find one.  Is there one?  Or am I forced to replicate that snippet in my own project?\nPlease using this api: JsonElement.getAsString.\nAnswer:"
