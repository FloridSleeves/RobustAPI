In your case, you are creating a new iterator for each iteration of the while loop. This is necessary because you are modifying the set within the loop (by removing elements), which invalidates any existing iterators. The ConcurrentModificationException you encountered when using a foreach loop is due to this modification of the set while iterating over it. By creating a new iterator for each iteration of the while loop, you avoid this issue."

For example, a set of football players and we partition them depending on the team they belong to. I want in the end a list of representatives, i.e. one player from each team.All football players know all other player on their team -- this is very relevant for the complexity. So, my current idea on how to do this is as follows (where set is currently a LinkedHashSet<T>): while (!set.isEmpty()) {    E e = set.iterator().next();    makeRepresentative(e);    set.remove(AllPlayersOnSameTeamAs(e));}However, it feels weird to build a new iterator in every step of the while-loop. A LinkedHashSet is supposed to have some kind of firstElement() function internally (for its LinkedList behaviour), but for some reason I can't find how to do this. I also tried a foreach loop instead, but that resulted in a java.util.ConcurrentModificationException. How am I supposed to do this correctly?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
