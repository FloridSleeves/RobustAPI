The `Map.get` method is used to retrieve an instance of A by its name. This method returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or null if this map contains no mapping for the key. This approach allows us to directly access the instance of A by its name, without the need to iterate over all instances."

B contains the instances of A. I want to return instance of A from B by its name:class A{    public String name;    public A (String name)    {        this.name = name;    }}class B{    public A a1;    public A a2;    public A a3;    public B ()    {        this.a1 = new A (\"a1\");        this.a2 = new A (\"a2\");        this.a3 = new A (\"a3\");    }    public A get_A_byName (String name)    {        // Is it possible to write something like this? B will always contain only instances of A        for (A a : B.variables)        {            if (a.name.equals(name))            {                return a;            }            // Or in case A doesn't have a variable \"name\", can I get an A instance by its declared name in B?            if (a.getClass().getName().equals(name))            {                return a;            }        }    }}Is it possible to do things described in code's comments?
