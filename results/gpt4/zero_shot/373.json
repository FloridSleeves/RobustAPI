The 'next()' method of the Iterator is used to get the next entry in the hashtable. For each entry, we get the key and value, and append them to a StringBuilder in the desired format. We also check if there is another entry in the hashtable using 'hasNext()' method of the Iterator, and if so, we append 'to' to the StringBuilder. Finally, we return the string representation of the StringBuilder."
