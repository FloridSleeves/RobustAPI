HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) is a specific type of message authentication code (MAC) involving a cryptographic hash function and a secret cryptographic key. In your Java code, you were using SHA-256 directly, which is not the same as HMAC-SHA256. The correct way to do this in Java is to use the \"HmacSHA256\" algorithm with a SecretKeySpec, as shown in the revised code. The getBytes method is used to convert the secret and pathAndQuery strings into bytes, which are then used to compute the HMAC. The result is then encoded in Base64 format."

Unfortunately I am not able to get any of them. I have mentioned PHP example below.  public function GenerateSignature($Secret,$PathAndQuery)     {       return base64_encode(\\Zend_Crypt_Hmac::compute($Secret, 'sha256',       $PathAndQuery, \\Zend_Crypt_Hmac::BINARY));     }Can anyone please explain me how can I achieve the same with Java code? I have tried below code but it seems it's not generating proper outcome. public static String generateSignature(String secrete, String pathAndQuery){        String encoded = null;        try {            MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\");            md.update(secrete.getBytes(\"UTF-8\"));            md.update(pathAndQuery.getBytes(\"UTF-8\"));            byte[] digest = md.digest();            encoded = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(digest);        } catch (Exception e) {            e.printStackTrace();        }        return encoded;    }NOTE : I have used Java-8 for while writing above code. \nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:"
