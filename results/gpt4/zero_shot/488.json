This interface provides methods to iterate over the results of a database query. In the given code, we are creating a `Criteria` object and setting the fetch size to 50. Then, we are using the `scroll` method of the `Criteria` object to get a `ScrollableResults` object. We are using the `next` method of the `ScrollableResults` object to iterate over the results. The `next` method returns `true` if there are more results and `false` otherwise. Inside the loop, we are getting the current result using the `get` method of the `ScrollableResults` object and processing it. After processing each entity, we are evicting it from the session to free up memory. Finally, we are closing the session."

However, when I do lazy loading in Java/Hibernate. What is the recommended way to iterate over the collection using lazy loading and something similar to yield return ?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
