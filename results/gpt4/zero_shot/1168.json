The StringTokenizer class is used to split a string into tokens. The countTokens() method is used to get the total number of tokens. The hasMoreTokens() method is used to check if there are more tokens available. If there are, the nextToken() method is used to get the next token. The tokens are then stored in the words array. The method finally returns the words array."

This is what I have came up with so far:// split takes some string as the argument, and returns the array// whose elements are the words in the stringpublic static String[] split (String s){    // determine the number of words    java.util.Scanner t = new java.util.Scanner (s);    int countWords = 0;    String w;    while (t.hasNext ())    {        w = t.next ();        countWords++;    }    // create appropriate array and store the string\u2019s words in it    // code here}As you can see, I can just input each word via Scanner. Now I just have to put all the words of the String into an array as the elements. However, I'm not sure how to proceed.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
