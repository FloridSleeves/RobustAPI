The PrintWriter is initialized with an OutputStreamWriter that is set to use \"UTF-8\" encoding. The '\\ufeff' character is the Unicode representation of the UTF-8 BOM. The rest of the code is the same as the original, it fetches records from the ResultSet object and writes them to the CSV file."

Oracle database also has a NLS_CHARACTERSET value of UTF8.Please suggest.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
