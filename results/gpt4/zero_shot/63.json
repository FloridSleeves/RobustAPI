It can read fewer bytes. Therefore, you should check the return value of `input.read(aesKey)`, which tells you how many bytes were actually read. If it's not equal to `aesKey.length`, then not all bytes of the AES key were read, which might be the cause of your problem."

In this method, the AES key is supposed to be deciphered by using an RSA CipherInputStream.public void loadKey(File in, byte[] privateKey) throws GeneralSecurityException, IOException {    PKCS8EncodedKeySpec privateKeySpec = new PKCS8EncodedKeySpec(privateKey);    KeyFactory kf = KeyFactory.getInstance(\"RSA\");    PrivateKey pk = kf.generatePrivate(privateKeySpec);    rsacipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, pk);    aesKey = new byte[128/8];    FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(in);    CipherInputStream input = new CipherInputStream(fis, rsacipher);    input.read(aesKey);    aesKeySpec = new SecretKeySpec(aesKey, \"AES\");    input.close();    fis.close(); } the FileInputStream gives me the encoded key (it is not the problem) but when passed through the CipherInputStream, the data becomes all zeroes. aesKey and aesKeySpec are static variables, privateKey is a valid RSA key.Any help in finding the problem would be much appreciated!\nPlease using this api: Cipher.init.\nAnswer:"
