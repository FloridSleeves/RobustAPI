The nextToken() method is used to get the next token (substring) from the StringTokenizer. The first call to nextToken() will give the first part of the string (\"Fruit\") and the second call will give the second part of the string (\" they taste good\"). We then use the setText() method to set the text of two TextViews to these two parts. The trim() method is used to remove the leading and trailing spaces from the second string."

I would like to split up the CurrentString using the : as the delimiter.So that way the word \"Fruit\" will be split into its own string and \"they taste good\" will be another string.And then i would simply like to use SetText() of 2 different TextViews to display that string. What would be the best way to approach this? \nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
