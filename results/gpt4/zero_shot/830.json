First, we create a PrintWriter object for the file.txt. Then, we use the print(\"\") method to empty the file. After that, we close the PrintWriter. To append text to the file, we create a new PrintWriter object with a FileWriter object as a parameter. The FileWriter object is created with two parameters: the file name and a boolean indicating whether to append the data written. Then, we use the write method of the PrintWriter to append the text to the file. Finally, we close the PrintWriter."
