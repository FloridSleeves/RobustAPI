We then create a new Exception object and print its stack trace to the PrintWriter. This will write the stack trace to the file. The 'true' parameter in the FileOutputStream constructor means that the file will be appended to, rather than overwritten. Finally, we close the PrintWriter. If the file is not found, a FileNotFoundException will be thrown and its stack trace will be printed to the standard error stream."
