Sets are designed to prevent duplicate elements, and they do not maintain any specific order of their elements. Therefore, the concept of an index does not apply to a Set.\n\nIf you need to retrieve a specific item from a Set, you can use an Iterator, as shown in the code above. The Iterator.next() method returns the next element in the iteration. However, because a Set is not ordered, the \"next\" element can be any element in the Set.\n\nIf you need to maintain a specific order of elements, consider using a List or a SortedSet instead. A List maintains the order of its elements based on the sequence in which they were added, and it has a get(int index) method. A SortedSet maintains its elements in a sorted order."

(other than using an iterator)I'm sure the fact that it's excluded from the API means there's a good reason for not doing this -- could someone please enlighten me?EDIT:Some extremely great answers here, and a few saying \"more context\".  The specific scenario was a dbUnit test, where I could reasonably assert that the returned set from a query had only 1 item, and I was trying to access that item.However, the question is more valid without the scenario, as it remains more focussed:What's the difference between set and list.Thanks to all for the fantastic answers below.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
