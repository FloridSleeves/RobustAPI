However, you can use PrintWriter for sending commands and DataOutputStream for sending data. The PrintWriter is used to send text commands like \"INFO\" or \"DATA\". After sending a command, you should call flush() to ensure that the command is actually sent. Then, you can use DataOutputStream to send the actual data. Again, you should call flush() after writing data to ensure that it is actually sent."

Is this possible and what is the best way to do it?I've tried just creating both types of objects, for example ObjectOutputStream and DataOutputStream, but that doesn't seem to work.The reason I want to switch between them is to, for example, send a text command \"INFO\" that signals I'm about to send an object with information or a command \"DATA\" signalling that I'm about to send data.  Any advice on the best way to do this is appreciated.\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:"
