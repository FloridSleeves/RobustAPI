It returns the next element in the iteration. However, if you don't want to access the element, you can simply ignore the returned value. This way, you can traverse through the collection without accessing the elements. This is the closest you can get to C++ style iterators with the standard Java library. There is no de facto standard interface that has evolved to separate traversal from element access in Java."

I want something more like C++ iterators, where I can move the pointer around without returning an element.  Is there something in the standard library like this, or has some de facto standard interface evolved through custom?  (If not, please don't waste your time posting code snippets - I'm quite able to think up reasonable names which will do the job).  \nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
