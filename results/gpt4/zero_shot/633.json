Then, we iterate over the vector that contains the data. For each object in the vector, we create a new row (which is a HashMap in your case) and add the object to it. Then, we add this row to the model of the JTable using the `addRow()` method. This way, we can dynamically add rows to the JTable. The `Map.get` API is not used in this context as we are not retrieving any value from a map using a key."

No, it did not help me. Yes, I am a dolt. Please don't answer with a reference to that document. What I am specifically interested in is how to dynamically add rows and columns to my Jtable via the Netbeans IDE. I already have an object that contains a hashmap with my data. I can't figure out where or what object I should be passing that object to. Thanks for your time! I have a vector that contains a series (of length l) of objects (each one corresponding to a row). How do I get that vector object to display on the JTable?\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:"
