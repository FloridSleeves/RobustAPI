In your code, you are using it to iterate over a LinkedList of Student objects. When the deleteStudent method is called, it iterates over the list until it finds a Student object with the matching studentID. Once it finds the matching Student object, it removes it from the list using the Iterator.remove() method. The ConcurrentModificationException you are seeing is typically thrown when the list is being modified while it is being iterated over. This can be avoided by using the Iterator's own remove method, as you are doing in your code. However, you need to make sure that the Iterator is properly initialized and that the list is not being modified elsewhere in your code while the iteration is taking place."
