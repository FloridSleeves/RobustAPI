However, you can use an Iterator to iterate over the list of CFGs. The `next()` method of the Iterator API allows you to access the next element in the list without breaking the loop. This way, you can analyze each CFG and process the returned value within the loop. Note that the `hasNext()` method is used to check if there is a next element in the list, preventing a `NoSuchElementException`."

I am implementing a static analysis tool where I have to analyze a list of methods (CFGs) in a for loop. The size of CFG list is not known in advance.  Each method in the for loop has to return some value. As asked above, is there a way to do it in a loop without breaking the loop? One possible alternative comes in mind is that I can unroll the loop, assuming the maximum list size could be some fixed value. But this does not solve the problem completely. Any help would be appreciated.code looks like below.for(CFG cfg: cfgList){   val = analyze(cfg);   return val;   //I want for loop not to stop here.}P.S. I cannot store the values in a list to return values later.Edit1:For example, consider following statements.call method1();st2;st3;...This method1() can be any of five different methods. For all five possible options, I want to analyze each of them, return their values and analyze rest of the statements accordingly. So, I would analyze these 5 methods as below.call method1-option1();st2;st3;...call method1-option2();st2;st3;...call method1-option3();st2;st3;...Hope, it helps in understanding the question.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
