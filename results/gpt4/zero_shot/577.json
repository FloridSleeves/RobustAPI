It then creates a StringBuilder to build the comma-separated string. It first checks if the iterator has a next element, and if it does, it appends it to the StringBuilder. Then, while there are still more elements, it appends a comma and a space, followed by the next element. Finally, it converts the StringBuilder to a String to get the final result."
