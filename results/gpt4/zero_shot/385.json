It starts by checking if the size of the array is less than 3, if so it returns false. Then it creates an Iterator for the ArrayList. It gets the first two elements of the ArrayList using the next() method of the Iterator. Then it enters a loop that continues as long as there are more elements in the ArrayList. In each iteration of the loop, it gets the next element of the ArrayList and checks if it is the sum of the previous two elements. If it is not, it returns false. If it is, it updates the two previous elements to be the second and third elements of the current three-element sequence, and continues to the next iteration. If it finishes the loop without finding any three-element sequence that does not follow the Fibonacci rule, it returns true."

I know it's very flawed but i really have no clue how to move on.public class ArrayCheck { /** * Tests if the given array is a part of the Fibonacci sequence. * * @param arr array to be tested * @return true if the elements are part of the fibonacci sequence */public boolean isFibonacci(ArrayList<Integer> arr) {    //check if array exists    if(arr.size() == 0)        return false;    //check if array is bigger than 3    if (arr.size() < 3)        return false;    //check for the startsequence of 0,1,1    else if(arr.get(0) == 0 && arr.get(1) == 1 && arr.get(2) == 1)        return true;    //check every number in array    for(int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {        //check if i >= 2 is fib        if(i >= 2) {            int fibn = i;            int nextfib = i + 1;            int fibnew = (fibn - 1) + (fibn - 2);            int fibnext = (nextfib - 1) + (nextfib - 2);            if (arr.get(i) != fibnew && arr.get(i + 1) != fibnext)                return false;        }        //check if the order is right        if(arr.get(i) > arr.get(i+1))            return false;    }    return true;}Any help is greatly appreciated!\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
