It does not automatically flush the output stream. Therefore, if you do not close the PrintWriter, some data may not be written to the file. In your case, the PrintWriter is not closed, so some data may not be written to the file. To ensure that all data is written to the file, you should close the PrintWriter in a finally block. This ensures that the PrintWriter is closed whether an exception is thrown or not."
