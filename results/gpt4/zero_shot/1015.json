In the given code, we create an instance of StringTokenizer with the string 'time'. The nextToken() method of StringTokenizer returns the next token from the string. Since we haven't specified a delimiter, it uses the default delimiter which is space (\" \"). So, the first token will be the part of the string before the space, effectively removing \" sec\" from the string."

I want to do it in just one line. I know the other ways, convert to char array search for space and delete and all after that but I was wondering if this could be done like \"1.2 sec\" - \" sec\" or like time - \" sec\" or something like that but just in a line or two. If there isn't then I know how to do it. But if there is how?Update:If I execute this code:String time = stopwatch1.getjLabel4text();String replace = time.replace(\" sec\",\"\");System.out.println(replace+\"\");System.out.println(time+\"\");I get output:2.0 Sec2.0 Sec\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
