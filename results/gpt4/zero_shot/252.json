The readString method reads the first 4 bytes from the stream, which represent the size of the string in Little Endian format. It then reads the next 'size' number of 16-bit characters from the stream, and converts them to a String using the UTF-16LE charset, which stands for UTF-16 Little Endian. This approach allows you to read strings from a binary stream in the format you described."

I know the structure from some documentation and would like to use that stream as an ObjectInputStream, but before I can call any self made readObject methods, this approach fails, due to java.io.StreamCorruptedException: invalid stream header. What's the best way to populate java objects from such a byte stream?BTW: Data is coming in as LittleEndian, texts as 16bit chars preceeded by 4 byte size info, e.g.   03 00 00 00 41 00 62 00 63 00   (hex)would result in \"Abc\"\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
