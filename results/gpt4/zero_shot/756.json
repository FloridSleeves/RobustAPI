I am trying to create a function that creates a file with the path/file name of the string path. Here's my code:public static void CreateFile(String path) throws FileNotFoundException, UnsupportedEncodingException {    PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(path, \"UTF-8\");    writer.close();}What did I do wrong? Shouldn't it create a file? \nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
