The Iterator.next() method returns the next element in the iteration, but it returns it as an Object type. If you are iterating over a HashMap, each element is a Map.Entry object. Therefore, you need to cast the returned Object to Map.Entry so that you can use it as such in your code. If you don't do this, you will get a compile error because Java is a statically typed language and requires explicit type casting."
