This byte array is then read into a ByteArrayInputStream. A GZIPInputStream is created from the ByteArrayInputStream to handle the gzip compression. A byte array of size 4 is created to read 4 bytes at a time from the GZIPInputStream. The InputStream.read method is used to read 4 bytes at a time into the buffer array. The ByteBuffer.wrap method is used to create a ByteBuffer from the byte array, and the order method is used to specify that the bytes are in little-endian order. The getInt method is then used to convert the 4 bytes into an integer. This process is repeated until all bytes have been read from the GZIPInputStream. The resulting integers are the GID's."

Based on the TMX guide, in order to get the GID's I have to first base64 decode the string, then gunzip the resulting data if the compression attribute is set to \"gzip\" as in the above example. Finally, you can read 4 bytes at a time for each GID from the beginning of the data stream until the end.I think I've figured out the base64 decoding and 'gunzip' but the result from the code below is 27,0,0,0 repeating. I think the output is supposed to be (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) Thanks! public static void main( String[] args ) { String myString = \"H4sIAAAAAAAAAO3NoREAMAgEsLedAfafE4+s6l0jolNJiif18tt/Fj8AAMC9ARtYg28AEAAA\"; byte[] decode = Base64.decodeBase64(myString); ByteArrayInputStream byteArrayInputStream = new ByteArrayInputStream(decode);  GZIPInputStream gzipInputStream; int read; try {      gzipInputStream = new GZIPInputStream(byteArrayInputStream);      InputStreamReader inputStreamReader = new InputStreamReader(gzipInputStream);      BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(inputStreamReader, 4);      while ( ( read = bufferedReader.read() ) != -1 )      {           System.out.println(\"read :\" + read);      } } catch (IOException e) {      e.printStackTrace(); } }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
