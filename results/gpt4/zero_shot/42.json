This will match any application that can view any type of file. It then queries the PackageManager for any activities that can handle this intent. The result is a list of ResolveInfo objects, each representing an application that can handle the intent. The code then iterates over this list, calling loadLabel on each ResolveInfo object to get the user-friendly name of the application, and adds these names to an ArrayList. This ArrayList can then be used to populate a ListView or other UI element. The ApplicationInfo.loadIcon API is not used in this code, as it is not necessary to get the names of the applications. If you wanted to display the icons of the applications as well, you could call info.activityInfo.loadIcon(pm) inside the loop."

If the file were an image I would do something like this normally to show all applications capable of viewing the image.Intent intent = new Intent();intent.setAction(android.content.Intent.ACTION_VIEW);intent.setDataAndType(Uri.fromFile(file), \"image/*\");context.startActivity(intent);However say I have an unknown file how could I list all applications able to view a file so the user can select the appropriate application to open the file in my application.I also need the titles listed in an arraylist if possible so I can list them in a listview. Thank you for any help with getting a list of applications capable of viewing a file===================================EditAlright well something easier how can i get the applications from the above intent into an arraylist i could just do image/* audio/* etc and add them all to a list and then list them in a listview and that would solve my problem\nPlease using this api: ApplicationInfo.loadIcon.\nAnswer:"
