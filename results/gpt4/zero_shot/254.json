It uses a buffer to read and write data in chunks instead of byte by byte, which is more efficient. The size of the buffer is 1024 bytes, but you can adjust it according to your needs.\n\nThe function first skips the start bytes if the start is greater than 0. Then it enters a loop where it reads from the InputStream into the buffer and writes from the buffer to the OutputStream. The number of bytes to read at each iteration is the minimum of the buffer size and the remaining bytes to read (end - totalBytesRead). The loop continues until it has read and written the desired number of bytes (end) or there are no more bytes to read (is.read returns -1)."
