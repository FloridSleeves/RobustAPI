This method reads up to `buffer.length` bytes of data from the input stream into an array of bytes. An attempt is made to read as many as `buffer.length` bytes, but a smaller number may be read. The number of bytes actually read is returned as an integer.\n\nThis method blocks until input data is available, the end of the stream is detected, or an exception is thrown.\n\nWe are using a `ByteArrayOutputStream` to collect the data into a byte array. The `write` method of `ByteArrayOutputStream` is used to write `len` bytes from the specified byte array starting at offset `0` to this byte array output stream.\n\nFinally, we use the `toByteArray` method of `ByteArrayOutputStream` to create a newly allocated byte array. Its size is the current size of this output stream and the valid contents of the buffer have been copied into it."
