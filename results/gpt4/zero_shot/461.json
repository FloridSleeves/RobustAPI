When you declare your Iterator as `Iterator it`, it defaults to `Iterator<Object>`. This means that when you call `it.next()`, it returns an Object, not a Staff object. This is why you are getting an incompatible types error when you try to assign the result of `it.next()` to a Staff variable. To fix this, you need to declare your Iterator with the type of objects it will be iterating over, like so: `Iterator<Staff> it`. This way, `it.next()` will return a Staff object, which can be assigned to your Staff variable without any issues."

I can't understand why this is; the values in my map are Staff objects and it.HasNext() should be returning them to be stored in the staffMember variable, which should be fine to my knowledge?? Help much appreciated. Collection <Staff> staffList = staff.values();          Iterator it = staffList.iterator ();         while ((isJobAssigned = false) ||it.hasNext())         {             Staff staffMember = it.next();              if ((staffMember instanceof Typist) && (jobType.equalsIgnoreCase(\"Typist\")))             {                 newJob.setJobState (\"Assigned\");                 staffMember.setState(\"Working\");                 return newJon.getJobNo() + \" Staff allocated: \" + staffMember.getName () + \", ID: \" + staffMember.getId();                }\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
