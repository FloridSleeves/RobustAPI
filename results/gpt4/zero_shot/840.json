In your code, it is called immediately after the methods to get heart rate and ECG data. This might be the reason why the progress dialog is not showing up. The progress dialog is dismissed before it even has a chance to display. You should call ProgressDlg.dismiss() after the data has been downloaded and saved, not immediately after calling the methods to download the data."
