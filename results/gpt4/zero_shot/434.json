We then populate the card array with Card objects. After that, we convert the card array to a List using Arrays.asList() method. We then shuffle this list using Collections.shuffle() method. After shuffling, we populate the HashMap with the shuffled list of cards. The keys are incremented in each iteration, and the values are the shuffled cards. The Iterator.next API is not directly used in this solution, but it is implicitly used in the for-each loop when iterating over the shuffled list of cards."

I have initialized the hashmap with keys from 0-51 and the values are array of Card, as followsCard [] card = new Card[52]for (int i=1; i<=13; i++)    for (int j=0; j<4; j++)        card[++index] = new Card( ((i*10)+j) );and I populate the hashmap as follows:for (int i=1; i<=13; i++)    for (int j=0; j<4; j++)        deck.put( ++key, card[++index] );Now, what I want to do is to shuffle the values side of the hashmap, i do not want,for an example, the key[1] corresponds to card[0] and key[1] corresponds to card[1]. I want, for an exampel, the key[1] corresponds to card[38]. I want the values side to be shuffled. I tried the following:Collections.shuffle(card,new Random()); But it seems it accepts only ArrayList and List. \nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
