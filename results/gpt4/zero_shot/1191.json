The StringTokenizer constructor takes two parameters: the string to be split and the delimiter. In this case, the delimiter is \":\". The nextToken() method is then used to get the next token (substring) from the string. The first call to nextToken() will return the first part of the string (\"Fruit\") and the second call will return the second part of the string (\" they taste good\"). We then use the setText() method to set the text of the TextViews to these strings. The trim() method is used to remove the leading space from the second string."

I would like to split up the CurrentString using the : as the delimiter.So that way the word \"Fruit\" will be split into its own string and \"they taste good\" will be another string.And then i would simply like to use SetText() of 2 different TextViews to display that string. What would be the best way to approach this? \nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
