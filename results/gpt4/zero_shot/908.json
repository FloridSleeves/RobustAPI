The modified code reads all lines from the file into an ArrayList, excluding those that contain \"char-15\". Then it opens a FileOutputStream and writes all lines from the ArrayList back to the file. The method `String.getBytes()` is used to convert the string to a byte array, which can be written to the file by the FileOutputStream. The line separator is also written to the file after each line to ensure the lines remain separated."

I can't do this manually as there are well over 5000 files.How can I make it delete this specific line in all of the files?\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:"
