Then we convert the map's entry set to a list, which allows us to shuffle the entries using the Collections.shuffle method. After shuffling the list, we create a new LinkedHashMap (which maintains the insertion order) and populate it with the shuffled entries. Finally, we use an Iterator to iterate over the shuffled map's entry set and print each key-value pair. The Iterator.next method is used to retrieve the next entry in the set during each iteration."

Data is actually based on key-value structure.Like;100 \"white\"200 \"black\"300 \"red\"and like that. What I want to do is to change the key-value pairs according to I don't know yet, some algorithm.But they need to be shuffled like this, but shuffling need to be not random, so I can revert data when I need.100 \"red\"200 \"white\"300 \"black\"I don't really know how my approach should be to the solution. Should I use HashTable or something, and how can I shuffle them dynamically?Any help is appreciated\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
