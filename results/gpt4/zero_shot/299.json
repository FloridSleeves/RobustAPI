The `generateCombinations` method is the public API that takes a list of lists and returns a list of all combinations. It initializes an empty list of combinations and an empty current combination, then calls the helper method `generateCombinationsHelper`.\n\nThe `generateCombinationsHelper` method is a recursive method that generates all combinations of elements from the given lists. It takes the lists, the result list, the current combination, and the current index as parameters. If the current index equals the size of the lists, it means we have a complete combination, so it adds the current combination to the result list and returns. Otherwise, it iterates over the elements of the list at the current index, adds each element to the current combination, and makes a recursive call to generate the combinations for the next index. After the recursive call, it removes the last element from the current combination to prepare for the next iteration. \n\nThe `Iterator.next` API is not directly used in this code, but it is implicitly used in the for-each loop to iterate over the elements of the list."

If you think of the Object objects as integers, you could see it like this :{{1,2},{10,20,30},{100}}I need to get all possible lists containing exactly one element of each list, that is, come up with this :{{1,10,100},{1,20,100},{1,30,100},{2,10,100},{2,20,100},{2,30,100}}Of course you don't know at compiling time how much items the lists will contain, so you cannot rely on an overlapping of for loops...How would you come up with this? Time constraints are not relevant to my problem because the lists will likely contain few elements.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
