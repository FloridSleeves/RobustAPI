Including the SQL file with the apk is not the best option. It's better to use SQLite database which is a lightweight database system that Android supports. You can create a SQLite database, insert your data into it, and then query the data when you need it. This is more efficient and secure than including a raw SQL file.\n\n2. If you still want to include the SQL file in the apk, you can put it in the assets folder. But remember, this is not the recommended way.\n\n3. The code above shows how to get strings from a SQLite database and store them in an ArrayList. The `db.query()` method is used to query the database. It returns a Cursor object which can be used to navigate through the result set. The `cursor.getString()` method is used to get the string data from the specified column. The data is then added to the ArrayList."
