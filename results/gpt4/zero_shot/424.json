The `EvenIterator` takes an existing iterator over integers as an argument in its constructor. It uses this iterator to find the next even number (if one exists) and stores it in the `nextEven` variable. The `hasNext` method checks if there is a next even number, and the `next` method returns the next even number and advances the iterator to the next even number. The `advanceIterator` method is used to find the next even number and store it in `nextEven`. If there are no more even numbers, `nextEven` is set to `null`."

I am given an iterator for a list of integers. I need to write a function that returns takes this iterator as argument and returns the iterator for even numbers only. I was told, I cannot modify the original list of numbers. Hence, removing odd numbers from the list is not the solution. Please advise. Thanks.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
