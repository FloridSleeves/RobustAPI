It generates a CSV file for download. The filename of the file is dynamically generated based on the offer type. The Content-Disposition response header is used to prompt the browser to download the file instead of displaying it. The Content-Type response header is set to \"text/csv\" to inform the browser about the type of the file. \n\nThe PrintWriter.write method is used to write the content of the file to the response. The flush method is called to ensure that any buffered output is written out, and the close method is called to close the PrintWriter and free up any resources associated with it.\n\nThe issue you're facing with Firefox might be due to the browser not correctly interpreting the Content-Type. By explicitly setting it to \"text/csv\", the browser should correctly identify the file as a CSV file and handle it accordingly."

On chrome, it directly downloads the file as a *.csv format and when the user opens it, it will use Excel automatically to open the file, if they already have installed and this is the right behavior I wanted to have.However, on firefox, it prompts a save as window with open with and save options. If I use open with option, it tells me the filename is filename.csv but the type is chrome htm file. I haven't mentioned htm anywhere in my code and I dont know why its trying  to open it as htm instead of csv file. Once it tries to open it, it brings excel application and the contents are in a bad format.Is there a way to avoid this problem on firefox ?Thanks\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
