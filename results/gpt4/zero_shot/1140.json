For each line, it uses a StringTokenizer to split the line into tokens. It then retrieves the course code, day of the month, and head count from the tokens. It uses a HashMap of HashMaps to store the attendance for each course on each day. The outer HashMap's keys are the days of the month, and its values are another HashMap. The inner HashMap's keys are the course codes, and its values are the total attendance for that course on that day. If a day of the month is not already in the outer HashMap, it adds a new HashMap for that day. It then retrieves the inner HashMap for that day and adds the head count for the course. If the course is not already in the inner HashMap, it uses a default value of 0. Finally, it prints out the attendance for each course on each day."

From my thinkering, this involves either reading the file a lot of times (ew!) or loading the three salient values (day, course, headcount) into some sort of array and operating on that instead.  Despite being fairly familiar with what a multi dimensional array is, this one has repeatedly caused my head to implode.  I've got the pseudo code for this program written out in front of me and my mind draws a blank when it comes to the line that defines the array.  The dayOfMonth can remain a string because it'll only be compared to another string. The courseCode obviously needs to be a string, too.  However, the headCount ideally would be numeric; it'll be added to as each line of the file is processed. The relationship between the three is basically that there can be many courseCodes per dayOfMonth, but only one headCount per courseCode as I'll be adding to it as I read it all into the array.So, in derpspeak, this is how it should roughly look:{String dayOfMonth = {{String courseCode}, {int headCount}}}The two issues I have here, are...a) that I'm not sure how to actually code this kind of funky array in there andb) as I can't really wrap my brain around it to begin with, there's a really good chance that I've essentially just designed something completely wrong for what I need.  Or impossible.  Both?For example, the array will start off empty.  I'd want to add a dayOfMonth, courseCode and headCount to start it off.  But I couldn't just go array.add(dayOfMonth) because it's expecting an array, leading me to suspect I should be using something else.  Argh!Oh god my brain. \nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
