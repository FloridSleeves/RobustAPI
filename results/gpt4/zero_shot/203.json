It then calculates the modulus of the range to get a value within the desired range. If the value is not within the desired range, it discards the value and reads another 8 bytes from the InputStream. This process repeats until a suitable value is found. This method avoids wasting random bits and does not bias the results towards lower values."

Both the domain and the range are integers (more correctly, longs and not Z). What's an algorithm to do this?Implementation-wise, I have a function with this signature:long doRead(InputStream in, long rangeStart, long rangeEnd);in is based on a CSPRNG (fed by a hardware RNG, conditioned through SecureRandom) that I am required to use; the return value must be between rangeStart and rangeEnd, but the obvious implementation of this is wasteful:long doRead(InputStream in, long rangeStart, long rangeEnd) {    long retVal = 0;    long range = rangeEnd - rangeStart;    // Fill until we get to range    for (int i = 0; (1 << (8 * i)) < range; i++) {        int in = 0;        do {            in = in.read();        // but be sure we don't exceed range        } while(retVal + (in << (8 * i)) >= range);        retVal += in << (8 * i);     }    return retVal + rangeStart;}I believe this is effectively the same idea as (rand() * (max - min)) + min, only we're discarding bits that push us over max. Rather than use a modulo operator which may incorrectly bias the results to the lower values, we discard those bits and try again.  Since hitting the CSPRNG may trigger re-seeding (which can block the InputStream), I'd like to avoid wasting random bits.  Henry points out that this code biases against 0 and 257; Banthar demonstrates it in an example.First edit: Henry reminded me that summation invokes the Central Limit Theorem.  I've fixed the code above to get around that problem.Second edit: Mechanical snail suggested that I look at the source for Random.nextInt().  After reading it for a while, I realized that this problem is similar to the base conversion problem.  See answer below.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
