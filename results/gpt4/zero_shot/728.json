The FileWriter is initialized with two parameters: the file name and a boolean indicating whether or not to append to the file. If the boolean is true, the file is appended to; if it is false, the file is overwritten. The PrintWriter is used to write the string to the file. The loop runs 10 times, each time creating a string and writing it to the file. After all strings have been written, the writer is closed to free up resources."
