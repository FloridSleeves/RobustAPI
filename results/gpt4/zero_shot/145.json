The flip() method in ByteBuffer class sets the limit to the current position and then sets the position to zero. This prepares the buffer to be written. After writing, you need to clear the buffer to make it ready for reading again. Also, you should close the channels after you are done with them to free up system resources."

I tried reading a file using fileinputstream and file channel. I could not find out the bug in the following code. It runs successfully but file has not been transferred. New file is created with zero bytes. Please have a look at the code and check what went wrongpublic class FileTest{    public static void main(String[] args)    {           try {            File file = new File(\"sss.jpg\");            FileChannel inChannel=new FileInputStream(file).getChannel();            //FileChannel inChannel = in.getChannel();            ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024);            while(inChannel.read(buffer) > 0) {                FileChannel outChannel=new FileOutputStream(\"sss1.jpg\",true).getChannel();                outChannel.write(buffer);            }        }        catch(IOException ex) {}    }}\nPlease using this api: FileChannel.write.\nAnswer:"
