It overrides the `read` methods to limit the number of bytes read from the input stream. The `remaining` variable keeps track of how many bytes are left to read. When `remaining` reaches 0, the `read` methods return -1 to indicate the end of the file (EOF). The `read(byte[] b, int off, int len)` method also ensures that it does not read more bytes than remaining. The `close` method is overridden to close the underlying input stream when done."

So that the client code should see EOF once 100th byte is reached.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
