The ArrayList is used to map the nodes of the linked list. The 'moveToEnd' function is used to move a node with a specific ID to the end of the list. The 'List.get' method is used to access the node in O(1) time. If the node is not already at the end, it is removed from its current position and added to the end of the list."

I know that if i traverse the list to find a certain node it would take O(n) time so I want to map the nodes to an array list where I can access the nodes in O(1) time.I'm really unsure how I would do this mapping. I would like to see an example of how this can be done.Edit:I would like to be able to access any node in the linked list so I can move the nodes around in O(1) time.Example: Move node with ID 5 to end of list in O(1) time. Edit 2: I uploaded a picture example of what I'm trying to accomplish\nPlease using this api: List.get.\nAnswer:"
