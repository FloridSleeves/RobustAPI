The PrintWriter does not need to be flushed automatically after every write operation, which can be controlled by the autoFlush parameter in the PrintWriter constructor. If autoFlush is set to false, the PrintWriter will not be flushed automatically. However, you can manually flush the PrintWriter by calling the flush method. This will flush the PrintWriter but not the underlying OutputStream. If you want to avoid flushing the underlying OutputStream, you can wrap it in a \"flush protector\" OutputStream."

However flushing the underlying OutputStream has a big performance hit.Does a PrintWriter / PrintStream need to be flushed.If I need to flush the PrintStream / PrintWriter; can I do so without flushing the underlying OutputStream, or will I need to create a \"flush protecter\" OutputStream to wrap the underlying stream?To try to be a little clearer on this I want to implement public void writeSomeString(OutputStream foo);But this method may be called many times for the same OutputStream (foo).  Each call will have to construct its own PrintWriter.  I know it's ugly to do so but I have no control over the interface or the creation of foo.I'm trying to avoid each method having to flush foo just to flush its own PrintWriter / PrintStream.So I want to:public void writeSomeString(OutputStream foo) {    PrintStream s = new PrintStream(foo);    s.println(\"bar\");    // other code}I want to completely avoid this method flushing foo \nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
