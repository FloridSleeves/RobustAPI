In your case, you are using it to retrieve values from the 'omahaMap' HashMap. The performance of the get operation should be constant time O(1) if the hash function disperses the elements properly among the buckets. However, the performance can be affected by several factors such as the initial capacity of the HashMap, load factor, and the size of the HashMap. \n\nIn your case, the slower performance when reading the HashMap from a file could be due to the overhead of deserialization. When you read the HashMap from a file, Java has to convert the serialized data back into a HashMap object, which can be a time-consuming process. This overhead could be the reason why the lookups are slower when you read the HashMap from a file compared to when you create it yourself.\n\nAlso, the way you are measuring the time might not be accurate. System.nanoTime() can give you nanosecond precision, but not necessarily nanosecond accuracy. It's also affected by system clock changes. A more reliable way to benchmark your code would be to use a library designed for this purpose, such as JMH (Java Microbenchmark Harness)."

Creating it takes about 50-55 seconds, so I decided to serialize it and save it to a file. Reading from the file takes about 16-17 seconds now.The only problem is that lookups seems to be slower this way. I always thought that the hashmap is read from the file into the memory, so the performance should be the same compared to the case when I create the hashmap myself, right? Here is the code I am using to read the hashmap into a file:File file = new File(\"omaha.ser\");FileInputStream f = new FileInputStream(file);ObjectInputStream s = new ObjectInputStream(new BufferedInputStream(f));omahaMap = (HashMap<Long, Integer>) s.readObject();s.close();300 million lookups take about 3.1 seconds when I create the hashmap myself, and about 8.5 seconds when I read the same hashmap from file. Does anybody have an idea why? Am I overlooking something obvious? EDIT:I \"measured\" the time by just taking the time with System.nanotime(), so no proper benchmark method used. Here is the code:public class HandEvaluationTest{    public static void Test()    {        HandEvaluation.populate5Card();        HandEvaluation.populate9CardOmaha();        Card[] player1cards = {new Card(\"4s\"), new Card(\"2s\"), new Card(\"8h\"), new Card(\"4d\")};        Card[] player2cards = {new Card(\"As\"), new Card(\"9s\"), new Card(\"6c\"), new Card(\"2h\")};        Card[] player3cards = {new Card(\"9h\"), new Card(\"7h\"), new Card(\"Kc\"), new Card(\"Kh\")};        Card[] table = {new Card(\"2d\"), new Card(\"2c\"), new Card(\"3c\"), new Card(\"5c\"), new Card(\"4h\")};        int j=0, k=0, l=0;        long startTime = System.nanoTime();        for(int p=0; p<100000000; p++)    {           j = HandEvaluation.handEval9Hash(player1cards, table);            k = HandEvaluation.handEval9Hash(player2cards, table);            l = HandEvaluation.handEval9Hash(player3cards, table);        }        long estimatedTime = System.nanoTime() - startTime;        System.out.println(\"Time needed: \" + estimatedTime*Math.pow(10,-6) + \"ms\");        System.out.println(\"Handstrength Player 1: \" + j);        System.out.println(\"Handstrength Player 2: \" + k);        System.out.println(\"Handstrength Player 3: \" + l);    }}The big hashmap work is done in HandEvaluation.populate9CardOmaha(). The 5-card one is small. The code for the big one: public static void populate9CardOmaha()        {            //Check if the hashmap is already there- then just read it and exit            File hashmap = new File(\"omaha.ser\");            if(hashmap.exists())            {                try                {                    File file = new File(\"omaha.ser\");                    FileInputStream f = new FileInputStream(file);                    ObjectInputStream s = new ObjectInputStream(new BufferedInputStream(f));                    omahaMap = (HashMap<Long, Integer>) s.readObject();                    s.close();                }                catch(IOException ioex) {ioex.printStackTrace();}                catch(ClassNotFoundException cnfex)                {                    System.out.println(\"Class not found\");                    cnfex.printStackTrace();                    return;                }                return;            }    // if it's not there, populate it yourself    ... Code for populating hashmap ...    // and then save it to file          (            try            {                File file = new File(\"omaha.ser\");                FileOutputStream f = new FileOutputStream(file);                ObjectOutputStream s = new ObjectOutputStream(new BufferedOutputStream(f));                s.writeObject(omahaMap);                s.close();            }            catch(IOException ioex) {ioex.printStackTrace();}        }When i am populating it myself (= file is not here), lookups in the HandEvaluationTest.Test() take about 8 seconds instead of 3. Maybe it's just my very naive way of measuring the time elapsed?\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:"
