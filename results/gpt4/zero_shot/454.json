We then shuffle this list to get a random order of these numbers. We create an iterator from this list. We then iterate over the 2D array, and for each element, we use the `next()` method of the iterator to get the next number from the shuffled list. This ensures that each number from 0 to 99 appears exactly once in the 2D array. Finally, we print the array to verify the result."

I currently have it filed with random numbers within the correct range, but I just cant think of a solution to have non duplicates. How could i do this using very basic java methods? I have not yet learned anything such as arraylists, or anything like that, only the very basic methods. \nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
