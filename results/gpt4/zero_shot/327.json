When you declare an Iterator without a type, it defaults to Iterator<Object>, which is why you're getting an incompatible types error when trying to assign it.next() to a variable of type E. To fix this, you should specify the type of the Iterator when you declare it, like so: `Iterator<E> it = this.iterator();`. This way, the compiler knows that the Iterator is supposed to return elements of type E, and it.next() can be assigned to a variable of type E without any issues."
