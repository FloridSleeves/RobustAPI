This is why only the last line is being written. To fix this, the PrintWriter should be opened before the loop starts. Also, the PrintWriter should be closed after the loop to ensure that all data is written to the file. In the method writetotext, instead of using print method, we use write method as per the API requirement. The flush method is called to ensure that the data is immediately written to the file."
