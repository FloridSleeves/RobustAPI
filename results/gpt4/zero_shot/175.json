However, you can create a wrapper class that contains both an InputStream and an OutputStream. In the provided code, the `InputOutputStream` class is created to hold both an InputStream and an OutputStream. The `func` method is then created to either open a file stream and convert it to an `InputOutputStream` or make an `InputOutputStream` from a string based on the condition. The `InputStream.read` API is used implicitly when data is read from the `FileInputStream` or `ByteArrayInputStream`."

It's only InputStream and OutputStream and its variations (like InputDataStream, OutputDataStream, etc). Is there one? I need a stream which supports both read and write operations.How can I make an InputOutputStream from file?How can I make an InputOutputStream from string?For C++ InputOutputStream is a std::iostream. And I can convert std::fstream or std::stringstream to it without any problems. Is it reachable in Java?Thanks.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
