This means that if the `writeLine` method is called while the `run` method is executing, it will wait until the `run` method has finished before it starts executing. This ensures that the `PrintWriter` is not closed while it is being used to write to the file.\n\nThe `PrintWriter.write` method is used instead of `PrintWriter.println` to write the string to the file. The `write` method does not append a newline at the end of the string, unlike `println`. If you want to append a newline at the end of each string, you can add it manually like this: `writer.write(line + \"\\n\");`.\n\nThe `openFileWriter` method is also modified to check if the `PrintWriter` is not null before calling the `close` method. This is to prevent a `NullPointerException` if the `PrintWriter` is null when the method is called."

(writer.close())How can i wait to the ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor to finish creating the file before start writing\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
