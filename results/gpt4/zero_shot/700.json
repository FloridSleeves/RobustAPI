In the constructor of `StringPrinter`, you need to initialize the `items` array. Also, you were asked to use the `PrintWriter.write` method instead of `PrintWriter.println`. The `write` method does not automatically append a newline character, so you need to add that manually. Finally, it's a good practice to close the `PrintWriter` after you're done using it to free up system resources and to ensure that all changes are written to the file."
