In your code, I replaced FileWriter with PrintWriter. The write() method of PrintWriter is used to write a string to the file. It works similarly to the write() method of FileWriter. The rest of your code remains the same. The PrintWriter class automatically flushes the output after every invocation of write(), print(), or format(). Therefore, you don't need to flush it explicitly."

I cannot get know how to save the results in output file that second array is save in a lower line.This is how it saves:dist[0 10 13 10 6 18 ] pred[-15 2 5 1 4 ] I want it to save like this:dist[0 10 13 10 6 18 ]pred[-15 2 5 1 4 ]CODE:try{outputFile = new File(\"Out0304.txt\");out = new FileWriter(outputFile);out.write(\"\\n\" + \"dist[\");out.write(\"\\n\");for (Top way : tops){    out.write(way.shortest_path + \" \");}out.write(\"]\\n\");out.write(\"\\n\");out.write(\"\\n\" + \"pred[\");for (Top ww : tops){    if (ww.previous != null) {        out.write(ww.previous.number + \" \");    }            else{        out.write(\"-1\");    }}out.write(\"] \\n \");out.close();}  catch (IOException e){System.out.println(\"Blad: \" + e.toString());}}}\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
