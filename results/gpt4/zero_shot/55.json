In your case, you are trying to read a line from a file where data is separated by '#'. So, when it tries to read beyond the available tokens in a line, it throws `NoSuchElementException`. \n\nTo fix this, you can use `BufferedReader.readLine()` which reads a line of text. A line is considered to be terminated by any one of a line feed ('\\n'), a carriage return ('\\r'), or a carriage return followed immediately by a linefeed. This will ensure that you are reading the entire line of data, and then you can use a `Scanner` to parse each line separately."
