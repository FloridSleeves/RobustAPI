This is why it hangs indefinitely. To solve this, you can use `StringWriter` and `StringReader` to first convert the properties to a string on the client side, then send this string over the socket. On the server side, you read the string and load the properties from it. This way, the termination character of the string (newline) will signal `Properties.load()` to stop reading."

That being said, I'm stuck. Googling for java Properties over Sockets results in a lot of irrelevant things. I'm trying to transfer a Properties object over a socket. The API says it can be done with a Stream or a Writer/Reader, but I can't get it to work. I can do it manually, that is, if I read the file line by line and pass it through a PrintWriter.On the client side I've got roughly:socket = new Socket(host, port);outStream = socket.getOutputStream();out = new PrintWriter(outStream, true);in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file));...props.load(reader);props.store(out, null);On the server side the receiving bits look like:out = new PrintWriter(sock.getOutputStream(), true);inStream = sock.getInputStream();in = new BufferedReader( new InputStreamReader(inStream));...props.load(in); // hangs// doesn't get to code here...In this case it hangs at the props.load(in). Instead of doing props.load(in), I read it in line by line to make sure props.store(out, null) was working, and the data looks like its being transferred.Is there something about load/store I don't understand, or is it an issue with the Stream/Writer/Reader?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
