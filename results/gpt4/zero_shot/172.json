In the provided code, we first create a File object pointing to the XML file. Then, we create a FileInputStream object to read from this file. We create a byte array of the same length as the file, and use the read method to read the file contents into this array. After reading, we close the FileInputStream. Finally, we convert the byte array into a String using the UTF-8 encoding and print it. This way, we can access the contents of the XML file. However, this does not directly give you the contents of the current line being parsed by the SAX parser. For that, you would need to manually keep track of the line numbers while reading the file."

Getting access to file lines in the currently parsing xml file: :When parsing an XML document, you can set a locator, the locator will tell you what current line and column number your are currently on when different events fire. I am wondering, how can I get the contents of the line, do I have to pass the file, read it into an array myself, isn't this already done by the sax handler, since it is giving me access to the locator, there has to be away to also access the file that the handler is currently working with. Thanks! ::::::::::::::::::::::::::EDIT:::::::::::::::::::I am trying to echo an xml file and want doctype declarations to be included: <!DOCTYPE employee [<!ELEMENT employee (Name, Dept, Title)><!ELEMENT Name (#PCDATA)> <!ELEMENT Dept (#PCDATA)><!ELEMENT Title (#PCDATA)> ]>There is a public void startDTD(String name, String publicId, String systemId);and a public void endDTD();Where you can use the locator to get current line and column, and read from file.There are a couple of things that the SAX parser does not fire events on or give sufficient information as to what was in the read XML file. \nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
