In this case, it is used to return the next StudentObj in the list. This method will return different StudentObj for each call, as long as there are more students in the list. If there are no more students, it will return null. This way, you can make concurrent calls to getStudentInfo and each call will return a different student. Note that you need to pass the iterator as a parameter to the getStudentInfo method."

I am using Hibernate (to which I am relatively new) on top of oracle database.I was thinking in lines of locking student1 row and returning that row, but I am not very conversant with locking in hibernate.On Client Side time t1: getStudentInfo() (work on student1) |  getStudentInfo() //Call concurrently (work on student2)time t1+10sec: getStudentInfo (work on student3)time t1+20sec: getStudentInfo (work on student4)First call should be able to work on student1 and second concurrent call should be able to work on student2.Edit: Made changes based on comments. ( I cannot edit the query and clients getStudentInfo cannot pass the id if that helps).\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
