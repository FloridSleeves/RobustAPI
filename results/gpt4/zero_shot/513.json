The `add` method adds an object to the map or increments its count if it's already present.\n\nThe `iterator` method returns a custom `Iterator` that iterates over the entries in the map. The `hasNext` method checks if there are more elements to iterate over. If the current value is 0, it means that we have iterated over the current key the required number of times, so we move to the next entry in the map.\n\nThe `next` method returns the current key. If the current value is 0, it fetches the next entry from the map and updates the current key and value. It then decrements the current value, as we have iterated over the current key once.\n\nThis approach is more efficient than creating an `ArrayList` because it doesn't require additional space proportional to the number of elements and their counts. It only requires a constant amount of additional space for the iterator and its fields."

I have an add method where if you add an object the object will be the key, and its value will be 1 if the object is not currently in the list. However if you add object that is currently in the list its value will be bumped up by 1. So if I added 10 strings which were all the same, the key would be that string and the value will be 10. I understand in practice when I iterate through the map, there is actually only one object to iterate, however, I am trying to create a inner class that will define an iterator that will iterate the same object however many times its value is. I can do this by simply using for loops to construct an appropriate ArrayList and just create an iterator for that, but that is too inefficient. Is there an easy or more efficient way of doing this?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
