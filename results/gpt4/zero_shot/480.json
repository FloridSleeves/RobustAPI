We then shuffle the list to randomize the order of the choices. We create an iterator for the list and use it to fill the array with the randomized choices. The Iterator.next() method is used to retrieve each choice from the list in the order they appear after the shuffle. This ensures that the array is filled with a random choice at each index, but once the array is filled, there is an even split among the two choices."

Let's also assume for clarity that you can only choose between two things to put as a given item in the array. How would you go about putting a random choice at a given index in the array but once the array is filled you have an even split among the two choices?If there are any answers with code, Java is preferred but other languages are fine as well.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
