This could be due to a variety of reasons, but given that you're having trouble with the iterator test, it's possible that you're trying to call `next()` on your iterator without first checking if there is a next element with `hasNext()`. \n\nThe `next()` method in the Iterator API is used to return the next element in the iteration. If the iteration has no more elements, it throws `NoSuchElementException`. Therefore, before calling `next()`, you should always call `hasNext()` to check if there is a next element. If `hasNext()` returns true, you can safely call `next()`. If it returns false, you've reached the end of the iteration and should not call `next()`. \n\nIn your case, you should ensure that your code correctly uses the `hasNext()` method before calling `next()`. If you're still having trouble, you might want to print out the elements of your list to ensure they're what you expect."

My professor send us a JUnit test so we can know if our code is working correctly. Now every method has passed the test except the iterator test which fails the test. It appears to be a java.lang.AssertionError and I cant seem to figure out a way of fixing it. If you could see the error and point it out to me would be awesome. Thanks in advance\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
