This method blocks until some input is available. In the provided code, we are reading the file in chunks of 1024 bytes (you can adjust this size as needed) and summing up the total bytes read. This will give you the compressed size of the gzip section. Please replace \"path_to_your_gzip_file\" with the actual path to your gzip file."

I am able to know the location of the start of the GZIP section using magic number and the GZIPInputStream in Java. However, I need to know the compressed size of the gzip section. GZIPInputStream would return me the uncompressed file size.Is there anybody who has an idea? \nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
