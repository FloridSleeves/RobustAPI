When you create a PrintWriter object and pass the socket's output stream to it, the PrintWriter wraps around the socket's output stream. \n\nWhen you call the close() method on the PrintWriter object, it not only closes itself but also closes the underlying output stream of the socket. This is because the PrintWriter's close() method calls the close() method of the underlying output stream, which in turn closes the associated socket.\n\nOn the other hand, when you call the shutdownOutput() method on the socket, it only closes the output stream of the socket but keeps the socket alive. This allows you to continue reading from the socket's input stream.\n\nSo, if you want to write to a socket's output stream and then read from its input stream, you should use the socket's shutdownOutput() method instead of closing the PrintWriter. This will ensure that the socket remains open for reading even after you're done writing."
