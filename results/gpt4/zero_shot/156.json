This method blocks until some input is available. In your case, you are reading the data into a byte array of size 1024. The read method returns the total number of bytes read into the buffer, or -1 if there is no more data because the end of the stream has been reached. You are correctly using this method to read the data and write it to the BufferedOutputStream. However, you were adding 1024 to your progress counter regardless of how many bytes were actually read. Instead, you should add the number of bytes that were actually read (x). Also, you should initialize the ProgressDialog before starting the download and set its maximum value to the total size of the file. Then, in the onProgressUpdate method, you should update the progress of the ProgressDialog with the number of bytes that have been downloaded so far."

I want to display a ProgressDialog which should have a progress bar to show the status of the download. I'm using the onProgressUpdate() function for that and implemented a call to publishProgress() in my doInBackground() function. However, the progress dialog only pops up after downloading the file. My code:protected Long doInBackground(URL...urls) {    for (int i = 0; i < urls.length; i++) {        url = urls[i];        try {            URLConnection conn = url.openConnection();            conn.connect();            totalSize = conn.getContentLength();            BufferedInputStream bis = new BufferedInputStream(url.openStream());            FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().getPath() + \"/forvo_temp.mp3\");            BufferedOutputStream bos = new BufferedOutputStream(fos,1024);            byte [] data = new byte[1024];            int x=0; int c=0;            while((x=bis.read(data,0,1024))>=0){                bos.write(data,0,x);                c += 1024;                publishProgress(c);            }        } catch (Exception e) {            e.printStackTrace();        }    }    return 0L; // Don't know what to do with this}protected void onProgressUpdate(Integer...args) {    pd = ProgressDialog.show(context, \"Downloading...\", \"Downloading...\", true, false);    pd.setProgress(args[0] / totalSize);}I guess the whole file is downloaded when I call new BufferedInputStream(url.openStream()). How can I monitor the download progress?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
