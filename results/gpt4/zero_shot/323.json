It starts by checking if the list is not empty. If it's not, it creates an iterator for the list and stores the first value as the previous value. Then, it enters a while loop that continues as long as there are more elements in the list. In each iteration of the loop, it gets the next value from the iterator and compares it to the previous value. If they are not equal, it increments the count and updates the previous value to the current value. This way, it counts the number of times the value changes in the list."
