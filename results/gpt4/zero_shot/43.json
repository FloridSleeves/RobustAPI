If the app is installed on the device, it will return the ApplicationInfo object, from which we can load the app icon using the loadIcon() method. If the app is not installed, it will throw a NameNotFoundException. So, by catching this exception, we can know whether the app is installed or not. However, this method also relies on the package name of the app. If the package name changes in the future, you will need to update it in your code."
