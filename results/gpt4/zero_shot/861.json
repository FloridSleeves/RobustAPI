It starts reading from the current file pointer position and advances the file pointer for each byte read. \n\nIn your code, `byte b1[] = new byte[ 15 ];` creates a byte array of size 15, and `file.readFully( b1 );` reads 15 bytes from the file into `b1`. Then, `firstName = new String( b1, 0 );` creates a new String from the byte array, starting from index 0. \n\nThe same process is repeated for `lastName` with a new byte array `b2`. The reason it doesn't give the same value is because the file pointer moves forward as bytes are read. So when `file.readFully( b2 );` is called, it starts reading from where the last read operation left off, not from the beginning of the file.\n\nThe size of the byte arrays (15 in this case) is determined based on the expected size of the data in the file. If the actual data is shorter, the remaining bytes in the array will be filled with zeros. If the data is longer, it will be truncated. \n\nFinally, `balance = file.readDouble();` reads the next 8 bytes from the file, interprets them as a double, and assigns the value to `balance`. The file pointer is then advanced by 8 bytes."
