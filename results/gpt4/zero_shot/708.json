It first gets the PrintWriter from the response. Then it wraps the response in a CharResponseWrapper. The filter chain is then invoked with the wrapped request and response. The content of the wrapped response is then converted to a string. If the content type of the response is \"text/html\" and the content is not blank, it writes the content up to the closing body tag to a CharArrayWriter, then writes the desired HTML chunk and the closing body and html tags. The content length of the response is then set to the length of the string representation of the CharArrayWriter's content. This content is then written to the PrintWriter. If the content type of the response is not \"text/html\" or the content is blank, it simply writes the content of the wrapped response to the PrintWriter. Finally, it closes the PrintWriter."

My goal is to append a chunk of HTML just before the closing </body> of all HTML responses.I'm working on a solution that extends the HttpServletResponseWrapper to use my own PrintWriter, then overriding the write methods thereon. Inside the write method I'm storing the last 7 characters to see if it's equal to the closing body tag, and then I write my HTML chunk plus the closing body tag, before continuing normal write operations for the rest of the document.I feel that somebody must have solved this problem already, and probably more elegantly than I will. I'd appreciate any examples of how to use a servlet filter to insert content into a response.UPDATEDResponding to a comment, I am also trying to implement the CharResponseWrapper from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/filters-137243.html. Here is my code:PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();CharResponseWrapper wrappedResponse = new CharResponseWrapper(        (HttpServletResponse)response);chain.doFilter(wrappedRequest, wrappedResponse);String s = wrappedResponse.toString();if (wrappedResponse.getContentType().equals(\"text/html\") &&        StringUtils.isNotBlank(s)) {    CharArrayWriter caw = new CharArrayWriter();    caw.write(s.substring(0, s.indexOf(\"</body>\") - 1));    caw.write(\"WTF</body></html>\");    response.setContentLength(caw.toString().length());    out.write(caw.toString());}else {    out.write(wrappedResponse.toString());}out.close();I am also wrapping the request, but that code works and shouldn't affect the response.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
