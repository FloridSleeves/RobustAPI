Instead, you can use the Jacob library, which is a Java-COM Bridge. It allows you to call COM Automation components from Java. In the code above, we first create an ActiveXComponent for Access. Then we set the visibility of Access to false, open the database, run the macro, and finally quit Access. Please replace \"C:\\\\path\\\\to\\\\your\\\\database.accdb\" with the actual path to your Access database and \"YourMacroName\" with the name of your macro."
