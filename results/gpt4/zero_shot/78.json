In this case, it is used to send a newline character ('\\n') to signify the end of the XML message. This allows the server to know when the message has ended without needing to wait for an EOF signal. The DataOutputStream.flush method is then called to ensure that the data is sent immediately, rather than waiting for the buffer to fill up. This should prevent the server from going into deadlock as it is no longer waiting for an EOF signal."

It wait for EOF but I can't send it because if I use out.close();orskt.shutdownOutput();I close the Socket and I must keep this connection alive.I can't send '\\0' becouse I get Parse Error in the server.How can I do it? Can I \"close\" the output stream without closing the socket?RESOLVEDI've created new class XMLStreamOutput and XMLStreamInput with advanced Stream gesture.\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:"
