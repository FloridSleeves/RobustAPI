We are reading each line from the BufferedReader and writing it to the file using the PrintWriter. The `System.lineSeparator()` is used to add a new line after each line of output. The PrintWriter is closed in the finally block to ensure that the writer is closed even if an exception occurs. This will ensure that all the data is written to the file before the program ends."

However, when I try to write it to a file, the file is empty.PrintWriter writer = null;writer = new PrintWriter(\"grep__output\", \"UTF-8\");writer.println(s);writer.close();Also, I tried to directly writing to file in the above while (previously creating the file), but it's the same.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
