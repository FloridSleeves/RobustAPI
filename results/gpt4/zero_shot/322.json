It has a constructor that takes an Iterator of Item objects as an argument and assigns it to the delegate field. The hasNext() method simply delegates the call to the backing iterator. The next() method, however, wraps the Item object returned by the delegate's next() method in a FacadeItem object before returning it. This way, the FacadeItemIterator iterates over FacadeItem objects, even though it is backed by an Iterator of Item objects."
