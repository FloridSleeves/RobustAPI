The iterator, on the other hand, checks for modifications to the list during iteration, and if it detects that the list has been modified outside of its own remove() or add() methods, it throws a ConcurrentModificationException. This is to prevent unpredictable behavior from concurrent modification during iteration. \n\nIn the second loop, you are trying to remove an element from the list while iterating over it using a for-each loop, which implicitly creates an Iterator. This is not allowed and results in a ConcurrentModificationException. \n\nThe correct way to remove elements from a list during iteration is to use the Iterator's own remove() method, as shown in the provided code. This ensures that the iterator is aware of the modification and can adjust accordingly, preventing the ConcurrentModificationException."

Thanks. \nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
