It uses a `TimerTask` to periodically check if the file's last modification time has changed. If it has, it writes the new modification time to a log file using `PrintWriter.write`. The `PrintWriter` is created with a `FileWriter` that appends to the end of the log file. The `Timer` is set to run the task every second."
