It throws NoSuchElementException if the iteration has no more elements. The method does not take any parameters. \n\nIn the context of your question, the use of Collection<? extends T> instead of Collection<T> in the Collections.min method allows for greater flexibility. It means that the method can accept a collection of any type that extends or implements T. This is known as an upper bounded wildcard. \n\nFor example, if T is Number, the method could accept a Collection<Integer>, Collection<Double>, etc., because Integer and Double are subclasses of Number. If the method signature was Collection<T>, it would only accept a Collection<Number>, which is less flexible. \n\nThe Iterator.next() method can be used to iterate through such a collection, regardless of the specific type of elements it contains, as long as they extend or implement T."

What's the added benefit?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
