When the button is clicked, it creates a new PrintWriter object that writes to a file named \"tableData.txt\". It then loops through each row and column of the jTable, writing the value at each cell to the file, separated by commas. After writing all the data, it closes the PrintWriter. If the file cannot be found or opened, it catches the FileNotFoundException and prints the stack trace."
