The `myParser` object is an instance of a class that implements the `Iterable` interface. Inside the loop, we are doing some operations which might throw an exception. If an exception is thrown, it is caught and handled inside the catch block. The `Iterator.next` method is implicitly called when the foreach loop gets the next element from the `myParser` object. If an exception occurs during this call, it will be caught and handled by the catch block, allowing the loop to continue with the next element."

Occasionally lines will be syntactically bogus, but that doesn't necessarily mean that we shouldn't keep reading the file.My parser implements Iterable, but dealing with the potential exceptions means writingfor (Iterator iter = myParser.iterator(); iter.hasNext(); ) {  try {    MyClass myClass = iter.next();    // .. do stuff ..  } catch (Exception e) {    // .. do exception stuff ..  }}.. nothing wrong with that, but is there any way of getting exception handling on the implicit individual iter.next() calls in the foreach construct?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
