The Map.getOrDefault method is used to get the current count of each number, and if the number is not yet in the map, it defaults to 0. After counting the frequency of each number, the code then iterates over the values in the map and increments the result counter for each number that appears exactly twice. This approach is more efficient than the ones provided in the question because it only requires two passes over the data: one to count the frequencies and one to count the pairs."

May be not so good if n is quite big I guess...Well, 2 questions:am I understanding good how to \"measure\" the efficiency of the code?there's a better way to count the number of unique pairs in a given array?EDIT:Damn I've just posted and I'm already swamped by answers! Thanks! I'll study each one with care, for the time being I say I don't get those involving HashMap: out of my knowledge yet (hence thanks again for the insight:o) )\nPlease using this api: Map.get.\nAnswer:"
