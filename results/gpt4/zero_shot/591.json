For each element in the lists, a new JPanel is created with a FlowLayout, which arranges its components from left to right. Two JTextFields are created for each element, one for the ID and one for the time, and they are added to the row panel. The row panel is then added to the main panel. The `List.get` method is used to retrieve each element from the lists. The `getMainPanel` method returns the main panel, which can be added to a JFrame or another container to be displayed."
