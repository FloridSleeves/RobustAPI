The compression is done using the ImageWriter and ImageWriteParam classes from the javax.imageio package. The ImageWriter is obtained by calling the ImageIO.getImageWritersByFormatName method with the format name of the image (in this case, \"jpg\"). The Iterator.next method is used to get the first ImageWriter from the returned Iterator. The compression quality is set using the setCompressionQuality method of the ImageWriteParam class. The quality value is a float between 0 and 1, where 1 means highest quality (least compression) and 0 means lowest quality (highest compression). The compressed image is written to an ImageOutputStream, which is created by calling the ImageIO.createImageOutputStream method with an OutputStream to the file where the compressed image should be saved."

Improve this question                    From our application we fetch images (jpeg/png) from a third party service, after download we want to save these images as compressed.Can any one please guide how to compress images in Java ?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
