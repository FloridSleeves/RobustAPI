This way, you can ensure that E will always be a type that \"has a constructor that takes a Bar\", or more accurately, is a Bar or a subclass of Bar.\n\nIn the `next()` method, you simply return the next element from the inner iterator, which is guaranteed to be of type E. This way, you don't need to create a new instance of E.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that E is a subclass of Bar. If this is not the case, you might need to rethink your design. For example, you could create a factory interface that creates instances of E from a Bar, and pass an instance of this factory to the constructor of your FooIterator."

My code looks something like this:public class FooIterator<E> implements Iterator<E> {  public FooIterator(Collection<Bar> bars) {    innerIterator = bars.iterator();  }  @Override  public boolean hasNext() {    return innerIterator.hasNext();  }  @SuppressWarnings(\"unchecked\")  @Override  public E next() {    Bar bar = innerIterator.next();    return new E(bar);  }  @Override  public void remove() {    throw new UnsupportedOperationException(\"Don't remove from FooIterator!\");  }  private Iterator<Bar> innerIterator;}...except, of course, this doesn't work because I can't instantiate a new E from a Bar.I would only ever use this with an E that has a constructor that takes a Bar. Is there any way to \"prove\" that to the compiler, or to just throw a runtime error if E doesn't have an appropriate constructor?Or perhaps I'm just not using the right design pattern here? I've been doing a lot of C++ recently, and I feel like I might be approaching this the wrong way.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
