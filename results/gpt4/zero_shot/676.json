The `write` method of the `PrintWriter` object should be used to write text to the file. Also, the `printf` and `println` methods of the `PrintWriter` object are not needed in this case, so they have been replaced with the `write` method. The `flush` method is called after each `write` to ensure that the text is actually written to the file before the program continues. Finally, the `PrintWriter` object is closed with the `close` method to release the resources it is using."
