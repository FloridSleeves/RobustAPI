For each line, we calculate its offset from the beginning of the file by adding the length of the line (plus 1 for the newline character) to the current offset. We store these offsets in a List. Later, we can use the List.get method to retrieve the offset of any line. For example, offsets.get(0) will give us the offset of the first line, offsets.get(1) will give us the offset of the second line, and so on."
