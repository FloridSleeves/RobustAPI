In the given code, we first create a PriorityQueue and add some elements to it. Then we remove an element from the PriorityQueue. After that, we create an Iterator for the PriorityQueue and use the next() method to iterate over the elements. For each element, we perform an update operation. However, this does not reheapify the PriorityQueue. If you need to maintain the heap property after modifying elements, you would need to remove the elements, modify them, and then re-insert them into the PriorityQueue. Java does not have a built-in Fibonacci heap implementation. You would need to implement it yourself or find a third-party library."

When I initially insert the elements into the priority queue the ordering is maintained by the data structure. Now after a remove operation I update some of the references which are being held by the priority queue. Ideally this requires a reheapify operation on the priority queue but as is obvious since I am modifying selected references externally a reheapify cannot be triggered. So what is the best way to ensure that I am able to get the advantage of a heap like fast extract max in the presence of modifications to arbitrary elements inside the queue? I see I need a better data structure?To be more specific I need an implementation of something like a Fibonacci heap in Java.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithmIs that available?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
