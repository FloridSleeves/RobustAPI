The number of bytes actually read is returned as an integer. This method blocks until input data is available, the end of the stream is detected, or an exception is thrown. \n\nIn the code above, we first get the InputStream from the socket. Then we create a byte array to store the data read from the InputStream. We then call the read method on the InputStream, passing the byte array as the argument. The read method returns the number of bytes actually read, which we store in the 'length' variable. \n\nFinally, we convert the byte array into a String using the String constructor that takes a byte array, the offset, the length, and a Charset as arguments. We specify StandardCharsets.UTF_8 as the Charset to ensure the String is encoded in UTF-8."

The following method works fine:BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream(), \"UTF8\"));main.title = in.readLine();but then I need a int java.io.InputStream.read(byte[] b, int offset, int length) method which does not exist for a BufferedReader. So then I tried to take a DataInputStream DataInputStream in2 = new DataInputStream(socket.getInputStream());but everything it reads is just rubbish. Then I tried to use the readLine() method from DataInputStream but this doesn't give me the correct UTF8 string.You see my dilemma. Can't I use two readers for one InputStream? Or can I convert the DataInputStream.readLine() result and convert it to UTF8?Thanks,Martin\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
