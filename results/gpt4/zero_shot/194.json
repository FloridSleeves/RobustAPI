The `exec` method takes an array of strings as an argument where the first string is the command and the rest are the options. The output of the command is read from the `InputStream` of the `Process` object. The `read` method of `InputStream` is used to read the output byte by byte until it returns -1, which indicates the end of the stream. The output is then printed to the console."
