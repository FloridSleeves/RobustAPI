In Java, `else` is used when you want to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false. But in your case, you are checking a condition `(op.equals(\"*\"))` which requires `else if`. So, you need to replace `else (op.equals(\"*\"))` with `else if (op.equals(\"*\"))`. Also, you need to initialize `double answer = 0;` at the beginning. This is because the variable `answer` might not have been initialized if none of the conditions in your if-else statements are met."
