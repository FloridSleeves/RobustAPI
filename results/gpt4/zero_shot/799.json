Then, we create a PrintWriter object using the output stream of the process. We use the PrintWriter's println method to write the commands \"cd C:/\" and \"dir\" to the command line. The flush method is called to ensure that any buffered data is actually written out, and then we close the PrintWriter."

For example:// Execute commandString command = \"cmd /c start cmd.exe\";Process child = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(command);// Get output stream to write from itOutputStream out = child.getOutputStream();out.write(\"cd C:/ /r/n\".getBytes());out.flush();out.write(\"dir /r/n\".getBytes());out.close();The above opens the command line but does not execute cd or dir. Any ideas? I am running Windows XP, JRE6.(I have revised my question to be more specific. The following answers were helpful but do not answer my question.)\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
