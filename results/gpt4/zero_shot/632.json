We are passing a new `Comparator` as an argument to the `sort()` method. This `Comparator` is comparing two HashMaps, `lhs` and `rhs`, which are elements of the `SecondArray` ArrayList. \n\nThe `compare()` method is overridden to compare the values associated with the key \"number\" in both HashMaps. The `Map.get()` method is used to retrieve these values. The `compareTo()` method is then used to compare these values. \n\nIf the value in `lhs` is less than the value in `rhs`, it will return a negative number. If the value in `lhs` is greater than the value in `rhs`, it will return a positive number. If the values are equal, it will return 0. \n\nThe `Collections.sort()` method uses this information to sort the `SecondArray` ArrayList in ascending order based on the values associated with the key \"number\"."
