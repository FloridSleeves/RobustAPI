This method reads the next byte of data from the input stream and returns an int in the range of 0 to 255. If no byte is available because the end of the stream has been reached, the returned value will be -1. In the provided code, we are reading the output of the 'javac MyFrog.java' command and printing it to the console. If there are any errors during the compilation, they will be printed to the console."
