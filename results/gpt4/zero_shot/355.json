Generics provide a way for you to communicate the type of a collection to the compiler, so that it can be checked. Once the compiler knows the element type of the collection, the compiler can check that you have used the collection consistently and can insert the correct casts on values being taken out of the collection.\n\nIn your case, `Iterator<String> iter = my.iterator();` is preferred because it specifies that the Iterator will be iterating over Strings. This way, when you call `iter.next()`, it will automatically return a String, and you won't need to cast it. If you use the former form, `iter.next()` will return an Object, and you'll need to cast it to a String manually."
