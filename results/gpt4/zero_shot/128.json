The error message \"EROFS (Read-only file system)\" indicates that you are trying to create a file in a location that is read-only, which is not allowed.\n\nIn Android, you cannot create files in the root directory, which is what you are trying to do when you specify the file path as \"jokesBody1.bjk\". Instead, you should be creating your file in a directory that your app has write access to, such as the app's internal storage directory.\n\nYou can get the path to this directory using the `getFilesDir()` method, like so:\n\n```java\nFile file = new File(getFilesDir(), \"jokesBody1.bjk\");\n```\n\nThis will create the file in a directory that your app has write access to, which should resolve the issue."

I really can't understand what is wroong. I have this premission in my manifest:<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\" />Can someone give me a clue? I know that I'm missing something small, but I really can't spot it.Here is how I write the file:/* Write content to a file */    private void writeToFile(ArrayList<String> list, Context cont) {        File file = new File(\"jokesBody1.bjk\");             FileOutputStream fos;        if(list != null){        try {                           fos = cont.openFileOutput(\"jokesBody1.bjk\", Context.MODE_PRIVATE);                ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(fos);                out.writeObject(list);                out.close();        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {                e.printStackTrace();        } catch (IOException e) {                e.printStackTrace();         }        }else{            try {                file.createNewFile();                fos = openFileOutput(\"jokesBody1.bjk\",Context.MODE_PRIVATE);                ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(fos);                out.writeObject(\"\");                out.close();        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {                e.printStackTrace();        } catch (IOException e) {                e.printStackTrace();         }        }    }\nPlease using this api: File.createNewFile.\nAnswer:"
