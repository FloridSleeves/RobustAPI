In this case, we are using it to break the string \"John 20150.00\" into two tokens: \"John\" and \"20150.00\". The nextToken() method is used to get the next token from the string. After breaking the string into tokens, we store the first token (the name) into a String variable and the second token (the number) into a double variable. The Double.parseDouble() method is used to convert the string representation of the number into a double."
