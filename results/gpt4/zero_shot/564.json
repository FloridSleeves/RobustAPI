In the provided code, an iterator is returned from the Zoo class's iterator method, which is then used to iterate over the Animal objects in the Zoo's private List. While returning an iterator does not directly expose the underlying List, it does allow for modification of the List's elements, which can be seen as breaking encapsulation to some extent. However, this can be mitigated by returning an unmodifiable view of the List or the Iterator."

Reason why I want to return iterator is to avoid defining setters and getters and removal methods. Does that break encapsulation?class Zoo{    private List<Animal> animalList;    public Zoo(){        animalList = new ArrayList<Animal>();    }    public void addAnimal(Animal animal){        animalList.add(animal);    }    public Iterator<Animal> iterator(){        return animalList.iterator();    }}class Animal{    private String name;    private double weight, height;    Animal(String name, double weight, double height){        this.name = name;        this.weight = weight;        this.height = height;    }}\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
