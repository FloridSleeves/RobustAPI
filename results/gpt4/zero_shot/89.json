On device A, we create a server socket that listens on port 8888. When device B connects to this server socket, we accept the connection and create a DataOutputStream. We then write the data we want to send to this stream.\n\nOn device B, we create a client socket that connects to device A's server socket. We then create a DataInputStream and read the data sent from device A. Note that you need to replace \"device A's IP address\" with the actual IP address of device A.\n\nThe DataOutputStream.write method is used to write data to the underlying output stream in a machine-independent way. In this case, it writes the data to the socket's output stream, which is then sent over the network to device B.\n\nPlease note that this is a very basic example and does not include any error handling or robustness features that a real-world application should have. Also, this code needs to be run in a separate thread from the UI thread to avoid blocking the UI."
