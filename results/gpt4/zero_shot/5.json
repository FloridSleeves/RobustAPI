Instead, you should pass the instance of the Activity to the class where you want to use it. In the code above, we are passing the instance of MenuActivity to the constructor of SearchView. Then, we are using this instance to call the findViewById method to initialize the searchButton. This way, you won't get a NullPointerException because the Activity has been properly initialized."
