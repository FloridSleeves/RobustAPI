For each line, it uses StringTokenizer to split the line into tokens (words) based on the space character. It then appends each token and a space to a StringBuilder. After all tokens in a line have been processed, it appends the additional string and a newline character to the StringBuilder. After all lines have been processed, it writes the contents of the StringBuilder back to the file, effectively adding the additional string to the end of each line.\n\nFor the additional question, you can insert a string into a line by appending it to the StringBuilder after a certain number of tokens have been processed. For example, to insert a string after the first token, you could modify the while loop as follows:\n\n```java\nint count = 0;\nwhile (st.hasMoreTokens()) {\n    sb.append(st.nextToken());\n    count++;\n    if (count == 1) {\n        sb.append(\" insertString\");\n    }\n    sb.append(\" \");\n}\n```\nThis will insert the string \"insertString\" after the first token of each line."

I don't want to delete the content, but simply add some string at the end of the line. Could you please show me a simple code for doing it? Ex, given data.txt file: aaa bbb ccceee fff gggResult after running the java program:aaa bbb ccc dddeee fff ggg hhhAdditional question : is there a simple way to \"insert\" in the line line of a given file some String? If yes, how to do it too?Result:aaa 111 bbb ccceee fff 222 gggThank you in advance for your help.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
