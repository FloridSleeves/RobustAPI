Every record has 6-8 attributes which are split by a single tab. I would like for starters to copy some given attributes in another file. So I would like a more elegant code than the above, for example if I want only the second and the last token from a total of 4:StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(line, \"\\t\");st.nextToken(); //get rid of the first tokenSystem.out.println(st.nextToken()); //show me the second tokenst.nextToken(); //get rid of the third tokenSystem.out.println(st.nextToken()); //show me the fourth tokenI'm reminding that it's a huge file so I have to avoid any redundant if checks.\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
