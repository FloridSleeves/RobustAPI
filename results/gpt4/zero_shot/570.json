Instead, you can use the same type for both the input and output of the BiFunction. The Iterator.next method is used to iterate over the elements of the collection. The reduceLeft method applies the BiFunction to the first element and the next element in the collection, and then updates the first element with the result. This process is repeated until all elements in the collection have been processed. The final result is the first element."

The compiler complains about the super token in <B super A> because you can't have lower-bounded type variables! Now how would I write this method in Java code without having to time-travel back to when generics didn't exist in the Java world?Yes, I know that you think I could use B extends A, but that is not the same thing, as shown by my implementation:public <R extends E> R reduceLeft(BiFunction<? super R, ? super E, ? extends R> mapper){    if (this.isEmpty())    {        return null;    }    Iterator<E> iterator = this.iterator();    R first = iterator.next(); // doesn't work, but would if R was a super-type of E (R super E)    while (iterator.hasNext())    {        mapper.apply(first, iterator.next());    }    return first;}Instead, I had to use this slightly more restricted version:public E reduceLeft(BiFunction<? super E, ? super E, ? extends E> mapper){    if (this.isEmpty())    {        return null;    }    Iterator<E> iterator = this.iterator();    E first = iterator.next();    while (iterator.hasNext())    {        first = mapper.apply(first, iterator.next());    }    return first;}\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
