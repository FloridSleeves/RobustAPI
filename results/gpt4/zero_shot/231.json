The `read` method is used in a loop to continuously read the output until the channel is closed. \n\nWhen the channel is closed, the `channel.getExitStatus` method is used to get the exit status of the command. If the command was successful, it will return 0. If there was an error, it will return a non-zero value.\n\nFinally, the `channel.disconnect` and `session.disconnect` methods are used to disconnect the channel and session respectively. This should kill the `tail -f` process on the server side. \n\nPlease note that the `tail -f` command will continue to run until it is explicitly killed or the session is disconnected. If you are still seeing the process running after disconnecting the session, it may be due to some other issue."
