We first create a `SecretKeySpec` with a 128 bit key and initialize a `Cipher` instance with \"AES/ECB/NoPadding\". We then create a `RandomAccessFile` instance in \"rw\" mode, which allows us to read and write to the file. We encrypt the text \"Hello, World!\" using the `Cipher.doFinal` method and then seek to the end of the file using `RandomAccessFile.seek` method. Finally, we write the encrypted text to the file using `RandomAccessFile.write` method and close the file. Note that this code uses \"NoPadding\" and assumes that the output data size is divisible by the block size."

Unfortunately, cryptography is not my strong side. Now I can write to file several messages and then close file. Then i can open it, append some messages, close again and after decryption I see padding bytes in the middle of file. Is there any way to work with encrypted file without having to decrypt it every time I want to append some messages?EDIT: little more details. Current implementation utlizes CipherOutputStream. As i understand there's no way to seek using it.Can i use 'NoPadding' option if i will control that output data size is divisible by block size?\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.write.\nAnswer:"
