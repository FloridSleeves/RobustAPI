We then enter an infinite loop where we continuously get tasks and submit them to the thread pool for execution. The getTask() method uses StringTokenizer to parse a string into tasks. The processTask() method is where you would implement your logic to process the task. This setup will keep the thread pool running indefinitely, processing tasks as they come in."

I'm trying to have a multi threaded environment that stays active so that I can just submit tasks and run them. I want to do this without the hassle of executing in a web server or application server. The idea was to use a java thread pool for this, but the issue here is that the pool stays open just until my main method finishes, after which obviously it closes and the program finishes. How can I prevent this from happening? I'm sure there are several options, some more naive than others (while true loops come to mind). Any ideas? Thanks. \nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
