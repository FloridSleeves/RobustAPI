InputStream.read() is thread-safe, meaning it can be used by multiple threads at the same time without causing race conditions. Therefore, if multiple threads invoke FileUtils.contentEquals() in parallel, each invocation will execute independently and the end result of each execution can be guaranteed without any race conditions. However, it's important to note that if the same InputStream is shared between threads and one of them modifies it (like closing it), then it will affect the other threads. In the provided code, each thread is using different InputStreams, so there won't be any issues."
