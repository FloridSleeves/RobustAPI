It returns the next byte of data, or -1 if the end of the file is reached. In the provided code, we are creating an InputStream to a file named \"file.txt\". Then, we read the first byte of data from the file. We continue to read bytes of data in a loop until the end of the file is reached (i.e., until input.read() returns -1). Each byte of data is cast to a char and printed to the console. Finally, we close the InputStream with input.close()."

Improve this question                    I am writing a back end program that telnets into a server, runs some commands and saves all the output from those commands.  Something just like Expect.I would like to use an open source solution that is well supported and runs with JDK 6.  I have found 3 options so far and would like some help deciding which one (or a better suggestion) to use.commons-net \u2013 This is very well supported but I having trouble getting a simple \u201cLog in and do \u2018ls\u2019\u201d command working.  I would prefer to use this library, if anyone can provide a simple example (and not the example that comes with it that takes input from the user) I would like to go that route.  If I\u2019m unable to use commons-net the next two options are:JExpect \u2013 This is not that hard to use, does what I need but how well supported is it?  Will it work with JDK 6, I think so.Java Telnet Application (jta26) \u2013 This was easy to use but I\u2019m not sure how versatile it is.  I didn\u2019t see any place to set a timeout value in the TelnetWrapper.  I also was not sure if this code is being maintained since the last update to the site was in 2005. (http://www.javassh.org)I know this is somewhat opinion oriented and hope SO is a good place to help me make a decision so I don\u2019t start down one road and find out later it\u2019s not what I\u2019m looking for.  Thanks.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
