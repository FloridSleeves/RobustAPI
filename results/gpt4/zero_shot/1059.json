In your for loop, you are creating a new array with a single element (the next token) and then trying to access it using the index y. This will only work when y is 0, and will throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException for any other value of y. \n\nTo fix this, you should first create an array with a length equal to the number of tokens, then fill this array with the tokens in the order they are given. After that, you can print the words in reverse order by iterating over the array backwards. This way, you are guaranteed that the index y is always a valid index of the array."

I wrote this real quick to try out a new IDE I heard about, and it's supposed to take an inputted string and return it with the words in reverse order, but it keeps on telling me that at some point one of the indices of the String[] have no value. import java.util.StringTokenizer;  import java.util.Scanner;  public class Example {    /**     * @param args     */    public static void main(String[] args) {        //set up input        Scanner input=new Scanner(System.in);        System.out.println(\"type something here\");        String sentence=input.nextLine();        //set up StringTokenizer        StringTokenizer tokens=new StringTokenizer(sentence);        //setup for loop        for(int y=tokens.countTokens()-1; y>=0; y--){            String[] word={tokens.nextToken()};            System.out.print(word[y]+\" \");        }    }}\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
