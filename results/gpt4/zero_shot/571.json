In this case, we are using it to iterate over a list of widgets. We first create an iterator from the list of widgets using Guava's Iterables.cycle method, which returns an iterable that cycles indefinitely over the input elements. Then, in the pickWidget method, we use the Iterator.next method to get the next widget in the list. If there are no more widgets, the method throws a NoSuchElementException. This way, we can cycle over the same list of widgets again and again, as the iterator will start over once it reaches the end of the list."

Apache's CircularFifoQueue seems close but no cigar, as I don't want anything popped off the queue, I just want it to cycle over the same list time and time again as it is called.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
