This method writes the string as a sequence of characters to the PrintWriter's output stream, which in this case is a FileOutputStream. This change should not affect the performance of the program, but it does make the code more concise and direct. The performance difference between the two servers could be due to a variety of factors, including differences in hardware, operating system scheduling, and JVM implementation."
