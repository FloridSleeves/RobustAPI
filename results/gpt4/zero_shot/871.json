This ensures that only one instance of SQLiteOpenHelper is created throughout the lifecycle of your application. You can create a static method (like getInstance()) in your SQLiteOpenHelper class that returns the single instance. \n\nIn your activities, you can get the instance of SQLiteOpenHelper by calling this static method. You can then use this instance to call getWritableDatabase() and query() methods. \n\nYou should call the close() method in the onDestroy() method of your activities. This ensures that the database is closed when the activity is destroyed. This is a good practice as it releases the resources used by the database, and prevents memory leaks."

Two activities must save some informations so I use in both a MySQLiteHelper to access the database.I read here that building SQLiteOpenHelper as static data member could be a good practice so I did this. The static factory method ensures that there exists only one DatabaseHelper instance at any time.I create in each activity a SQLiteOpenHelper that uses the method getWritableDatabase() but I don't know where to use the close() method. Should I put this method after every modification or once at the end of the activity ? Thank you =)\nPlease using this api: SQLiteDatabase.query.\nAnswer:"
