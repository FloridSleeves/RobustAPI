In the original code, these objects were declared at the class level but then redeclared in the constructor, which means the class-level objects were never initialized. This is why the NullPointerException was thrown when trying to use the PrintWriter object in the printExp method. \n\nIn the corrected code, the constructor no longer has the void keyword (which was incorrect syntax), and the File, FileWriter, and PrintWriter objects are not redeclared in the constructor, so the class-level objects are correctly initialized. \n\nThe printExp method now uses the PrintWriter.write method from the API you specified. This method writes a string to the output stream, so we need to convert the Expense object to a string using the toString method. We also add a newline character (\"\\n\") after each string to ensure each string is written to a new line in the file. \n\nFinally, the PrintWriter is closed after all the strings have been written to the file."
