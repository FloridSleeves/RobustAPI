First, we create a PrintWriter object and specify the file name (\"output.csv\") and the character encoding (\"UTF-8\"). Then, we use the write method to write the header, the data, and the footer to the file. Each write operation is followed by a newline character (\"\\n\") to ensure that the next write operation starts on a new line. Finally, we close the PrintWriter object to ensure that all changes are saved and resources are freed. If an error occurs during this process, it is caught and printed to the console."
