It then checks if these bytes correspond to the UTF-8 BOM. If they do not, it resets the InputStream to the start of the file. Then it reads the file line by line using a BufferedReader, effectively skipping the BOM if it was present."

Is there any other way I can do this with FileReader? I know that there is the BOMInputStream that should work, but I'd rather find a solution using FileReader.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
