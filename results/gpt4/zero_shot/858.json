It first calculates the size of the source file and the number of bytes each split file should contain. It then creates a new file for each split and writes the appropriate number of bytes to each file. The readWrite method is used to read from the source file and write to the destination file. If the source file size is not exactly divisible by n, the remaining bytes are written to an additional file."

Here is how I read the file:int n = 4;BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"file.csv\"));try {    String line = br.readLine();    while (line != null) {        line = br.readLine();    }} finally {    br.close();}How do I split the file - file.csv into n files?Note - Since the number of entries in the file are of the order of 100k, I can't store the file content into an array and then split it and save into multiple files.\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:"
