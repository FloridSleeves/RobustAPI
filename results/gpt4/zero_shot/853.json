The RandomAccessFile class allows us to move around a file and read from it or write to it as we please. We start by creating a new RandomAccessFile from the file we want to search. We then set our low and high pointers to the start and end of the file, respectively. We enter a while loop that continues until our low pointer is greater than our high pointer. In each iteration of the loop, we calculate the mid-point between our low and high pointers, seek to that position in the file, and read the line at that position. We then compare this line to the string we're searching for. If the line comes before our search string, we move our low pointer to the mid-point plus one. If the line comes after our search string, we move our high pointer to the mid-point minus one. If the line is equal to our search string, we've found our match and we break out of the loop. If we reach the end of the file without finding a match, our search string is not in the file."

A central component of the original program is a Perl module that does string prefix lookups in a +500 GB sorted text file using binary search (essentially, \"seek\" to a byte offset in the middle of the file, backtrack to nearest newline, compare line prefix with the search string, \"seek\" to half/double that byte offset, repeat until found...)I have experimented with several database solutions but found that nothing beats this in sheer lookup speed with data sets of this size. Do you know of any existing Java library that implements such functionality? Failing that, could you point me to some idiomatic example code that does random access reads in text files?Alternatively, I am not familiar with the new (?) Java I/O libraries but would it be an option to memory-map the 500 GB text file (I'm on a 64-bit machine with memory to spare) and do binary search on the memory-mapped byte array? I would be very interested to hear any experiences you have to share about this and similar problems.\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:"
