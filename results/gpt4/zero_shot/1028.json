The second parameter of the StringTokenizer constructor is \"+-*\", which are the delimiters, and the third parameter is true, which means the delimiters are also treated as tokens. Then, in the while loop, if the index is even, the token is added to the tokens list; if the index is odd, the token is added to the delimiters list. This way, the original indices of the tokens and delimiters are preserved. When you have a token index 'i', you can get the delimiter from index 'i' in the delimiters list without looping through all the delimiters."

The tokens go to an ArrayList, and the delimiters go to another. For example:this + is - an * inputThis sentence would be tokenized so that \"this\", \"is\", \"an\" and \"input\" would go to the token array while \"+\", \"-\" and \"*\" go to the delimiters array. Now, I need to store the original indices of these as well, so that the tokens would have indices 0, 2, 4 and 6 and the deliminators would have indices 1, 3 and 5. The normal solution would be to put them into the same array, but I need to keep them separated for performance reasons (e.g. to quickly check through the delimiters).How could this indexing be done so that when I have a token index 'i', I could easily get the deliminator from index 'i+1' without looping through all the delimiters?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
