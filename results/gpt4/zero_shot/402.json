Even though you are using a synchronized list, the iterator is not thread-safe. The iterator is fail-fast, which means it will throw ConcurrentModificationException if the list is modified while iterating over it. To avoid this, you need to synchronize the block of code where you are iterating over the list. This will ensure that the list is not modified by another thread while it is being iterated."

I use thread-safe collection and remove items through iterator. Collection used in only this thread.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
