This method returns a Process object. From this Process object, we are getting the InputStream. Then we are reading from this InputStream using the read() method until there is no more data to read (i.e., read() returns -1). The read data is then printed to the console. \n\nHowever, please note that you cannot execute a .sh file directly on a Windows system as .sh is a shell script for Unix-based systems. You would need a Unix-like environment on Windows, like Cygwin or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), to execute the .sh file."
