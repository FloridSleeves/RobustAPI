In this case, it is used to iterate over the collection of maps. The for loop is used to iterate until the given row number. The hasNext() method is used to check if there is a next element in the collection. If there is, the next() method is used to get the next map (which represents a row in the table). After the loop, we have the map representing the row we want. Then, we construct the column name based on the given column number and use the get() method on the map to get the value of the specific cell."

So Im stuck :(Any suggestions? thanks a lot!\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
