This is because the for-each loop internally uses an Iterator, and the Iterator is unaware of the modifications made directly to the list, which can lead to ConcurrentModificationException. However, you can remove items from a list while iterating over it using an Iterator directly. The Iterator interface provides a remove() method which removes the last element returned by the iterator. It can be called only once per call to next()."

Trying to remove it like in the sample code below doesn't want to work. How could I get to the iterator of current px object in this loop to remove it?    for( Pixel px : pixel){ [...]  if(px.y > gHeigh){     pixel.remove(pixel.indexOf(px)); // here is the thing     pixel.remove(px); //doesn't work either  }}\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
