We then create a new StringTokenizer object 'st' with the input string and a space as the delimiter. We also create a StringBuilder object 'sb' to store the result. We then enter a while loop that continues as long as there are more tokens in the string. In each iteration of the loop, we get the next token and check if it ends with \"-PRP\". If it does not, we append it to the StringBuilder. After the loop, we convert the StringBuilder to a string and remove any trailing spaces. This string is then printed to the console. This code will remove all words tagged with \"-PRP\" from the input string."
