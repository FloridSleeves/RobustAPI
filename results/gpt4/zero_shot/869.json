It first creates a new File object and gets its length. It then creates a byte array 'data' and a buffer 'buff' of the same length. It also defines a constant JUMP_LENGTH which is the number of bytes to jump each time (10KB in this case). A RandomAccessFile object 'raf' is then created with read/write access to the file. The code then enters a loop which continues until the end of the file is reached. In each iteration, it seeks to the current position 'i', reads data into the buffer, seeks back to the same position, and then writes the data. The position 'i' is then incremented by the step size (JUMP_LENGTH + data.length). After all data has been written, the RandomAccessFile is closed."

It looks like this: What I tried: FileInputStream is; FileOutputStream out; File input = new File(filePath); int fileLength = input.length(); int len = 0;    while (len < fileLength){        len += is.read(buff);        // write my data        out.write(data, 0, data.length);       // how to move is to read next 10kb???    }I wonder is there anyway to move the cursor reader to next amount of bytes? Or do I miss anything?Update:Thank to @DThought, here is my implementation:    File input = new File(filePath);    long fileLength = input.length();    byte[] data;    byte[] buff = new byte[data.length];    long JUMP_LENGTH = 10 * 1024;    RandomAccessFile raf = new RandomAccessFile(input, \"rw\");    long step = JUMP_LENGTH + data.length;    for (long i = 0; i < fileLength; i += step) {        // read to buffer        raf.seek(i);        raf.read(buff);        raf.seek(i); // make sure it move to correct place after reading        raf.write(data);    }    raf.close();And it worked well.\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.write.\nAnswer:"
