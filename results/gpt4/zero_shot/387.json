This method uses the `Iterator.next` API to iterate over the `activities` list. It adds the activities to a new list `recentActivities` until it reaches the specified limit or there are no more activities. This way, you can fetch the most recent activities up to a certain limit. However, this does not limit the size of the `activities` list stored in the database. It only limits the number of activities retrieved from the list."

Is it possible to automatically do it during any fetch from DB? (so that I don't have to limit the collection by hand in Java).@Entitypublic class Person {    @Id    @GeneratedValue    private Long id;    @OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL, fetch = FetchType.EAGER)    @OrderBy(\"timestamp DESC\")    @JoinColumn(name = \"PERSON_ID\")    private List<Activity> activities;    // other setters, getters, etc. }Essentially I'd like to keep, say, 20 entries in the ACTIVITY entries (dropping the oldest rows, when newer are inserted), but fetch only 5 latest. Is this possible?\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
