For each line, we create a `StringTokenizer` object, which breaks the line into tokens (in this case, integers separated by spaces). We then iterate over these tokens using the `hasMoreTokens` method. For each token, we convert it to an integer using `Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken())`. We only add the integer to the sum if it is in an odd position (i.e., it is the second, fourth, sixth, etc. integer in the line). We determine this by checking if the count of the tokens (which we increment with each iteration) is not divisible by 2 (`count % 2 != 0`). Finally, we print the sum of every second integer in the line."
