It uses the StringTokenizer class to split each line into tokens. The first token of the first line is the number of points (N), which is extracted by calling nextToken() and removing the first character 'N'. For each of the following N lines, it extracts the x and y values of each point by calling nextToken() twice. These values are used to create a new Point object, which is added to the list of points."

The data inside is as following,N12  3934  2312  225   77   1011  8  .  .  .left column contains the x value of each point. Right column contains y value of each point. N is the number of lines Point data that follow. I need to extract all the Point data and store it in a data structure(such as List). Is there any way I can do that?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
