It then iterates over each interface, ignoring any that are loopback interfaces or are not up. For each interface, it gets the list of `InetAddress` objects associated with that interface and iterates over them. For each `InetAddress`, it gets the host address (which is the IP address of the interface) and uses a `StringTokenizer` to split the IP address into its four octets. It then constructs the gateway IP by taking the first three octets of the IP address and appending \".1\" to the end. This assumes that your gateway is always at the \".1\" address in your subnet, which is a common convention but may not always be true."

I can get my IP easily enough. I can get my internet IP using a service on a website. But how can I determine my gateway's IP?This is somewhat easy in .NET if you know your way around. But how do you do it in Java?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
