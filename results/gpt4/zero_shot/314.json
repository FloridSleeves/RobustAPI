In your code, you are correctly using this method to get the first element of the set. The problem is not with the Iterator.next() method, but with the set.remove(obj) method. \n\nThe remove method removes the specified element from this set if it is present. If the element is not present, it will not remove anything. So, if the element returned by set.iterator().next() is not present in the set at the time of calling set.remove(obj), no element will be removed. \n\nAnother possible reason could be that the equals() and hashCode() methods are not properly overridden in the class of the objects contained in the set. The remove method relies on these methods to find the object to be removed. If these methods are not correctly implemented, the remove method might not be able to find the object.\n\nPlease check the implementation of equals() and hashCode() methods in the class of the objects contained in the set, and also make sure that the object returned by set.iterator().next() is present in the set at the time of calling set.remove(obj)."
