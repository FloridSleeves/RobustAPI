We are using a fixed thread pool with 6 threads to handle multiple clients. When a client connects, we submit a new task to the executor service to handle the client's messages. This task reads from the client's input stream using the `InputStream.read` method, stores the message in a table (not implemented in this code), and sends an acknowledgement back to the client. This allows the server to handle multiple clients concurrently."

Suppose there are 6 clients connected to the server at the same time and each of the clients are sending some commands to server at the same time. If these clients sending the message to server for every 1 second how can I handle the those messages from the 6 clients on the server side to store it in the table and the acknowledgement to each client. How can i handle these input from from the client. Whether I have to create 6 threads to handle these inputs from the client. Please give me a idea to approach this issue.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
