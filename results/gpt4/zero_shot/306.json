The \"super\" keyword is used in bounded wildcard parameters, not in type parameters. Instead, you can use \"extends\" keyword to achieve your goal. In this case, you can declare your iterator as `MyIterator<T extends Tree>`. This means that T can be any type that is a Tree or a subtype of Tree, which includes Maple. Then, you can create a new MyIterator with a List of Maples, and it will be treated as an Iterator of Trees or Plants, depending on the context. The Iterator.next method is used to return the next element in the iteration."

Does anyone know of a good way to accomplish the same thing?My motivation for asking is that I have a program that uses interfaces for its API. I want to have one method that returns an iterator of interfaces (for the API) and another that returns an iterator of the implementation classes (for internal use).\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
