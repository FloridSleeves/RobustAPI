We wrap it in an `InputStreamReader` to convert the byte stream to a character stream. Then we wrap the `InputStreamReader` in a `BufferedReader` to read the input line by line. The `readLine` method reads a line of text. A line is considered to be terminated by any one of a line feed ('\\n'), a carriage return ('\\r'), or a carriage return followed immediately by a linefeed. When the end of the stream has been reached, `readLine` returns null."
