We create a BufferedReader object and pass a FileReader object initialized with the file we want to read. Then, we use a while loop to read the file line by line until there are no more lines to read (when reader.readLine() returns null). Inside the loop, we check if the line equals the name of the method we want to execute. If it does, we call the method. After we finish reading the file, we close the BufferedReader using the close method to free up system resources. If an IOException occurs during this process, we catch it and print the stack trace."

I have the saved files set up so that on every line there is the name of a method in my Main program. What I need to do is to look in a certain line for text and execute the method that the text is referring to.\nPlease using this api: BufferedReader.readLine.\nAnswer:"
