It first checks if the set has at least one element, if not, it throws an exception. Then it gets the first element using iterator.next(). After that, it enters a loop where it continues to get the next element and operate on the current and next element until there are no more elements left in the set. The current element is then updated to be the next element for the next iteration. This way, it iterates through the set in pairs, as required."

By that I mean that each iteration has access to one element of the collection and the next element of the collection?For sorted Lists (and arrays), it can be done using an index into the collection: final int n = list.size(); assert 2 <= n; for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {    final Thing thing1 = list.get(i);    final Thing thing2 = list.get(i+1);    operateOnAdjacentPair(thing1, thing2); }But what about SortedSet? (for SortedMap you can use its entrySet(), which is equivalent to the SortedSet case).So, for example, if your sorted set contained the values {1, 2, 3, 4}, the iterations would be for the pairs (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), in that order.\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
