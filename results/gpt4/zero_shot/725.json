Then, we are converting the read line to uppercase using the `toUpperCase()` method of the `String` class. After that, we are creating a `PrintWriter` object and writing the uppercase string to the new file using the `write()` method of the `PrintWriter` class. Finally, we are closing the `PrintWriter` object using the `close()` method to ensure that all changes are saved to the file."

Below is part of the code (specifically the loop): // Read lines from the file until no more are left.  while (inputFile.hasNext())  {      // Read the next name.     String friendName = inputFile.nextLine();      // Need line to make all letters uppercase  }  System.out.print(\"Enter the saved file name: \");  String filename2 = keyboard.nextLine();When I run it now: I am able to open the first text file and a second txt file is created, but there is no letters in the new file. \nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
