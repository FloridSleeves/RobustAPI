However, it can be used to parse the Authorization header of HTTP requests when implementing token-based authentication. In the provided code, a string representing an Authorization header is tokenized using StringTokenizer. The 'Bearer' and the actual token are separated and can be used for further processing like validating the token. \n\nTo secure your RESTful web services, you should consider using standard security protocols such as OAuth2 or JWT (JSON Web Tokens). These protocols provide a way to authenticate and authorize users and protect your web services from unauthorized access. \n\nPlease note that securing web services is a complex task that involves more than just parsing tokens. It includes setting up secure communication channels (HTTPS), validating and renewing tokens, managing user sessions, and more. It is recommended to use established libraries and frameworks for this purpose."

We are creating web services which is running in glassfish and we are calling these restful web services directly from our jsp deployed in tomcat . I have to make our web service secure such that no other person or organisation can hit(use) our web services from there application . Can you tell me how to do these ?????? \nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
