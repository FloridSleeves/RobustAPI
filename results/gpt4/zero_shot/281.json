This could be due to a variety of reasons, but given that you're having trouble with the iterator test, it's possible that you're trying to call `next()` on your iterator without first checking if there is a next element with `hasNext()`. \n\nThe `next()` method in the Iterator API is used to return the next element in the iteration. If the iteration has no more elements, it throws a `NoSuchElementException`. To avoid this, you should always call `hasNext()` before calling `next()`. `hasNext()` returns true if the iteration has more elements. \n\nIn the provided code, we first get an iterator from the contact list. Then, we loop through the iterator using a while loop. In each iteration, we first check if there are more elements in the iterator using `hasNext()`. If there are, we get the next element using `next()` and do something with the contact. This way, we avoid calling `next()` when there are no more elements, which would cause a `NoSuchElementException`."

My professor send us a JUnit test so we can know if our code is working correctly. Now every method has passed the test except the iterator test which fails the test. It appears to be a java.lang.AssertionError and I cant seem to figure out a way of fixing it. If you could see the error and point it out to me would be awesome. Thanks in advance\nPlease using this api: Iterator.next.\nAnswer:"
