First, we create a `RandomAccessFile` object in read/write mode (`\"rw\"`). Then, we encrypt the message using a hypothetical `encryptMessage` method. We use the `seek` method to move the file pointer to the end of the file (i.e., the position at which the next write will occur, which is the current length of the file). Finally, we write the encrypted message to the file and close the file. This way, we can append to the encrypted file without having to decrypt it every time. \n\nRegarding your question about using 'NoPadding', it is possible if you ensure that the output data size is divisible by the block size. However, you should be aware that if you use 'NoPadding' and the data is not a multiple of the block size, you will get a `BadPaddingException`."

Unfortunately, cryptography is not my strong side. Now I can write to file several messages and then close file. Then i can open it, append some messages, close again and after decryption I see padding bytes in the middle of file. Is there any way to work with encrypted file without having to decrypt it every time I want to append some messages?EDIT: little more details. Current implementation utlizes CipherOutputStream. As i understand there's no way to seek using it.Can i use 'NoPadding' option if i will control that output data size is divisible by block size?\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.write.\nAnswer:"
