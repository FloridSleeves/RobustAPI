Then, we are combining these bytes into a single integer. After that, we are shifting the integer 7 bits to the right to get the 17 bits. The '0xFF' is used to mask the byte when it is promoted to int. The '<<' and '>>>' are bitwise shift operators. The '<<' operator shifts the bits of the number to the left and fills 0 on voids left as a result. The '>>>' operator shifts the bits of the number to the right and fills 0 on voids left as a result. The 'is.read(bytes)' method reads up to 'bytes.length' bytes of data from this input stream into an array of bytes. If no byte is available because the end of the stream has been reached, the value -1 is returned."
