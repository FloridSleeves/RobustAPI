The issue you are facing is that the images are not being displayed when the HTML page is rendered.\n\nTo fix this issue, you need to make sure that the images are accessible from the server. Since you are embedding the images, CSS files, and JavaScript files in the JAR file, you can use the ResourceHandler in Jetty to serve those resources.\n\nYou can update your code as follows:\n\n```java\n// Set handler 1 (Display Html)\nServletContextHandler context = new ServletContextHandler(ServletContextHandler.SESSIONS);\ncontext.setContextPath(\"/\");\ncontext.addServlet(new ServletHolder(hws),\"/hello\");\n\n// Set handler 2 (For the images, CSS files, and JavaScript files)\nResourceHandler resourceHandler = new ResourceHandler();\nresourceHandler.setResourceBase(\"/path/to/resources\"); // Set the path to your embedded resources\n\n// Attach handlers to server\nHandlerList handlerList = new HandlerList();\nhandlerList.setHandlers(new Handler[]{context, resourceHandler});\nmyServer.setHandler(handlerList);\n```\n\nIn this code, the ResourceHandler is added as a handler along with the ServletContextHandler. The `setResourceBase` method is used to set the path to the folder containing the embedded resources.\n\nThen, in your HTML code, you can reference the images using the `/img` path:\n\n```html\n<img src=\"/img/img.jpg\">\n```\n\nMake sure that the path to the images in your JAR file matches the path specified in the `setResourceBase` method.\n\nThis should allow Jetty to serve the embedded images, CSS files, and JavaScript files while running the servlet."

In this case, you can modify your servlet code as follows:\n\nout.println(\"<img src=\\\"/img/img.jpg\\\">\");\n\nThis should properly display the image in the output of the servlet.\n\nIf you have multiple images, css files, and javascript files, you can create subfolders within the \"resources\" folder to organize them.

All of them will be embeded in the Jar file.Does anyone have any experience in displaying images in the ouput of a servlet, and where the images are located within the jar file ?Thanks\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
