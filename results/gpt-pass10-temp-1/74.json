One way to achieve this is by using a common parent class or interface for the output streams and dynamically assigning the appropriate stream based on your needs. Here's an example:\n\n// Declare the common output stream variable\nOutputStream outputStream = null;\n\n// Create the socket and input stream\nSocket socket = new Socket(\"localhost\", 8080);\nOutputStream socketOutputStream = socket.getOutputStream();\n\n// Initialize the output stream with the desired type\n// Here, we start with the ObjectOutputStream\noutputStream = new ObjectOutputStream(socketOutputStream);\n\n// Send a text command via the output stream\nString command = \"INFO\";\noutputStream.write(command.getBytes());\noutputStream.flush();\n\n// Switch to DataOutputStream and send an object\noutputStream = new DataOutputStream(socketOutputStream);\n\nString dataCommand = \"DATA\";\noutputStream.writeBytes(dataCommand);\noutputStream.flush();\n\n// Continue using the DataOutputStream or switch to other stream types as needed\n\n<<<explanation>>>: In the code above, we first create a common output stream variable named `outputStream`. We initialize it with the ObjectOutputStream and send a text command using the write method. Then, we switch to DataOutputStream by assigning it to the `outputStream` variable and send a data command using the writeBytes method. You can continue using the DataOutputStream or switch to other stream types based on your requirements. Note that you should ensure proper synchronization and handling of exceptions while switching between the stream types."
