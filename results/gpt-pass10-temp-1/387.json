By adding @Size(max = 20) to the activities field, Hibernate will ensure that the size of the list never exceeds 20. However, when you fetch the activities from the database, it will retrieve all the activities by default. To only fetch the most recent 5 activities, you will need to manually limit the collection in your Java code using subList or a similar method."
