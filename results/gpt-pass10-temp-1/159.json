Here's an example:\n\nOn the server side:\n1. Modify your SimpleServerApp code to keep track of the client sockets that are accepted:\n   ```java\n   List<Socket> clientSockets = new ArrayList<>();\n   ...\n   while (true) {\n       try {\n           Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();\n           clientSockets.add(clientSocket);\n           ...\n       }\n       ...\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. Add a new method in the SimpleServer class to close a client socket:\n   ```java\n   private void closeClientSocket(Socket clientSocket) {\n       try {\n           clientSocket.close();\n           clientSockets.remove(clientSocket);\n       } catch (IOException e) {\n           e.printStackTrace();\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. Use the closeClientSocket method to close a client socket whenever you want to reproduce the exception:\n   ```java\n   // Close a client socket at a specific index (for example, the first one)\n   if (!clientSockets.isEmpty()) {\n       closeClientSocket(clientSockets.get(0));\n   }\n   ```\n\nOn the client side:\n1. Modify your SimpleClientApp code to handle the SocketException and print the stack trace:\n   ```java\n   try {\n       socket = new Socket(\"localhost\", 3333);\n       ...\n   } catch (SocketException e) {\n       e.printStackTrace();\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. Uncomment the line \"//socket.close();\" to close the client socket abruptly:\n   ```java\n   //socket.close();\n   outWriter.println(\"Hello Mr. Server!\");\n   ```\n\nBy closing the client or server socket abruptly, you should be able to reproduce the \"java.net.SocketException.Connection reset\" exception."
