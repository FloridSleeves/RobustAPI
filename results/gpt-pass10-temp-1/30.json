However, here is an example code snippet that you can use to generate a random number between min and max, excluding some numbers within that range:\n\n<<<code>>>:\npublic static int getRandomNumber(int min, int max, int[] excludedNumbers) {\n    int randomNum;\n    boolean isExcluded;\n    \n    do {\n        randomNum = min + (int)(Math.random() * ((max - min) + 1));\n        isExcluded = false;\n        \n        for (int excluded : excludedNumbers) {\n            if (randomNum == excluded) {\n                isExcluded = true;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n    } while (isExcluded);\n\n    return randomNum;\n}\n\n<<<explanation>>>:\nIn this code snippet, the getRandomNumber method takes in the minimum and maximum values for the random number range, as well as an array of excluded numbers. It generates a random number between the min and max values using Math.random() and checks if the generated number is in the excludedNumbers array. If it is, the process is repeated until a valid number is generated. Once a valid number is generated, it is returned by the method. You can call this method in your activity's onCreate method to generate a random number and store it in a public variable."

I am confused how does it work? why doesn't it give error just like we get in java code? and most importantly, how does environment decide to which component it needs to invoke? I understand the process of id generation is automated, which gets added to R.java For instance, if we have same IDs, say \"image1\" in two XMLs, say \"layout1\" & \"layout2\". but in R.java it won't have 2 IDs. that means at a time it will reference only 1 component. In case we have to use 2 XMLs in an Activity, one as activity.setcontentview(layout1) and another as a PopupWindow.setContentView(layout2). What will happen in such case?\nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Activity.setContentView\n<<<code>>>: @Override\npublic void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n    Button myButton = (Button) findViewById(R.id.my_button);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You can findViewById of the current view hierarchy set to the activity.

I was able to do the random number using the math.rand() but I am trying to make sure that the three numbers do not match. I did a work around using while and if statements, but I was looking to see if there is a one line of command to do this, so that I can put it right under th activity class so that it's public var. and in that area (activity) I can't use while and if statements, I only can in onCreate due to the void or something. Thank you in advance for your help, and will vote for any help or idea that will lead to finding any info about this. \nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer:"
