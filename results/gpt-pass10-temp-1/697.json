However, the issue might be related to the fact that the temp file is created using createTempFile() which creates a file in the default temporary-file directory. This directory might not allow you to set the file as read-only or save the file to another location. You might need to specify a different directory for creating the temp file that allows read-only access."

In your code, you are calling this method on the temporary file created. However, it seems that this method is not working as expected. There can be multiple reasons for this. One possibility is that the file system you are working with does not support setting the read-only attribute. Another possibility is that your program does not have the necessary permissions to modify the file attributes. You can try using the java.nio.file package instead, specifically the Files.setAttribute() method, to set the read-only attribute of a file."

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1.
