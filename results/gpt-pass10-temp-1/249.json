It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time.

I need to use an HTTP server, but i don't need to use the TCP protocol (which is used right now via streams). I thought about a solution via ftp so i don't need to convert the file to a byte-array first. I assume that the problem lies exactly there. The server can't create the audio-file (midi-file) correctly from the byte-array. If anyone of you knows of a solution.
