                "content": "I apologize, but it seems that the provided API (File.createNewFile) is not relevant to your question about reloading a JSP with request.getAttribute values. The File.createNewFile API is used to create a new file in the file system, but it does not have any direct connection to JSP or request.getAttribute.\n\nTo address your question about reloading a JSP with request.getAttribute values, you can achieve this by redirecting the user back to the same JSP after processing the form submission. Here's a suggested approach:\n\n1. In your JSP, add a condition to check if the form has been submitted and process the form data accordingly. If the form has been submitted, handle the form data and update the text file.\n2. After processing the form data, set any necessary request attributes to be used in your JSP for displaying data.\n3. Use a redirect to reload the JSP. This will reload the page and clear any form data that was submitted. You can use JavaScript to automatically trigger the redirect after a successful form submission.\n\nHere's an example of how you can handle the submit button onClick event and reload the JSP while clearing the scanData textbox:\n\n1. Add an onClick event handler to the submit button in your JSP:\n```\n<html:submit onclick=\"submitForm(event);\" />\n```\n\n2. Add JavaScript code to handle the onClick event and trigger the redirect:\n```\n<script>\n  function submitForm(event) {\n    event.preventDefault();  // Prevent the default form submission\n\n    // Perform any necessary form data processing here, e.g. sending data to the server\n\n    // Redirect back to the same JSP\n    window.location.href = \"your-jsp-url\";\n  }\n</script>\n```\n\nBy using this approach, after the users click the submit button, the form data will be processed in the server-side action class (not related to File.createNewFile API), the necessary request attributes will be set, and then the page will be reloaded with the scanData textbox cleared, ready for the next user entry."

I chose Struts1 for this and i have been able to complete most of the functionalities.But the part of keeping on populating the text file on the basis of user entries in my JSP is something i am struggling with. The following are the flow of pages on user interface 1.'Accept user entries' http://www.image-share.com/ijpg-1178-104.html 2.'Ask for scan data on the basis of entries in page1' http://www.image-share.com/ijpg-1178-105.html 3.'Submit after entering the scandata. ' http://www.image-share.com/ijpg-1178-106.html (I have been able to straighten the null values in the images via session variables. Thanks to Dave) message is seen with null entries like this Post validation. My questions is:  What should be used so that there is a scenario that the users enter the Scan Data on page 2 and can continue to enter more scan data values by falling back on the same JSP . I was thinking on the lines of reloading the page using JavaScript on the button click. Is it the right approach? The relevant code for this is  <html:form action=\"txtwriter\">      <% String itemname = (String)session.getAttribute(\"itemname\");   %>  <% String lotnumber = (String)session.getAttribute(\"lotnumber\");   %> <% String godownname = (String)session.getAttribute(\"godownname\");  %>  <br/>   <% String message = (String)session.getAttribute(\"message\");     session.setAttribute( \"theFileName\", message );  %>    Filename : <%= message %>   <br/>  Item Name :<%= itemname %>  <br/> Lot Number :<%= lotnumber %>    <br/>    Godown Name :<%= godownname %>   <br/>    <bean:message key=\"label.scandata\"/>  <html:text property=\"scanData\" ></html:text>     <html:errors property=\"scanData\"/>  <br/>     <html:submit/>   /* How should the submit button handle the onClick event so that when the users click    after entering the text. 1. The entered text must be populated in the text file using a different action class.  (I have    this part working)   2.They must be on the same jsp with the scanData text box cleared waiting for the next  user      entry into that text  box so that this subsequest entry can also be entered into the text file.  Is there a way i can empty the 'scanData' textbox by accessing it by name inside my action so that i can empty it from my action class? (I am looking for this     answer)*/I used this inside the LoginAction.javaHttpSession session = request.getSession();   session.setAttribute(\"message\", textFile);   session.setAttribute(\"itemname\",loginForm.getItemName().trim());   session.setAttribute(\"lotnumber\",loginForm.getLotNumber().trim());    session.setAttribute(\"godownname\",loginForm.getStockGodown().trim());    \nPlease using this api: File.createNewFile.\nAnswer:"
