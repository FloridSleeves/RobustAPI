In your `copyFile` method, you are creating a new `PrintWriter` instance each time you want to append a line to the file. Instead of creating a new `PrintWriter` instance each time, you should create it once outside of the loop and pass it as a parameter to the `copyFile` method. You can modify your code as follows:\n\npublic static void copyFile(ArrayList<String> fileCon1, PrintWriter writer1) {\n    for(int i = 0 ; i < fileCon1.size() ; i++) {\n        writer1.println(fileCon1.get(i));\n    }\n    System.out.println(\"updated newrpms.txt\");\n}\n\nAnd then update your `splitStr` method to pass the `PrintWriter` as a parameter:\n\npublic static void splitStr(String str1, PrintWriter writer1) {\n    ArrayList<String> outputContent = new ArrayList<String>();\n    String[] split1 = str1.split(\" \");\n    for (int i = 0; i < split1.length; i++) {\n        if(fileExplode(split1[i])) {\n            System.out.println(split1[i]);\n            outputContent.add(split1[i]);\n        }\n    }\n    copyFile(outputContent, writer1);\n}\n\nFinally, update your `main` method to create the `PrintWriter` instance and pass it to the `splitStr` method:\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    URLget rpms = new URLget();\n    PrintWriter writer1 = null;\n    try {\n        writer1 = new PrintWriter(\"C:\\\\Users\\\\usersb\\\\Downloads\\\\rpms\\\\newrpms.txt\", \"UTF-8\");\n        getTdSibling(sendGetRequest(URL).toString(), writer1);\n    } catch (MalformedURLException e) {\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    } finally {\n        if (writer1 != null) {\n            writer1.close();\n        }\n    }\n}\n \nNow, when you execute the code, the file \"newrpms.txt\" should contain the same output as the `System.out.println(split1[i])` statements."
