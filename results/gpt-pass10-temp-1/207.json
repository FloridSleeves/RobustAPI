It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: How to execute \"an exe with return value\" in java?: :I created an executable using cpp which accepts two integer values and then returns the sum.
