Windows uses \"\\r\\n\" as the line separator, while other platforms typically use just \"\\n\".

The println method already appends a line separator at the end. So when you use output.println(\"something\\n\"), it actually adds an extra line separator. To fix this, you can use the write method instead and manually add the line separator using \"\\n\" or \"\\r\\n\" depending on your platform."

However, on Windows operating systems, the line break is represented by \"\\r\\n\" (carriage return + line feed), not just \"\\n\" (line feed) like on Unix-based systems. You need to use \"\\r\\n\" instead of just \"\\n\" to get the desired output."
