The server code listens for client connections on a specific port and accepts the connection when a client tries to connect. Once connected, the server creates input and output streams to communicate with the client. The server reads the client's request using `DataInputStream` and sends a response back using `DataOutputStream`. \n\nSimilarly, the client code establishes a connection with the server using the server's IP address and port number. It also creates input and output streams to communicate with the server. The client sends a request to the server using `DataOutputStream` and receives the response using `DataInputStream`.\n\nYou can modify and extend this code to fit your specific requirements, such as handling database queries and displaying data in the client's GUI."

The client side is represented by the Client class, which connects to the server using the Socket class. Again, you can perform any necessary operations with the server using the socket's input and output streams. Remember to close the connections once you are done."

Once we accept a client connection, we create a new thread to handle the client request separately. Inside the ClientHandler class, we read the input from the client, process it, prepare a response, and send it back to the client.\n\nIn the client code, we create a Socket object and connect to the server using the server's IP address and port number. We then send a request to the server and read the response from the server.\n\nYou can modify the server code to handle specific requests from the client and perform database operations accordingly. The client code can be modified to send different requests to the server.\n\nNote: This code is a basic example and does not include error handling and other advanced features."

The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: make a client server java application: :I am trying to make a Java application in a client/server way.The client is a GUI in SWT which displays data from the server. The server is connected to a database.Ok, sorry for that, it's a classic question I'm sure, but I don't know how to start.In a project I worked for they implemented a lot of magic with Proxy.newProxyInstance() to invoke the Glassfish server transparently.I don't want to use a Glassfish server. I just want something simple in plain Java. But the concept of proxies seems pretty cool.Do you have ideas or examples of such thing? How do I write the server part to handle the requests of clients?Thanks in advanceFluminis\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
