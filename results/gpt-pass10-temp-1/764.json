That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1.

But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: incorrect data input in file from an OutputStream( Java ): :I wrote a data to text file, but data in file are incorrect.
