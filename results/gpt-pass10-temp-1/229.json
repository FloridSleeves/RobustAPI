The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: How to get Entity at the servlet using MultipartEntity?: :If i Upload a file to my servlet like this:HttpClient httpclient = new DefaultHttpClient();HttpPost httppost = new HttpPost(\"http://www.tumblr.com/api/write\");try {    MultipartEntity entity = new MultipartEntity();    entity.addPart(\"type\", new StringBody(\"photo\"));    entity.addPart(\"data\", new FileBody(image));    httppost.setEntity(entity);    HttpResponse response = httpclient.execute(httppost);} catch (ClientProtocolException e) {} catch (IOException e) {}How can I retrieve the content at the servlet?protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws  IOException {     request.???}I'm using Google App Server as my Servlet API\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
