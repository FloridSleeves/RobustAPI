To avoid this, you can pass a ByteBuffer instead of a String to the threads. ByteBuffer is a more efficient way to handle large amounts of data. The createByteBuffer function converts the string to a byte array and creates a direct ByteBuffer from it. The ByteBuffer is then duplicated for each thread to ensure thread-safety. Each thread operates on its own buffer, writing it to the file using FileChannel.write. Remember to close the file, RandomAccessFile, and FileChannel in the finally block to prevent resource leaks. Additionally, the wipe() method calls System.gc() and System.runFinalization() to encourage garbage collection and reclaim memory."

To avoid this, you can create a byte array once and pass it to each thread. The byte array can then be wrapped in a ByteBuffer, which can be passed to the FileChannel.write() method. By using a byte array instead of a String, you can reduce memory usage and prevent OutOfMemoryError."

I wrote objects at various locations in the file. The objects were of variable sizes but all of the same class.Now I want to read from such a file. I dont want to have to specify the number of bytes to read. I want to be able to read the object directly using Object Input Stream. How to achieve this ? I have to use Random Access Files because I need to write to different positions in file. I am also recording in a separate data structure, the locations where objects have been written.\nPlease using this api: FileChannel.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: FileChannel.write\n<<<code>>>: while(rbb.hasRemaining()) {\n        try{\n            fileChannel.writeLong(recordBytes.length);\n            fileChannel.write(rbb);\n        } catch {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");}\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: The simplest solution that comes to mind is to write out the length of the array before writing out the array itself. When reading the object, you first read the length. This'll tell you how many further bytes to read to get your object. Similarly to what you are already doing on the writing side, you could read the data into a byte[] and then use ByteArrayInputputStream and ObjectInputStream.\nQuestion: OutOfMemory Exception when multithreading ... heap space?: :I am working on an application that needs to be compatible with Android 2.3 (Gingerbread), and the device I'm using for development tests is a Motorola Atrix MB860 running Android 2.3.6.In this device I get roughly 40MB of maximum heap space and as far as I could realize, my app uses around 33MB, but I get an OutOfMemoryError exception anyway.Basically, the part of my code that matters to this issue creates a large String (8MB - I know it's rather big, but if it's too small it won't satisfy one of the requirements) and then goes on to create 2 threads that use such string to write to a certain memory space concurrently.Here is the code:    // Create random string    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();    sb.ensureCapacity(8388608); // ensuring 8 MB is allocated on the heap for the StringBuilder object    for (long i = 0; i < DATA_SIZE; i++) {            char c = chars[new Random().nextInt(chars.length)];            sb.append(c);    }    String randomByteString = sb.toString();    ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);    for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {        Runnable worker = new SlidingBubbles(param1, param2, randomByteString)        executor.execute(worker);    }    // This will make the executor accept no new threads     // and finish all existing threads in the queue     executor.shutdown();    // Wait until all threads are finish     while(!executor.isTerminated()) {        // wait for bubble threads to finish working...    }and the threads' routine:private class SlidingBubbles implements Runnable {    private int param1, param2;    private String randomByteString;    private final Object mSignal = new Object();    private volatile long tempBytesWritten = 0;    private volatile long totalBytesWritten = 0;    public SlidingBubbles(int param1, int param2, String randomByteString) {        this.param1= param1;        this.param2= param2;        this.randomByteString = randomByteString;    }    private void doIt() {        File file = null;        RandomAccessFile randomAccessFile = null;        FileChannel fc = null;        try {            while(param1> 0) {                // Instantiate the 1st bubble file                file = new File(TARGET_DIR, String.valueOf(Calendar.getInstance().getTimeInMillis()));                while(param2 > 0) {                                            randomAccessFile = new RandomAccessFile(file, \"rwd\");                    fc = randomAccessFile.getChannel();                    fc.position(fc.size());                    synchronized (mSignal) {                        tempBytesWritten = fc.write(ByteBuffer.wrap(randomByteString.getBytes()));                        totalBytesWritten += tempBytesWritten;                    }       // some other things that don't matter    }    @Override    public void run() {        wipe();                }}Awkwardly (to me), on the 30th line of the thread routine (tempBytesWritten = fc.write(ByteBuffer.wrap(randomByteString.getBytes()));), the 2nd thread (\"pool-1-thread-2\") launches the exception, exits, and the 1st thread (\"pool-1-thread-1\") continues (actually, starts) executing normally.By the time the JVM is done allocating space for that large String, the app is using 33MB of the heap. As you can see from the code, thatString is created only once, but then used multiple times from both threads.Shouldn't the threads be using just a reference to the String rather than copying it? (which would, in this case, exceed the 40MB allowance).I must also point out that it is (or at least seems to be, as far as my understanding goes) impossible to increase this heap space on Gingerbread (previous research).Is there anything I'm missing?Any help is greatly appreciated.\nPlease using this api: FileChannel.write.\nAnswer:"
