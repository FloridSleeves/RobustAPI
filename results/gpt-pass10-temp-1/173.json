This can cause performance issues when dealing with large amounts of data. Instead, you can use a `StringBuilder` to efficiently append the lines and then convert it to a `String` using `toString()` method. This will help improve the performance and prevent any issues with the response not being displayed or the code not moving ahead."

That's why the loop appears to stop executing after the first iteration. By using a `StringBuilder` to accumulate the lines and assigning it back to `ret`, you ensure that all the lines are concatenated correctly.

In Java, strings are immutable, which means that any operation that modifies a string actually creates a new string object. So, when you use 'ret.concat(line)', it creates a new string object but you are not assigning it back to 'ret'. This causes 'ret' to still refer to the old string object, which never gets updated. To fix this, assign the result of concatenation back to 'ret' like 'ret = ret.concat(line)'."

The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Try/catch block with a while statement, used to handle socket data, does not continue.
