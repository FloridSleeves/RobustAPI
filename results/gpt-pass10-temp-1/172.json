                "content": "Sorry, I don't have the capability to execute code. However, I can provide an explanation and guide you on how to approach the problem.\n\nTo access the current line content while parsing an XML file using SAX parser, you can use the Locator interface provided by the SAX API. The Locator interface provides methods to retrieve the line number and column number of the currently parsed XML element.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use the Locator interface to get the line content:\n\n1. Implement the ContentHandler interface and override the startElement() method:\n\n    ```java\n    public class MyContentHandler implements ContentHandler {\n        \n        private Locator locator; // reference to the locator\n        \n        // ...\n\n        @Override\n        public void setLocator(Locator locator) {\n            this.locator = locator;\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public void startElement(String uri, String localName, String qName, Attributes attributes) throws SAXException {\n            int lineNumber = locator.getLineNumber();\n            // Use the lineNumber to read the corresponding line from the file\n            // ...\n        }\n        \n        // ...\n    }\n    ```\n\n2. Create a new instance of XMLReader and set the ContentHandler:\n\n    ```java\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\n        SAXParserFactory factory = SAXParserFactory.newInstance();\n        SAXParser saxParser = factory.newSAXParser();\n        \n        XMLReader xmlReader = saxParser.getXMLReader();\n        MyContentHandler contentHandler = new MyContentHandler();\n        xmlReader.setContentHandler(contentHandler);\n        \n        // Parse the XML file\n        xmlReader.parse(new InputSource(new FileInputStream(\"your-xml-file.xml\")));\n    }\n    ```\n\nIn the startElement() method, you can use the `lineNumber` obtained from `locator.getLineNumber()` to read the corresponding line from the file. Note that you would need to handle reading the file separately in this approach.\n\nRegarding your second question about including doctype declarations, you can use the `startDTD()` and `endDTD()` methods provided by the DTDHandler interface. These methods will be called by the SAX parser when it encounters a DTD declaration in the XML file. You can use the `Locator` interface to get the current line and column information from these methods as well.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any additional questions."

It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block.

And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Java SAX parsing.
