It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Using JMeter TCP Sampler is it possible to determine message length using first bytes of the response: :I need some help on identifying the length of the response using the the first byte(s) of the message.
