When running the program from Eclipse, it inherits the UTF-8 encoding from Eclipse's settings. However, when running the executable jar file, it uses the default encoding of your operating system. To force the program to use UTF-8 encoding even when running from the jar file, you can specify the encoding as a command line argument using the -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 option."

By default, the Java VM uses the default character encoding of the operating system. In your case, it seems that the default encoding is UTF-8, which is why the output file is encoded correctly when running through Eclipse.\nHowever, when you create a JAR file and run it outside of Eclipse, it may use a different default encoding. To ensure that the output file is always encoded in UTF-8, you can specify the encoding explicitly in your source code when creating the output stream.\nIn your example, you are using a BufferedWriter to write to the output file. You have correctly specified UTF-8 encoding in the constructor. However, if the output is still not encoded correctly, there may be other factors at play, such as the encoding settings of the operating system or the program that is used to view the output file."
