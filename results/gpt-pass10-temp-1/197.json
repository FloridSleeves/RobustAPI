It supports SSH2 protocol suite and provides various functionalities such as session management, file transfer, and port forwarding. You can find examples and documentation on their website.\n\n2. SSHJ:\nSSHJ is a Java SSH library inspired by JSch. It aims to provide a simpler and more intuitive API for SSH communication. You can find examples and documentation on their GitHub page.\n\n3. Apache MINA SSHD:\nApache MINA SSHD is a Java implementation of the SSH protocols that provides server and client-side support. It offers various features such as multi-threading, NIO-based architecture, and support for multiple authentication methods. You can find examples and documentation on their website.\n\nPlease note that these libraries have different features and capabilities, so you should choose the one that best fits your requirements.\n\n<<<explanation>>>: When working with SSH in Java, it is recommended to use existing libraries instead of trying to implement the protocol yourself. These libraries provide a higher-level API and handle the complexities of SSH communication. The examples and documentation provided by each library will help you understand how to establish a connection and perform tasks such as running commands or transferring files over SSH."

It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time.
