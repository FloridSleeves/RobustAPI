That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1.

But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Java next line print.writer: :I have a little problem with saving files list to file:class listFilesForFolder{    static String fs1= System.getProperty(\"user.dir\" )+\"/lista plik\u00f3w\";    static File fs2= new File(fs1);    public static void listFilesForFolder(File folder) throws FileNotFoundException  {        for ( File fileEntry : folder.listFiles()) {               if (fileEntry.isDirectory()) {                listFilesForFolder(fileEntry);            }            System.out.println(fileEntry.getName());            zapis(fileEntry.getName());         }    }    static void zapis(String plik)throws FileNotFoundException {        PrintWriter zapis = new PrintWriter(fs2);        zapis.println(plik+ \"\\r\\n\");        zapis.close();    }}This code print all files list on the screen but my file \"lista plik\u00f3w\" have only one name of file (should have more).
