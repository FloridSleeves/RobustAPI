The split() method splits a string into an array of substrings based on a specified delimiter. In this case, I have used a comma as the delimiter.\n\nFirst, I read the first line of the file to get the products and store them in an array. Then, I loop through the rest of the lines, splitting each line into an array of ratings. I iterate through the products array and print the corresponding product and rating for each iteration.\n\nThis approach is simpler and more intuitive than using StringTokenizer, especially for beginners."

Then, for the first line, which contains the products separated by commas, you can use `StringTokenizer` to extract the individual products. For the subsequent lines, you can use another `StringTokenizer` to extract the ratings for each product.\n\nI have modified your code accordingly. It reads the products from the first line and prints them, and then it reads the ratings for each product from the subsequent lines and prints them as well. The number of products and ratings per product is assumed to be 4 in this example.\n\nNote that I have removed the unnecessary `do-while` loop and fixed some syntax errors in your original code."

You should use BufferedReader to read the CSV file line by line. Then, you can use StringTokenizer to split each line into tokens based on the specified delimiter. In this example, I have used BufferedReader to read the file and StringTokenizer to split each line into tokens. The first 4 tokens are considered as products, and the rest of the tokens are considered as ratings. Note that you need to provide the correct path to your CSV file in the csvFile variable."

If I were to use a couple of Arrays I could have done it a while ago but having to use the StringTokenizer is driving me nuts. The main problem I am having is reading the CSV file. I don't know how to do it and previous searches online have only brought forward super intense solutions that are too much for a beginner like me to handle. This is my code. As you can see, I don't know whether use .nextLine() or .NextToken(). Neither seems to work.For those wondering the assignment is basically reading the first 4 products separated by commas and reading the rest of the rows as the rating of those 4 products. Basically 6 rows with 4 columns. The first row is the products the rest are the ratings.import java.util.StringTokenizer;import java.io.FileInputStream;import java.io.FileNotFoundException;import java.util.Scanner;public class ProductRating {public static void main(String[] args) {    // TODO Auto-generated method stub    Scanner fileIn=null;    try{        fileIn = new Scanner(                 new FileInputStream(\"C:/Users/Cristian/Desktop\"));    }    catch (FileNotFoundException e)     {  // This block executed if the file is not found        // and then the program exits    System.out.println(\"File not found.\");    System.exit(0);    }    //If Opened File Successful this runs    String products = \"A\";    String rantings =\"0\";    System.out.println(\"Gathering Ratings for Products\");    do{        String delimiters = \", \";        StringTokenizer gatherProducts[]=new StringTokenizer[inputLine, delimeters];        gatherProducts=fileIn.nextLine();    }while(fileIn.hasNextLine()==true);}   }\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:"
