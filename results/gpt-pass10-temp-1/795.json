Instead, you should create a FileOutputStream with the append parameter set to true and pass it to the PrintWriter constructor. This way, the PrintWriter will append the data to the existing file if it exists, or create a new file if it doesn't."

If the file doesn't exists, I want to create the file and then add the data.Adding data works fine. But appending data overwrites existing data. I followed the instructions of axtavt here (PrintWriter append method not appending).     String savestr = \"mysave.sav\";     File f = new File(savestr);    PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(savestr);    if ( f.exists() && !f.isDirectory() ) {        out = new PrintWriter(new FileOutputStream(new File(savestr), true));        out.append(mapstring);        out.close();    }    else {        out.println(mapstring);        out.close();    }where mapstring is the string I want to append.
