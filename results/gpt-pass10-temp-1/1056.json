It is used to separate multiple options. To use it as a literal character, you need to escape it with a double backslash '\\\\'. So, in your case, you can use temp.split(\"\\\\|\") to split the string based on the pipe character '|'.\n\nThe code provided above splits the string \"0|0\" into two parts: \"0\" and \"0\". The splitString array will have these two values at index positions 0 and 1, respectively."

This will split the string correctly at the '|' character and give you the desired output."
