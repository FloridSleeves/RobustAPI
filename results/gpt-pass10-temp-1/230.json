In the case of a POST request, the request headers will be followed by the request body, and if the server does not properly read the headers or doesn't handle the content length correctly, it can cause the buffered reader to hang. \n\nMake sure you are correctly parsing and consuming the request headers (such as Content-Type and Content-Length) before reading the request body. You can use the BufferedReader's `readLine()` method to read the headers, and then parse the headers to determine the size of the request body. Once you have the content length, you can use `read()` or `readLine()` to read the request body.\n\nIf the problem persists, it would be helpful to see the code you are using to handle the POST requests, as well as any error messages or stack traces you are receiving."

If the POST request does not include these characters, the readLine() method will hang waiting for them.\n\nTo fix this, you can use a loop to read each line of the request until you reach the end of the input stream (line == null). Concatenate each line to a String variable (rawData in this example) for further processing. Finally, remember to close the BufferedReader to release resources.\n\nAdditionally, make sure that you are reading the request properly according to the HTTP protocol specifications. You might need to handle headers, content length, and other elements depending on your server requirements."

The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Buffered Reader HTTP POST: :Looking for a bit of help, I have currently written a HTTP server. It currently handles GET requests fine. However, whilst using POST the buffered reader seems to hang. When the request is stopped the rest of the input stream is read via the buffered reader. I have found a few things on google. I have tried changing the CRLF and the protocol version from 1.1 to 1.0 (browsers automatically make requests as 1.1) Any ideas or help would be appreciated.
