If you want to include empty fields, you can use a custom implementation of StringTokenizer that handles this case.\n\nHere is an example of a custom implementation that includes empty fields:\n\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.List;\n\npublic class CustomStringTokenizer {\n    private String input;\n    private String delimiter;\n    private int currentPosition;\n\n    public CustomStringTokenizer(String input, String delimiter) {\n        this.input = input;\n        this.delimiter = delimiter;\n        this.currentPosition = 0;\n    }\n\n    public boolean hasMoreTokens() {\n        return currentPosition < input.length();\n    }\n\n    public String nextToken() {\n        StringBuilder token = new StringBuilder();\n\n        while (currentPosition < input.length()) {\n            if (input.startsWith(delimiter, currentPosition)) {\n                currentPosition += delimiter.length();\n                return token.toString();\n            } else {\n                token.append(input.charAt(currentPosition));\n                currentPosition++;\n            }\n        }\n\n        return token.toString();\n    }\n}\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    String input = \"one\\t\\ttwo\\t\\t\\tthree\";\n    CustomStringTokenizer st = new CustomStringTokenizer(input, \"\\t\");\n    List<String> tokens = new ArrayList<>();\n\n    while (st.hasMoreTokens()) {\n        String token = st.nextToken();\n        tokens.add(token);\n    }\n\n    for (String token : tokens) {\n        System.out.println(\"Token: \" + token);\n    }\n}\nIn this custom implementation, the nextToken() method checks if the delimiter is present at the current position in the input string. If it is, it moves the currentPosition past the delimiter and returns the accumulated token. Otherwise, it appends the current character to the token and moves the currentPosition forward.\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The custom implementation of StringTokenizer provided here checks for each character whether the delimiter is present and handles the case of consecutive delimiters correctly. It accumulates the characters until a delimiter is found or the end of the input string is reached.\n\nYou can use this custom implementation in the same way as the standard StringTokenizer. The tokens can be stored in a list or processed immediately."

However, I can provide some general suggestions for optimizing your code to solve the Uva's 3n+1 problem:\n\n1. Use dynamic programming: Instead of recomputing values for the same numbers multiple times, store the already computed values in an array. This can significantly improve the performance of your program.\n\n2. Optimize the loop: Instead of iterating over all numbers from lowerBound to upperBound, you can optimize the loop by skipping numbers that are already in the recentlyused array. This can save computation time.\n\n3. Use long instead of int: The problem statement mentions that the input can be as large as 1,000,000. It's better to use the long data type instead of int to handle larger numbers.\n\n4. Split computation into functions: Split your code into smaller functions to improve readability and maintainability. For example, you can have separate functions for calculating the cycle length and updating the recentlyused array.\n\n5. Consider using a more efficient algorithm: The 3n+1 problem has been extensively studied, and there are more efficient algorithms available (e.g., Collatz conjecture). You might want to explore those algorithms for better performance.\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The code provided is a general optimization suggestion for the Uva's 3n+1 problem. It focuses on improving the performance by using dynamic programming and optimizing the loop. It also suggests using the long data type instead of int for larger numbers.
