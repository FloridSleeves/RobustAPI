Make sure you have the correct version of Java installed on your machine.\n2. In Eclipse, go to Window > Preferences > Java > Installed JREs and ensure that the correct JRE is selected.\n3. Right-click on your project in the Package Explorer, go to Properties > Java Build Path, and check the JRE System Library version.\n4. If the JRE System Library version is incorrect, you can edit it by clicking on the \"Edit\" button and selecting the correct JRE version.\n5. Clean and rebuild your project to ensure the changes take effect.\n\nIf the issue still persists, you might need to check your project configuration or consult with your IDE's documentation for further troubleshooting steps."
