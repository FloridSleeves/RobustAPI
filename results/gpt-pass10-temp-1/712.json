That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Is there any way to make a JSP print carriage returns (CR)?: :I'm currently generating some vCards using JSP. I found out some platforms don't recognize these generated vCards unless their lines are separated by Carriage Returns (CR), and JSP seems to use just Line Feed (LF) by default to separate lines.Do you guys know any way to tell the JSP to include a CR between each line?I hope someone has a clue, cause I haven't found much out there...Thanks in advance!\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
