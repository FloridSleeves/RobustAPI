But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Appending .txt file is erasing everything: :import java.io.FileWriter;import java.io.PrintWriter;public class DemoPrint {    public static void main (String args []) {        try{            PrintWriter coolFile = new PrintWriter(\"c:\\\\JavaIO\\\\cool.txt\");            FileWriter file = new FileWriter(\"c:\\\\JavaIO\\\\cool.txt\", true);            coolFile.println(\"Why isn't this adding another line?\");            coolFile.close();        }        catch (Exception e) {            System.out.println(\"Error\");        }}    }So I'm new to programming/java and I'm trying to open this file and append the data and add another line but for some reason the data is just being erased and overwritten with whatever I have in the coolFile.println(\"\").Can anyone help me out on this? I know its probably a easy fix... I'm learning.. Thank you!\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
