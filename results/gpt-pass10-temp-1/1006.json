The getBytes() method returns the bytes of the string encoded in the specified character set. In the example above, the string is encoded using the UTF-8 character set. However, it's worth noting that the getBytes() method can throw an exception, so it's important to handle any potential exceptions that may occur."

However, when printing the value of Request at the end of the loop, you are not seeing the desired result because you are not properly handling the end of the input from the client. You are using the `readLine()` method to read lines from the client's input, which will return null only when the client's input is closed. In your case, the client is not closing its output stream, so the loop never ends and the code continues to wait for more input, resulting in an empty Request. You need to handle the termination condition properly, e.g., by checking if `tmp` is null or empty before appending it to the Request."
