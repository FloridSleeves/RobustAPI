It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block.

And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Issue with a Process Object of Java: :I have a problem with a Process Object of Java.I want to open the process called linphonec.exe to make calls, and inside this process I have to insert a few command lines to do calls, answer ...The problem comes when I have to insert more than one command line because the OutputStream of Process only accepts a command line when I call the close() method of OutputStream. If I dont call this method the command line isn't executed.I want to execute more than one command but I can't.Example:\"Call phone\" and then \"terminate\" to end the call whenever I want. But I can only insert the first command line and if I dont use the close() method the command line is not executed.Code:Start a process:ProcessBuilder builder = new ProcessBuilder(PROCESS);builder.redirectErrorStream(true);Process p = builder.start();Read the InputStream of Process:InputStream i = p.getInputStream();System.out.print((char)i.read());while(i.available() > 0){    System.out.print((char)i.read());}Insert command line into OutputStream:String command = com.nextLine();OutputStream o = p.getOutputStream();o.write(comando.getBytes());o.flush();o.close();If I delete \"o.close()\" the command line is not executed, but if I execute it I can't execute the other command lines.I tried the code on my program, but when I insert the command line I dont see the next information of the process.When I put your code :ReadyWarning: video is disabled in linphonec, use -V or -C or -D to enable.linphonec> Registration on sip:XX.XX.XX.XX successful.linphonec> call XXXExemple with my code:ReadyWarning: video is disabled in linphonec, use -V or -C or -D to enable.linphonec> Registration on sip:XX.XX.XX.XX successful.linphonec> call XXXEstablishing call id to sip:XXX@XX.XX.XX.XX, assigned id 1With \"Available > 0\" I get \"Establishing call id to sip:XXX@XX.XX.XX.XX, assigned id 1\".If I use this loop I dont see the other info of the process.I think the problem is that the outputstream does not get the command lines until I execute the Close method.Thank you.Sorry for my bad englando.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
