Instead, the Scanner class is used to read and parse the lines of the input file. The solution code modifies the provided code to correctly use StringTokenizer to tokenize each line and retrieve the desired words. The code reads the first token from each line as the number of words to skip and then uses a for loop to skip those words. It then retrieves the next word using StringTokenizer.nextToken() and appends it to the output string \"c\"."
