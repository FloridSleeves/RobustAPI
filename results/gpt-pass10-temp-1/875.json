The moveToFirst() method moves the cursor to the first row, so when you call moveToNext() in the while loop, it skips the first row and starts iterating from the second row. To fix this, you can move the moveToFirst() statement outside the while loop, like this:\n\n```\npublic void loadTrack() {\n    SQLiteDatabase db1 = waypoints.getWritableDatabase();\n    Cursor trackCursor = db1.query(TABLE_NAME, FROM, \"trackidfk=1\", null, null, null,ORDER_BY);\n    if (trackCursor.moveToFirst()) {\n        do {\n            Double lat = trackCursor.getDouble(2);\n            Double lon = trackCursor.getDouble(1);\n            System.out.println(lon);\n            System.out.println(lat);\n        } while (trackCursor.moveToNext());\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWith this change, the first set of longitude and latitude values will also be included in the iteration."
