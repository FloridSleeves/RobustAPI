In this way, you call the getBytes() method directly on the String object, which returns the byte array representation of the string using the platform's default character encoding.\n\nThe second way, which is the incorrect way you mentioned, tries to call the getBytes() method on the String class itself instead of an instance of the String. This is why it does not work and gives a compilation error. The getBytes() method is an instance method, so it can only be called on an instance of the String class.\n\nTherefore, to convert a Java String into a byte array, use the first way shown in the code example above by calling the getBytes() method directly on the String object. Additionally, you can specify the character encoding by passing it as an argument to the getBytes() method, as shown in the second example using StandardCharsets.UTF_8."

However, getBytes() is not a static method, so it cannot be invoked on the class itself. Instead, it needs to be called on a specific instance of the String class, like in the first example.\n\nTo fix the second way, you need to call the getBytes() method on the \"word\" object, just like in the first example. Additionally, you can provide a character set as an argument to specify the character encoding to be used for conversion, as shown in the corrected code.\n\nThe output of the code will be two byte arrays representing the string \"coding\", one using the platform's default charset and the other using UTF-8."

However, the getBytes() method is an instance method, which means it needs to be called on a specific instance of the String class. \n\nIn the first way, you are correctly calling the getBytes() method on the specific instance \"word\" by using the dot notation. This converts the \"word\" string into a byte array.\n\nIn the second way, you are trying to call the getBytes() method directly on the String class, without specifying a specific instance.

This can lead to unexpected behavior if your string contains characters that are not supported by the default encoding.\n\nIn the second way, when you call \"String.getBytes(word)\", you are passing the character encoding as a parameter to the getBytes method.
