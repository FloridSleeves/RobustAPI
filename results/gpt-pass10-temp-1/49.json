The provided code and explanation are related to loading application icons from package names in Android, but your question is about displaying JTree node names correctly in Java.\n\nTo address your actual question, it seems that the issue might be related to the custom cell renderer you are using for the JTree. Without seeing the complete code and how the tree is populated, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of the issue.\n\nHowever, one possible solution for displaying the full node names is to override the `toString()` method in your custom tree node class (`XMLDialogTreeNode`) and return the full name instead of the default `toString()` implementation.\n\nFor example:\n\n```java\npublic class XMLDialogTreeNode extends DefaultMutableTreeNode {\n    private String nodeName;\n\n    // Constructor\n    public XMLDialogTreeNode(String nodeName) {\n        this.nodeName = nodeName;\n    }\n\n    // Override toString() to return the full name\n    @Override\n    public String toString() {\n        return nodeName;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBy overriding `toString()` and returning the `nodeName` in your custom `XMLDialogTreeNode` class, the JTree will use the full name instead of the default `toString()` representation.\n\nKeep in mind that this solution assumes that the `nodeName` field in your `XMLDialogTreeNode` class contains the correct full name of the node. Ensure that the `nodeName` is correctly set when creating instances of `XMLDialogTreeNode`."

The provided code and API (ApplicationInfo.loadIcon) are related to Android development, specifically retrieving the icon and label of an application installed on an Android device. However, your question is about displaying names in a JTree in Java Swing.\n\nTo display the full name of JTree nodes, you need to check if the text of the node is getting truncated. This truncation might occur due to various reasons such as limited space or a custom cell renderer setting a fixed width for the node label.\n\nTo troubleshoot and fix the issue, you can try the following steps:\n\n1. Check if the JTree's cell renderer is setting the maximum width for the node label. In your code, you have a custom cell renderer called XMLDialogTreeCellRenderer. Look for any code related to setting the preferred/maximum width for the label and modify it accordingly.\n\n2. Ensure that the JTree is using the custom cell renderer you've implemented. You can call `setCellRenderer` on the JTree instance and pass an instance of your XMLDialogTreeCellRenderer.\n\n3. If the issue persists, check if the JTree's parent component (e.g., JScrollPane) has any layout constraints or settings that might cause the truncation. Make sure it has enough space to display the full node names.\n\n4. If none of the above steps solve the problem, examine the XML data being used to construct the JTree. Verify if the full names are present in the XML and are correctly assigned to the JTree nodes.\n\nSince your provided code does not directly call the ApplicationInfo.loadIcon API, I cannot provide a detailed answer using that specific API. However, you can adapt the given steps to your JTree issue to resolve the truncation problem."

However for some reason some node's userData Strings are not being fully displayed, rather thay are cut short or cut off completely with ... appended to the end of the name.The affected Nodes appear to be random, and are different each time the tree is refreshed or recreated from the XML.Things I've ruled out:Not enough space to display the full name. The JTree is inside a JScrollPane with plenty of horizontal space, the JScrollPane isn't even showing a horizontal scroll bar to indicate a lack of space.Even the shortest name can be affected.The cut off point isn't consistent for all shortened node names.Incomplete name loaded from XMLIf the affected node isn't a leaf and is then expanded or collapsed, the full name is displayed properly when it is re-rendered, the XML isn't consulted at all during this process.EDIT:As requested some explanation of the code behind the JTree:The creation of the TreeModel and the population of the tree:public XMLDialogTree(Document doc)    {        DefaultTreeModel treeModel = new DefaultTreeModel(buildTreeNode(doc.getElementsByTagName(\"Dialogs\").item(0)));        setModel(treeModel);    }// A recursive function to build the treeprivate DefaultMutableTreeNode buildTreeNode(Node xmlNode)    {        // Make sure the node's name is a description of what it is, as opposed to a generic XML tag        XMLDialogTreeNode = new XMLDialogTreeNode(xmlNode.getAttributes().getNamedItem(\"name\").getNodeValue());        treeNode.controlName = xmlNode.getNodeName();        // Add children to the treeNode based on the xmlNode's children        NodeList nodeList = xmlNode.getChildNodes();        for (int i = 0; i < nodeList.getLength(); i++)            {                Node tempNode = nodeList.item(i);                if (tempNode.getNodeType() == Node.ELEMENT_NODE)                    {                        // loop again if has child nodes                        treeNode.add(buildTreeNode(tempNode));                    }            }        return treeNode;    }Where doc is an org.w3c.dom.Document containing parsed XML and an XMLDialogTreeNode is literally just a javax.swing.tree.DefaultMutableTreeNode extended to contain String controlName = \"CustomNodeName\"The custom CellRenderer is as follows, The code is pretty much all to do with loading custom icons, nothing that should affect the Displayed name.public class XMLDialogTreeCellRenderer extends DefaultTreeCellRenderer{    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;    // Icons used in the JTree, loaded once on an as needed basis once, and stored here.    private static final Map<String, Icon> icons = new HashMap<String, Icon>();    static        {            // Make sure the default icon is loaded            loadIcon(\"_not_found\");        }    @Override    public Component getTreeCellRendererComponent(JTree tree, Object value, boolean sel, boolean exp, boolean leaf, int row, boolean hasFocus)        {            XMLDialogTreeNode node = (XMLDialogTreeNode) value;            setIcons(node.controlName);            super.getTreeCellRendererComponent(tree, value, sel, exp, false/* leaf */, row, hasFocus);            return this;        }    /**     * Assigns both the open and close icons, which are specific to a certain control.
