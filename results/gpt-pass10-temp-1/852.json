By moving the audio output to a separate thread, it can run concurrently with your game logic, reducing any potential latency or stalls.\nYou can create a new thread and start it to handle the audio output. Here's an example of how you could implement it:\n\n```java\npublic class AudioThread extends Thread {\n   private String audioFilePath;\n\n   public AudioThread(String audioFilePath) {\n      this.audioFilePath = audioFilePath;\n   }\n\n   public void run() {\n      try {\n         // Open the audio file\n         File audioFile = new File(audioFilePath);\n         AudioInputStream audioStream = AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream(audioFile);\n\n         // Create a line to play the audio\n         SourceDataLine line = (SourceDataLine) AudioSystem.getLine(new DataLine.Info(SourceDataLine.class, audioStream.getFormat()));\n         line.open(audioStream.getFormat());\n         line.start();\n\n         // Read audio data from the input stream and write it to the line\n         byte[] buffer = new byte[4096];\n         int bytesRead;\n         while ((bytesRead = audioStream.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n            line.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);\n         }\n\n         // Clean up resources\n         audioStream.close();\n         line.drain();\n         line.close();\n      } catch (IOException | UnsupportedAudioFileException | LineUnavailableException e) {\n         e.printStackTrace();\n      }\n   }\n}\n\n// Usage example\nAudioThread audioThread = new AudioThread(\"path/to/audio.wav\");\naudioThread.start();\n```\n\nNote: In this example, I assume you are using the Java Sound API for audio playback. The audio file path is passed to the `AudioThread` constructor, and the thread opens the audio file, reads the data, and plays it using a `SourceDataLine`.\nStarting the audio playback in a separate thread can help reduce the stall during output."

By offloading the audio playback to a separate thread, the main game thread can continue running without waiting for the audio output to complete.

Whenever you need to play the audio, you can call the playAudio() method inside your AudioThread class.\n\nBy using a separate thread for audio playback, you can avoid the stall in your main game thread and achieve faster audio output.
