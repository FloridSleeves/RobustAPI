This way, you don't get an exception because you're not modifying the list while iterating.\n\nIn the second example, when you remove an element from the list using an iterator or a for-each loop, it internally checks for any modifications made to the list.

This behavior is allowed because the index-based removal does not interfere with the iteration process.\n\nIn the second code snippet, when you use a for-each loop and try to remove elements from the list using arr.remove(myString), it results in a ConcurrentModificationException because the underlying iterator of the for-each loop detects that the list has been structurally modified during the iteration. The iterator is designed to prevent modifications to the collection that it is iterating over to avoid potential issues with concurrent modification.\n\nTo avoid the exception and safely remove elements from the list while iterating, you should use the iterator.remove() method, which is specifically designed for this purpose. Here's an example:\n\nIterator<String> iterator = arr.iterator();\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\n  String myString = iterator.next();\n  if (/* condition to remove element */) {\n    iterator.remove();\n  }\n}\n\nThis allows you to safely remove elements from the list while iterating without causing a ConcurrentModificationException."
