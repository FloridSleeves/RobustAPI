It is using FileReader to read the file as ArrayBuffer and then sending it as raw data. Instead, you can use the FormData object to send the file as multipart/form-data. Here is an example of how you can modify the sendFile() function in the client code:\n\nfunction sendFile() {\n  var file = document.getElementById('filename').files[0];\n  var formData = new FormData();\n  formData.append('file', file);\n\n  var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n  xhr.open('POST', 'http://localhost:8887/upload', true);\n  xhr.onload = function() {\n    if (xhr.status === 200) {\n      alert('File uploaded successfully.');\n    } else {\n      alert('Error uploading file.');\n    }\n  };\n  xhr.send(formData);\n}\n\nYou will also need to modify the websocket server code to handle the file upload. Instead of using FileChannel.write, you can use the standard Java I/O classes to write the file.

I dont want to have to specify the number of bytes to read. I want to be able to read the object directly using Object Input Stream. How to achieve this ? I have to use Random Access Files because I need to write to different positions in file.
