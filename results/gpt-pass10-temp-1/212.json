So when you assign the result of `input.read()` to `int r`, it will only store the lower 8 bits of the value. That's why you're seeing a value of 65533 (0xFFFD in hexadecimal) for byte values above 127. By using a byte array and reading into that array using `is.read(buffer)`, you can read multiple bytes at once and properly handle values above 127. You just need to use bitwise AND (`&`) with `0xFF` to get the unsigned byte value."

To correctly handle bytes with values greater than 127 (i.e., byte values considered as negative), you need to convert the `int` value to an unsigned byte value using the bitwise AND operator (`&`) with `0xFF`. This will ensure that the received byte value is properly preserved within the range of 0 to 255."

It is recommended to read blocks of data using a byte array. In the provided code snippet, a byte array called \"buffer\" is created and used to read data from the input stream in chunks of 1024 bytes. The bytesRead variable keeps track of the number of bytes read in each iteration. The for loop then iterates over the bytes read and handles each value appropriately. By using the \"& 0xFF\" operation, the signed byte is converted to an unsigned int, which should solve the issue of receiving values greater than or equal to 128 as 65533."

This will ensure that the value is treated as an unsigned byte instead of a signed byte. By default, Java treats bytes as signed values, so any value >= 128 will be interpreted as a negative value. Masking it with 0xFF will remove the sign bit and give you the correct unsigned value."

It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Any byte >= 128 is received as 65533: :I am implementing a server on Android and I am using:while (!Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) {    try {        int r;        String response = \"\";        while ((r = input.read()) > 0) {        ...        }    ...}I have two issues. If the client sends me a byte of value 0, it is not received by the server. The second issue is, if the byte value is 128 or more, I keep receiving a value of 65533 or a binary value of 11111101.
