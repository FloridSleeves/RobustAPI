When you call println(), it does not immediately write the data to the file, but instead buffers it. Without closing the PrintWriter, the buffer may not be flushed to the file and you may end up missing some data. \nTo ensure that all the data is written to the file, you should close the PrintWriter by calling out.close() after writing the data."

The PrintWriter class does not flush its output, so it is important to explicitly call the close() method on the PrintWriter object to ensure that all data is written to the file. Additionally, the print() method is used to write the data without appending a new line character, which will prevent any missing data in the output file."

By default, PrintWriter uses a buffer and does not immediately write the data to the file. When you call `out.println(result)`, it does not necessarily write all the characters from the `result` string immediately. To ensure that all the data is written to the file, you can use a BufferedWriter along with PrintWriter. This will allow you to manually flush the buffer and ensure that all the data is written."
