If a class has multiple concerns and it becomes difficult to mock only certain methods, it might be a sign that the class is violating the Single Responsibility Principle and should be refactored into smaller, more focused classes.\n\nPartial mocking can make tests more fragile and harder to understand, as it allows us to modify the behavior of only certain methods, potentially leading to unexpected interactions between different parts of the code. It can also make tests harder to maintain, as changes in the class being mocked might require corresponding changes in the partial mock.\n\nInstead of relying on partial mocking, it is generally recommended to follow the SOLID principles and strive for better design. Extracting smaller, more focused classes can help to separate concerns, making testing and mocking easier.\n\nHowever, there may be cases where partial mocking is necessary or the most efficient solution. In such situations, it is important to carefully consider the trade-offs and make sure the benefits outweigh the potential drawbacks.\n\nIn summary, partially mocking can be a useful tool in certain situations but might indicate a design problem.

It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time.

However, often i find writing partial mocks time consuming, and it does not feel 'right'.I'd say its a design fault as my class I try to mock has multiple concerns into one, therefore I should create seperate classes in order to seperate concerns.What do you think? Is partially mocking a good or bad thing? And, if good/bad, why? What would you suggest if you notice you cannot mock the object because you only want to mock a few methods?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
