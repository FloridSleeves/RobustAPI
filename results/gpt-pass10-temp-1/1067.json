To fix this issue, you can update the while loop condition to `(counter > 1 || counter == 1)`.\n\nHere's the updated code:\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\n\npublic class NewClass {\n    \n    /**\n     * @param args the command line arguments\n     */\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        int maxCounter= 0;\n        int input;\n        int lowerBound;\n        int upperBound;\n        int counter;\n        int numberOfCycles;\n        int maxCycles= 0;\n        int lowerInt;\n        BufferedReader consoleInput = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\n        String line = consoleInput.readLine();\n        String[] splitted =  line.split(\" \");\n        lowerBound = Integer.parseInt(splitted[0]);\n        upperBound = Integer.parseInt(splitted[1]);\n        int[] recentlyused =  new int[1000001];\n        \n        if (lowerBound > upperBound ){\n            int h = upperBound;\n            upperBound = lowerBound;\n            lowerBound = h;\n        }\n        \n        lowerInt = lowerBound;\n        \n        while (lowerBound <= upperBound)\n        {\n            counter = lowerBound;\n            numberOfCycles = 0;\n            \n            if (recentlyused[counter] == 0)\n            {\n                while (counter > 1 || counter == 1)\n                {\n                    if (recentlyused[counter] != 0)\n                    {\n                        numberOfCycles = recentlyused[counter] + numberOfCycles;\n                        counter = 1;\n                    }\n                    else\n                    {\n                        if (counter % 2 == 0)\n                        {\n                            counter = counter / 2;\n                        }\n                        else\n                        {\n                            counter = 3*counter + 1;\n                        }\n                        numberOfCycles++;\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                numberOfCycles = recentlyused[counter] + numberOfCycles;\n                counter = 1;\n            }\n            \n            recentlyused[lowerBound] = numberOfCycles;\n            \n            if (numberOfCycles > maxCycles)\n            {\n                maxCycles = numberOfCycles;\n            }\n            \n            lowerBound++;\n        }\n        \n        System.out.println(lowerInt +\" \"+ upperBound+ \" \"+ (maxCycles+1));\n    }\n}\n```\n\nExplanation: I have added a condition `(counter > 1 || counter == 1)` to the while loop to ensure that the loop executes when counter becomes 1 as well.

One way to force Java to read in empty fields is to create a customized implementation of the StringTokenizer class. In the given code, a method named \"getStringTokenizerStrict\" is provided which implements a strict version of the StringTokenizer class. This method takes in a string, delimiter, and a boolean flag to indicate whether to include NULL tokens. It processes the tokens, adding an extra space before each delimiter if the token is equal to the delimiter itself. This ensures that empty fields are not skipped over.

As you can see an empty field is still correctly surrounded by tabs. Data is collected using a loop :\n\n while ((strLine = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(strLine, \"\t\");\n    String test = st.nextToken();\n    ...\n    }\nYet Java ignores this \"empty string\" and skips the field.\n\nIs there a way to circumvent this behaviour and force java to read in empty fields anyway?\nPlease using this api: StringTokenizer.nextToken.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: StringTokenizer.nextToken\n<<<code>>>: public class TestStringTokenStrict {\n\n/**\n * Strict implementation of StringTokenizer\n * \n * @param str\n * @param delim\n * @param strict\n *            true = include NULL Token\n * @return\n */\nstatic StringTokenizer getStringTokenizerStrict(String str, String delim, boolean strict) {\n    StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(str, delim, strict);\n    StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();\n\n    while (st.hasMoreTokens()) {\n        String s = st.nextToken();\n        if (s.equals(delim)) {\n            sb.append(\" \").append(delim);\n        } else {\n            sb.append(s).append(delim);\n            if (st.hasMoreTokens())\n                st.nextToken();\n        }\n    }\n    return (new StringTokenizer(sb.toString(), delim));\n}\n\nstatic void altStringTokenizer(StringTokenizer st) {\n    while (st.hasMoreTokens()) {\n        String type = st.nextToken();\n        String one = st.nextToken();\n        String two = st.nextToken();\n        String three = st.nextToken();\n        String four = st.nextToken();\n        String five = st.nextToken();\n\n        System.out.println(\n                \"[\" + type + \"] [\" + one + \"] [\" + two + \"] [\" + three + \"] [\" + four + \"] [\" + five + \"]\");\n    }\n}\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    String input = \"Record|One||Three||Five\";\n    altStringTokenizer(getStringTokenizerStrict(input, \"|\", true));\n}}\n<<<explanation>>>: The object your method decompressGZIP() needs is a byte[].\n\nSo the basic, technical answer to the question you have asked is:\nQuestion: Uva's 3n+1 problem: :I'm solving Uva's 3n+1 problem and I don't get why the judge is rejecting my answer.
