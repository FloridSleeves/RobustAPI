First, it was calling `scFile.next()` instead of `scFile.nextLine()` in the outer while loop. This would only read the next word instead of the entire line. Second, it was not checking if the scanner has the next element before calling `sc.next()`. This caused the `NoSuchElementException` when there were no more elements to read. By changing the condition to `sc.hasNext()` in the inner while loop, it ensures that there are still elements to read before calling `sc.next()`."

                "content": "<<<explanation>>>: The issue is with your code for reading from the file. \n\nYou are using `scFile.next()` in the line `Scanner sc = new Scanner(scFile.next()).useDelimiter(\"#\");`. This will only read the next token from the file, which is not what you want. Instead, you should be using `scFile.nextLine()` to read the whole line from the file.\n\nHere is the corrected code:\n\n```java\npublic RecordManager(){\n    int pos;\n    String athlete, record, country, raceTime;\n    try {\n        Scanner scFile = new Scanner(new File(\"resultdata.txt\"));\n        while(scFile.hasNextLine()){\n            Scanner sc = new Scanner(scFile.nextLine()).useDelimiter(\"#\");\n            athlete = sc.next();\n            country = sc.next();\n            pos = sc.nextInt();\n            record = sc.next();\n            raceTime = sc.next();\n            \n            sc.close();\n            \n            if(\"WRC\".equals(record)){\n                resultArr[size] = new WorldRecord(athlete, country, pos, raceTime);\n            }\n            else if(\"OLR\".equals(record)){\n                resultArr[size] = new OlympicRecord(athlete, country, pos, raceTime);\n            }\n            else{\n                resultArr[size] = new RaceResult(athlete, country, pos, raceTime);\n            }\n            size++;\n        }\n    } catch (FileNotFoundException ex) {\n        Logger.getLogger(RecordManager.class.getName()).log(Level.SEVERE, null, ex);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code reads each line using `scFile.nextLine()` and then uses `sc.next()` to parse individual tokens from each line.\n\nNote: Make sure the file \"resultdata.txt\" is in the correct location and accessible by your program."
