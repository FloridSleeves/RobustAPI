This is because the read() method returns an int value, and its range is from 0 to 255. When the read() method reads the byte value -1, it is sign-extended to an int value of -1, which is represented by all bits being 1. \n\nWhen you add -1, 1, and 0, the sign bit of -1 is retained, resulting in -1 + 1 + 0 = -1. However, when you print the result, it is being converted to its hexadecimal representation, which is 0xFFFFFFFF. The System.out.println() method treats the integer value as a signed value, so it prints -1 as -1 + 256 = 255. \n\nTo get the expected result of 0, you can use the following code: \n\nbyte[] bytes = new byte[] { -1, 1, 0x0 };\nInputStream in = new ByteArrayInputStream(bytes);\nint result = in.read() + in.read() + in.read();\nresult = result & 0xFF; \nSystem.out.println(result);"

The read() method of ByteArrayInputStream returns an integer value that represents the next byte of data from the input stream.\n\nIn Java, bytes are represented using 8 bits and are signed, meaning they can have negative values (-128 to 127). When you read a byte from the ByteArrayInputStream, it returns the byte as an integer value, where the lower 8 bits represent the actual byte value and the upper 24 bits are sign-extension bits.\n\nIn the code snippet you provided, the byte array contains the values {-1, 1, 0x0}. When you call in.read() three times, the first in.read() returns -1 as an integer value, which is represented as 0xFFFFFFFF in hexadecimal. The second in.read() returns 1, which is represented as 0x00000001. The third in.read() returns 0 as 0x00000000.\n\nWhen you add these integers together, you get 0xFFFFFFFF + 0x00000001 + 0x00000000 = 0x100000000. This value exceeds the range of integers in Java, so it overflows and wraps around to become 0x00000000, which is 0 in decimal.\n\nTherefore, the expression in.read() + in.read() + in.read() evaluates to 0, not 256 as you mentioned.\n\nIt's important to note that the behavior of ByteArrayInputStream.read() is consistent with Java's signed byte representation and arithmetic calculations."
