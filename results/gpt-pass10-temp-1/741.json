This can cause compatibility issues with different browsers. By using setHeader() instead of addHeader(), you ensure that any existing value for the header is replaced.\n\nAlso, make sure that the offerType variable does not contain any special characters that could cause issues with the file extension.

That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Content-Disposition file extension not properly working on Firefox: :I have the following code on Spring Controller @RequestMapping(value = \"/download\", method = RequestMethod.POST) public void downloadActive(@RequestParam(value = \"type\") String offerType, HttpServletResponse response,            HttpSession session) throws Exception { StringBuilder b = new StringBuilder();...response.addHeader(\"Content-Disposition: \", \"attachment; filename=my\" + offerType + \"Offers.csv\");response.getWriter().write(b.toString());..}This code get executed when a download button from EXt Js is clicked. On chrome, it directly downloads the file as a *.csv format and when the user opens it, it will use Excel automatically to open the file, if they already have installed and this is the right behavior I wanted to have.However, on firefox, it prompts a save as window with open with and save options. If I use open with option, it tells me the filename is filename.csv but the type is chrome htm file. I haven't mentioned htm anywhere in my code and I dont know why its trying  to open it as htm instead of csv file. Once it tries to open it, it brings excel application and the contents are in a bad format.Is there a way to avoid this problem on firefox ?Thanks\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
