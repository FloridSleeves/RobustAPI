The requested API(PrintWriter.write) does not seem to be relevant to the question about implementing an UncaughtExceptionHandler for Servlets. However, I can provide an answer for implementing an UncaughtExceptionHandler in Servlets:\n\nTo implement an UncaughtExceptionHandler for Servlets, you can use a try-catch block within the doXxx() method of the servlet, and then handle the exception accordingly. Here is an example:\n\nprotected void doPost(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) {\n    try {\n        int i = 1/0;\n    } catch (Exception e) {\n        // Handle the exception\n        LOGGER.error(\"Uncaught Exception\", e);\n    }\n}\n\nIn this example, any exception that occurs within the doPost() method will be caught by the try-catch block, and the error will be logged using the LOGGER object. You can replace LOGGER.error() with any other handling logic that you need.\n\nAdditionally, you may also consider implementing a custom error page in your web.xml file to handle exceptions globally within your servlet application. This can be done by specifying an error-page element with an exception-type and location attributes."
