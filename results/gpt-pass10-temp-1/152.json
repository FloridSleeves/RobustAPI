Since this method only operates on the local variables and does not share any state between threads, it should be safe to invoke it in parallel from multiple threads. However, it is important to note that whether the end result of each execution can be guaranteed without any race conditions also depends on the nature of the files being compared and the specific use case implementation. For example, if the files are being modified by multiple threads at the same time, race conditions can still occur. It is always recommended to handle thread synchronization and concurrency issues appropriately when working with multiple threads accessing and modifying shared resources."

It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Multiple threads invoking apache commons io FileUtils.contentEquals() static method in parallel: :What will happen if multiple threads invoke the apache commons io FileUtils.contentEquals() static method in parallel?
