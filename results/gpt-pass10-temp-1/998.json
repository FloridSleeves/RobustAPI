The Server class creates a ServerSocket and waits for a client to connect using server.accept(). The Client class has a separate thread to listen for data from the server and reads it line by line using the BufferedReader's readLine() method, causing the code to hang at that point. It appears that the client is unable to receive any data from the server.\n\nPossible solutions:\n- Check if the client and server are running on the same machine and using the same port.\n- Check if any firewalls or security settings are blocking the connection.\n- Make sure that the server is sending data to the client using the PrintWriter's println() method.\n- Make sure that the server is flushing the output stream using the PrintWriter's flush() method.\n- Check if the server is closing the output stream before the client reads all the data.\n- Double check the server code for any bugs or issues in handling client connections.\n\nPlease keep in mind that without knowing the full context and dependencies of the code, it is difficult to provide a definitive solution."

The loop is waiting for data to be read using `input.readLine()`, but it doesn't have a mechanism to exit the loop if no data is received. Therefore, it gets stuck at this line and doesn't progress. To fix this, you can add a sleep statement inside the loop to give time for data to be read before checking if the connection is closed.\n\nIn the Client class, there is a problem with the `post` method. The method checks for errors using `output.checkError()` after sending the data. However, before checking for errors, you need to flush the output stream to ensure that the data is actually sent. Therefore, you should add `output.flush()` before `return !output.checkError()`.\n\nThese changes should fix the issue you're facing with the BufferedReader hanging and the connection not forming properly."

We are about to listen!Connection Closed!where the empty line represents the non null data received over the course of the connection, ie that there is none.I expect this:Attempting to Establish ConnectionServer Online!We are about to listen!thump thumpthump thumpthump thump (and so on, every second)Connection closed!I spent time performing different tests by commenting out or changing the code slightly with the same testing format (except for the special case, which is number 6) and made these observations:ObservationsOnly when the socket is closed and the output stream is closed, does the program move past the offending line.When the readline() method starts to process (shortly before the heartbeat cuts it off) it detects nothing in the stream, not even THUMP_THUMP.When the socket is closed, but the output stream is not, the readline() method starts to process, only to detect nothing, heartbeat cuts it off. No SocketException even though it would be expected.If the socket is NOT closed, and only the output stream is closed, a SocketException is triggered, suggesting the socket is closed.I used netstat -an in command prompt, and when the server is started the port 1234 is LISTENING. When the client connects, it is still LISTENING, implying that there is no connection.I set up some python code to connect to itself over port 1234,however I made a mistake in the python code, and as such the serverdidn't close, and was still open. So I decided to connect the javaclient to the server and see what happens. I did this by runningClient(null) which is the client code for the non-host. Itresulted in the port reading ESTABLISHED, and the python server wasechoing back the \"thump thump\", and the java code was successfullyreading it. No hanging, it worked perfectly.This leads me to believe that the problem lies in the server code, as the python server was able to communicate sucessfully with the Java client, but the Java client is unable to communicate with the Java server.Before performing this testing I had been concentrating on the Client code, believing that it was at fault. All the questions I have found here with similar symptoms (see here, here and here, among others) have turned up blank for me, having written in their solutions (most were due to the output stream not flushing, or the \\n ommitted, which I have not failed to do, or the solution not fixing my problem, and so having been removed in favor of the heartbeat in this case). I originally based my code off of this article.After 4 days of trying to figure out this problem I am at a loss for what to do... What am I missing here? Why is the Server code not working as I expect it to? If anybody needs any more clarification on my code then please ask!As an after-note, the testing code is run through a simple minimalistic GUI written in javafx (not fxml though), whether that would be a problem or not I'm sure, I would think not, due to it working with the Python server. This code is compiled in Java 8\nPlease using this api: String.getBytes.\nAnswer:"
