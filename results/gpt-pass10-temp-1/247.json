However, the issue you are facing with the UTFDataFormatException might be due to a mismatch in the encoding used while writing the data in C# and reading the data in Java. Make sure that the encoding used in both cases is the same. Additionally, ensure that the file is properly closed after reading to avoid any resource leaks."

However, the UTFDataFormatException you are getting indicates that there might be an issue with the format of the data in the file. \n\nOne thing to note is that the DataInputStream.readUTF() method expects the string to be in a specific format called Modified UTF-8. If the C# BinaryWriter is not using this format to write the strings, then you will get this exception.\n\nTo handle this, you might need to look at how the C# BinaryWriter is encoding the strings and modify your Java code accordingly. One possible solution is to use a different method for reading the strings, such as reading the bytes and then converting them to a string using a specific character encoding. You can use the InputStream.read(byte[]) method to read the bytes.\n\nHere is an example code snippet for reading the strings using the InputStream.read(byte[]) method:\n\nFileInputStream fs = new FileInputStream(strFilePath);\nDataInputStream ds = new DataInputStream(fs);\n\nint i = ds.readInt();\n\nbyte[] bytes1 = new byte[ds.readShort()];\nds.read(bytes1);\nString str1 = new String(bytes1, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);\n\nbyte[] bytes2 = new byte[ds.readShort()];\nds.read(bytes2);\nString str2 = new String(bytes2, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);\n\nbyte[] bytes3 = new byte[ds.readShort()];\nds.read(bytes3);\nString str3 = new String(bytes3, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);\n\nds.close();\n\nThis code assumes that the C# BinaryWriter is writing the strings using the UTF-8 encoding and also includes the length of each string before writing the actual bytes. The InputStream.readShort() method is used to read the length of each string, and then the corresponding number of bytes is read and converted to a string using the UTF-8 encoding. Make sure to replace StandardCharsets.UTF_8 with the appropriate character encoding if the C# BinaryWriter is using a different encoding."

It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time.
