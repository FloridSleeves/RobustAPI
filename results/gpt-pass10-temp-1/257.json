Use the HSSFWorkbook or XSSFWorkbook class based on the type of your Excel file (XLS or XLSX). For example,\n\n```java\nFile file = new File(\"path/to/your/excel/file.xlsx\");\nWorkbook workbook = new XSSFWorkbook(file);\nSheet sheet = workbook.getSheetAt(0);\n```\n\n3. Iterate over the rows and cells of the sheet to retrieve the data.

Start by adding the Apache POI dependencies to your project. You can do this by including the following dependencies in your build file (e.g., Maven, Gradle, etc.):\n   - For .xls (HSSF - Horrible Spreadsheet Format) format:\n     ```xml\n     <dependency>\n         <groupId>org.apache.poi</groupId>\n         <artifactId>poi</artifactId>\n         <version>4.1.2</version>\n     </dependency>\n     ```\n   - For .xlsx (XSSF - XML Spreadsheet Format) format:\n     ```xml\n     <dependency>\n         <groupId>org.apache.poi</groupId>\n         <artifactId>poi-ooxml</artifactId>\n         <version>4.1.2</version>\n     </dependency>\n     ```\n\n2.
