It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Results printing to console but not to the file: :I'm trying to print to a .csv like so:(A and B are ArrayLists of type String)for(int i = 0; i < A.size(); i++) {    PrintWriter output = new PrintWriter(csvFile);    System.out.println(A.get(i)+\", \"+ B.get(i));    output.println(A.get(i)+\", \"+ B.get(i));}I'm getting the desired results to the console, however when I try to overwrite the file I am reading from, it is completely blank.  Any ideas?  I do need to overwrite the file as I don't want the original data preserved.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
