Make sure that you are setting the character encoding correctly in your code. In this case, you have already set the character encoding to \"utf-8\" using the `resp.setCharacterEncoding(\"utf-8\")` statement. However, you are using `resp.getWriter()` multiple times to get the PrintWriter object, which can cause issues with the encoding. \nTo fix this, you can use `resp.getWriter().write(\"\u6211\u662f\u4eba\")` instead of `out.println(\"\u6211\u662f\u4eba\")`. This will ensure that the response is written with the correct encoding."
