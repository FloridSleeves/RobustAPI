BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. By adding \"output.newLine();\" after \"output.write(msg);\", you add a line break after each command. Additionally, calling \"output.flush();\" immediately flushes the buffer and ensures the command is sent immediately."

You need to explicitly add a new line character after writing the message using `output.newLine()`. Additionally, you should call `output.flush()` to make sure the message is sent immediately."

The output.newLine() method adds a line break, and the output.flush() method flushes the buffered writer, ensuring that the command is sent immediately. Without the line break, the command may not be recognized by the receiving application."

How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Sending commands to a console application?: :I want to verify something, because in my head it makes sense, but in Java, it doesn't work.I am trying to run another Jar file through my application. A Minecraft server, to be precise. I have all the basics down (using ProcessBuilder, executing with arguments, waiting for an exit code, etc.), but there is one thing that I cannot figure out. Sending commands to the application. Here part of my CommandLineSender class:public class CommandLineSender extends Thread {    private BufferedWriter output;    private InputStream source;  // Set to System.in when creating the object    private boolean stopRequested;    public CommandLineSender(Process sendTo, InputStream source) {        this.output = new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(sendTo.getOutputStream()));        this.source = source;        System.out.println(\"Source InputStream initiated: \" + source.toString());        this.stopRequested = false;    }    @Override    public void run() {        System.out.println(\"Run called.\");        Scanner cmdScanner = new Scanner(source);        while (cmdScanner.hasNextLine() && !stopRequested) {            System.out.println(\"Has next line\");            String msg = cmdScanner.nextLine();            write(msg);            System.out.println(\"Wrote: \" + msg);        }        // Close the scanner and BufferedWriter        System.out.println(\"Closed.\");    }    // Other various methods    protected void write(String msg) {        try {            output.write(msg);        } catch (IOException e) {            System.err.println(\"Unable to write message because of an unhandled IOException: \" + e.getMessage());        }    }The output I get is this:(Default Minecraft server output)help  // My commandHas next lineWrote: helpThis may not matter, but I am executing my server with these arguments:java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar (path to server jar) noguiThank you for your time.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
