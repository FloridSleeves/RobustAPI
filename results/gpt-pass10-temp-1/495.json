Each concurrent call to the API will get its own iterator and can then call `iterator.next()` to get the next student row from the list. This way, each call will work on a different student row. Note that this assumes that the list of student rows returned by `StudentDAO.getRows()` is ordered in the desired way (e.g., by student ID or some other identifier)."
