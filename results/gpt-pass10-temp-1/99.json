Create a DataOutputStream using the FileOutputStream:\n   DataOutputStream dataOutputStream = new DataOutputStream(fileOutputStream);\n   \n3. Write the TIFF header using the DataOutputStream. You can use the DataOutputStream.write method to write each header field according to its data type and length. For example, to write the SubFileType field:\n   dataOutputStream.writeShort(1); // SubFileType: 1 (LONG)\n   dataOutputStream.writeShort(0); // Type: LONG\n   dataOutputStream.writeInt(1); // Count: 1\n   dataOutputStream.writeInt(0); // Offset: 0\n   \n   // Write other header fields in a similar way\n   \n4.
