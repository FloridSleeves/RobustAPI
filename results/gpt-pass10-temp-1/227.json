It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: How to read/write a 2d char array through a Socket?: :So I am writing a game of LAN tic-tac-toe. I have the \"board\" stored as a 2 dimensional char array. I want to be able to send and receive this array through Sockets. I am currently using a InputStream and OutputStream to send single bytes. However, I don't think this will work for sending the array. Also, these streams only seem capable of sending int type data. Can someone please explain to me how too send 2 dimensional char arrays over sockets using I/O streams. Example code would be great! Thanks.
