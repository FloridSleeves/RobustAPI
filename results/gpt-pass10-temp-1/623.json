Note that this will make a solution.\nQuestion: Why?: :I have a pretty large Hashmap (~250MB). Creating it takes about 50-55 seconds, so I decided to serialize it and save it to a file. Reading from the file takes about 16-17 seconds now.The only problem is that lookups seems to be slower this way. I always thought that the hashmap is read from the file into the memory, so the performance should be the same compared to the case when I create the hashmap myself, right? Here is the code I am using to read the hashmap into a file:File file = new File(\"omaha.ser\");FileInputStream f = new FileInputStream(file);ObjectInputStream s = new ObjectInputStream(new BufferedInputStream(f));omahaMap = (HashMap<Long, Integer>) s.readObject();s.close();300 million lookups take about 3.1 seconds when I create the hashmap myself, and about 8.5 seconds when I read the same hashmap from file. Does anybody have an idea why? Am I overlooking something obvious? EDIT:I \"measured\" the time by just taking the time with System.nanotime(), so no proper benchmark method used. Here is the code:public class HandEvaluationTest{    public static void Test()    {        HandEvaluation.populate5Card();        HandEvaluation.populate9CardOmaha();        Card[] player1cards = {new Card(\"4s\"), new Card(\"2s\"), new Card(\"8h\"), new Card(\"4d\")};        Card[] player2cards = {new Card(\"As\"), new Card(\"9s\"), new Card(\"6c\"), new Card(\"2h\")};        Card[] player3cards = {new Card(\"9h\"), new Card(\"7h\"), new Card(\"Kc\"), new Card(\"Kh\")};        Card[] table = {new Card(\"2d\"), new Card(\"2c\"), new Card(\"3c\"), new Card(\"5c\"), new Card(\"4h\")};        int j=0, k=0, l=0;        long startTime = System.nanoTime();        for(int p=0; p<100000000; p++)    {           j = HandEvaluation.handEval9Hash(player1cards, table);            k = HandEvaluation.handEval9Hash(player2cards, table);            l = HandEvaluation.handEval9Hash(player3cards, table);        }        long estimatedTime = System.nanoTime() - startTime;        System.out.println(\"Time needed: \" + estimatedTime*Math.pow(10,-6) + \"ms\");        System.out.println(\"Handstrength Player 1: \" + j);        System.out.println(\"Handstrength Player 2: \" + k);        System.out.println(\"Handstrength Player 3: \" + l);    }}The big hashmap work is done in HandEvaluation.populate9CardOmaha().
