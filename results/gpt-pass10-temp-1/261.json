Whenever you need to display the player count, you can use this variable instead of the actual player count.\n\nFor example:\n\nint virtualPlayerCount = 42;\n\n// Whenever you need to display the player count\nint currentPlayerCount = virtualPlayerCount;\nSystem.out.println(\"Current Player Count: \" + currentPlayerCount);\n\nRegarding the max players, you can indeed use the setMaxPlayers(int mxPlayers) method from the ServerListPingEvent to set a virtual max player count. This will affect the number displayed in the server list.\n\nAs for getting the online players via a query in a plugin, it depends on the specific plugin and how it handles player queries. If the plugin provides a method to get the online players, you can use that method to retrieve the virtual player count. However, if the plugin only supports the actual player count, you may need to modify the plugin code to implement the virtual player count functionality.\n\nRemember that the virtual player count and max players are not the actual number of online players, so you will need to manage them manually in your code."

This method allows you to set the maximum number of players that will be displayed to clients when they ping the server.\n\nHowever, for the online player count, you will need to handle it separately. One approach could be to create a custom logic in your plugin that tracks the virtual player count and updates it based on certain conditions. For example, you can keep a counter variable that increments or decrements based on certain events in your game or plugin.\n\nRegarding querying the player count in a plugin, you can use the Bukkit API to get a list of online players. You can then use the `size()` method on the list to determine the number of online players. Here's an example:\n\n```\nint virtualPlayerCount = ... // your custom logic to determine the virtual player count\n\n// Get the online players\nList<Player> onlinePlayers = Bukkit.getOnlinePlayers();\nint actualPlayerCount = onlinePlayers.size();\n\n// Use the virtualPlayerCount instead of the actualPlayerCount\n```\n\nPlease note that the `Bukkit` class is part of the Bukkit API, and you will need to have the appropriate dependencies and imports in your plugin to use it.\n\nRemember to update the virtual player count whenever the player count changes in your game or plugin."

However, you can achieve a similar effect by simply displaying a random or arbitrary number as the player count or max players.\nFor example, you can use a random number generator to generate a random player count within a certain range, or you can set a fixed value as the player count and max players that doesn't reflect the actual number of players.\nIf you're using a plugin, you can create a custom command or method that returns the virtual player count or max players that you've set.\nHere's an example of how you can set a virtual number for the max players using the `setMaxPlayers` method:\n\nServerListPingEvent event;\nevent.setMaxPlayers(100);\n\nThis will set the virtual max player count to 100.\nAs for getting the online players via a query in a plugin, it depends on the specific API and plugin you're using.

It will still show the real number of players connected to the server. However, you can create a custom variable to store and display the virtual player count. You can update this variable whenever a player joins or leaves the server.\n\nAs for querying the players in a plugin, you can use the Bukkit.getServer().getOnlinePlayers() method to get a collection of currently online players. From there, you can iterate through the collection and manipulate the player data as needed.\n\nRemember to update the virtual player count whenever a player joins or leaves the server, and also handle any events that may affect the player count to keep it in sync with the actual player count."
