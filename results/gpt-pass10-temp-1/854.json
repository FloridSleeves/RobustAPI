The last 6 bytes in my files contain crucial information when writing the files back. I need to write my original files, and then append the last 6 bytes elsewhere. Any guidance? Thanks\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: RandomAccessFile.read\n<<<code>>>: RandomAccessFile randomAccessFile = new RandomAccessFile(your_file, \"r\");randomAccessFile.seek(your_file.length() - n);try{randomAccessFile.read(byteArray, 0, n);} catch(IOException e) {e.printStackTrace();} \n<<<explanation>>>: You have to do it by using RandomAccessFile. Instances of this class support both reading and writing to a random access file. A random access file behaves like a large array of bytes stored in the file system. \nQuestion: How to choose RandomAccessFile dynamically?: :I had written a program using RandomAccessFile class to read binary data.  The code is as followsRandomAccessFile in = new RandomAccessFile('BOT.GRD', \"r\");in.read(a);Now I want to choose file dynamically rather than providing directly as above. I tried a lot and I was unable to do that. Can any one help me on this?\nPlease using this api: RandomAccessFile.read.\nAnswer:"
