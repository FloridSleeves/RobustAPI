When you introduce the sleep, it's causing the program to pause for a brief moment, which allows the CPU to cool down. This cooling down affects the turbo-boost feature, leading to lower performance on server2. To improve server2 performance in this case, you could consider disabling the turbo-boost feature in the BIOS settings."

The performance difference you are seeing is most likely due to the difference in the number of cores between the two servers. Server1 has 4 cores while server2 has 6 cores. In your test program, you are creating a loop and printing a string repeatedly. When you uncomment the \"Thread.sleep(1)\" part, you introduce a small delay in each iteration of the loop. This causes the CPU to idle for a brief period of time, which allows other processes/threads to utilize the CPU resources. Since server2 has more cores, it can handle the extra load more efficiently, resulting in a faster execution time compared to server1. It's important to note that other factors, such as the CPU architecture and cache size, can also have an impact on performance. Additionally, BIOS settings, power management settings, and background processes running on the servers can also affect the overall performance."

It could be due to various factors such as CPU speed, memory allocation, operating system configuration, etc. In order to improve the performance on server2, you can try the following steps:\n\n1. Check CPU utilization: Monitor the CPU usage on both servers during the execution of your program. If server2 is not utilizing its full CPU power, there could be other factors affecting its performance. You can use tools like `top` or `htop` to check CPU usage.\n\n2. Check memory allocation: Ensure that server2 has enough memory allocated to it. You can use tools like `free` or `top` to check the memory usage on both servers. If server2 has insufficient memory, it could affect the performance of your program.\n\n3. Check BIOS settings: Although the BIOS settings may be similar, there could still be some differences that could affect the performance. Update the BIOS on server2 and check if it improves the performance.\n\n4. Check JVM settings: Check the JVM settings on both servers and make sure they are configured similarly. You can check the JVM settings using the `java -XX:+PrintFlagsFinal` command.\n\n5. Monitor system resources: Monitor other system resources such as disk I/O, network bandwidth, etc. to check if any of these factors are affecting the performance of server2.\n\nPlease note that these are general suggestions and may or may not directly impact the performance of your program. It is recommended to analyze the specific requirements and constraints of your application and perform appropriate optimizations accordingly."
