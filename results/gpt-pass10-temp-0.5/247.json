To read the data correctly, you will need to use a compatible format for writing and reading the data between C# and Java. One option is to use a common format such as JSON or XML for writing and reading the data. Another option is to use a binary format that is compatible with both C# and Java, such as Google's Protocol Buffers or Apache Thrift."

It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time.
