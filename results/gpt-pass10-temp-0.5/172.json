The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Java SAX parsing. Getting access to file lines in the currently parsing xml file: :When parsing an XML document, you can set a locator, the locator will tell you what current line and column number your are currently on when different events fire. I am wondering, how can I get the contents of the line, do I have to pass the file, read it into an array myself, isn't this already done by the sax handler, since it is giving me access to the locator, there has to be away to also access the file that the handler is currently working with. Thanks! ::::::::::::::::::::::::::EDIT:::::::::::::::::::I am trying to echo an xml file and want doctype declarations to be included: <!DOCTYPE employee [<!ELEMENT employee (Name, Dept, Title)><!ELEMENT Name (#PCDATA)> <!ELEMENT Dept (#PCDATA)><!ELEMENT Title (#PCDATA)> ]>There is a public void startDTD(String name, String publicId, String systemId);and a public void endDTD();Where you can use the locator to get current line and column, and read from file.There are a couple of things that the SAX parser does not fire events on or give sufficient information as to what was in the read XML file. \nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
