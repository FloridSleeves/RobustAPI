That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: How to empty file content and then append text multiple times: :I have a file (file.txt), and I need to empty his current content, and then to append some text multiple times.Example: file.txt current content is:aaabbbcccI want to remove this content, and then to append the first time:dddThe second time:eeeAnd so on...I tried this:// empty the current contentfileOut = new FileWriter(\"file.txt\");fileOut.write(\"\");fileOut.close();// appendfileOut = new FileWriter(\"file.txt\", true);// when I want to write something I just do this multiple times:fileOut.write(\"text\");fileOut.flush();This works fine, but it seems inefficient because I open the file 2 times just for remove the current content.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
