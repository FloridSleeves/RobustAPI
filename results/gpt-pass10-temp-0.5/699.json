It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: writing a file in directory using printwriter in java: :file is not creating in my workspace or in any folder, can any one suggect specify a directory and also have to use \"UTF-8\"PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"twitterData_\"+currDate+\".txt\", \"UTF-8\");            writer.println(\"TweetId,UserScreenName,Tweet,TimeStamp\");\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
