In your case, it returns UTF-8, which means the JVM is using UTF-8 as the default encoding for reading and writing files. However, this does not guarantee that the output file will be encoded in UTF-8.\n\nTo ensure that the output file is encoded in UTF-8, you need to explicitly specify the encoding when writing to the file. You can do this by using a BufferedWriter with an OutputStreamWriter that specifies the UTF-8 encoding:\n\nBufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(new FileOutputStream(filename), \"UTF-8\"));\nwriter.write(\"Your text here\");\nwriter.close();\n\nThis will ensure that the output file is encoded in UTF-8 regardless of how you run the program (via Eclipse or from a JAR file)."
