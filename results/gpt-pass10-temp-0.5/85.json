To fix this, you can add a check before parsing the clientCountString as an integer. Here's an updated version of your server-side code:\n\n```java\ntry {\n    byte[] data = new byte[35 * 1024];\n    System.out.println(\"STARTING LOOP\");\n    System.out.println(\"***********************************\");\n    int messageCounter = 0;\n    int clientMessageCount = 0;\n    String clientCountString = \"\";\n    byte[] clientCount = new byte[5];\n    while (true) {\n        in.read(data);\n        clientCount[0] = data[0];\n        clientCount[1] = data[1];\n        clientCount[2] = data[2];\n        clientCount[3] = data[3];\n        clientCount[4] = data[4];\n        clientCountString = new String(clientCount);\n        System.out.println(\"Received Count String: \\\"\" + clientCountString + \"\\\"\");\n        clientCountString = clientCountString.replace(\"*\", \"\");\n        if (!clientCountString.isEmpty()) {\n            clientMessageCount = Integer.parseInt(clientCountString);\n        } else {\n            clientMessageCount = -1; // Set a default value if the string is empty\n        }\n        System.out.println(\"Client Count: \" + clientMessageCount + \", Server Count: \" + messageCounter);\n        out.write(data);\n        System.out.println(\"***********************************\");\n        messageCounter++;\n    }\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n} finally {\n    // Close the input and output streams and the socket\n    try {\n        in.close();\n        out.close();\n        clientSocket.close();\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis updated code checks if the clientCountString is empty before parsing it as an integer. If it's empty, it sets a default value of -1. This will prevent the NumberFormatException from occurring.\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The issue in your code is that you are not considering the case when the clientCountString is empty, which is causing the NumberFormatException.

The messages I'm sending are 25 kilos with the first 5 bytes containing the count from the client in the form of a string padded with asterisks to maintain a 5 byte length. However after 3 or 4 successful messages the server fails to find the count. Is there something that I am forgetting to consider? My guess is that the server is having trouble keeping up with the client as the number of successful messages varies from 3 - 4 before error.CLIENT SIDE CODE:try{        clientSocket = new Socket(\"192.168.0.15\", SERVER_PORT);           DataInputStream in = new DataInputStream(clientSocket.getInputStream());        DataOutputStream out = new DataOutputStream(clientSocket.getOutputStream());        int messageCounter = 0;        byte [] message1 = new byte[25 * 1024];        byte [] returnMessage1 = new byte[25 * 1024];        byte [] count;        long startTime1 = System.nanoTime();        while (messageCounter < 100000) {            System.out.println(messageCounter);            addCountToMessage(formatCount(messageCounter).getBytes(), message1);            out.write(message1);            in.read(returnMessage1);                 messageCounter ++;            }      }SERVER SIDE CODE: try {      byte [] data = new byte[35 * 1024];      System.out.println(\"STARTING LOOP\");      System.out.println(\"***********************************\");      int messageCounter = 0;      int clientMessageCount = 0;      String clientCountString = \"\";      byte[] clientCount = new byte[5];      while (true){          in.read(data);          clientCount[0] = data[0];          clientCount[1] = data[1];          clientCount[2] = data[2];          clientCount[3] = data[3];          clientCount[4] = data[4];          clientCountString = new String(clientCount);          System.out.println(\"Received Count String: \\\"\" + clientCountString + \"\\\"\");          clientCountString = clientCountString.replace(\"*\", \"\");          clientMessageCount = Integer.parseInt(clientCountString);          System.out.println(\"Client Count: \" + clientMessageCount + \", Server Count: \" + messageCounter);          out.write(data);          System.out.println(\"***********************************\");          messageCounter ++;      }   }OUTPUT OF SERVER:java TCPServerSTARTING LOOPReceived Count String: \"0****\"Client Count: 0, Server Count: 0Received Count String: \"1****\"Client Count: 1, Server Count: 1Received Count String: \"2****\"Client Count: 2, Server Count: 2Received Count String: \"3****\"Client Count: 3, Server Count: 3Received Count String: \"\"Exception in thread \"Thread-0\" java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: \"\"at java.lang.NumberFormatException.forInputString(NumberFormatException.java:65)at java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Integer.java:481)at java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Integer.java:527)at Connection.run(TCPServer.java:52)\nPlease using this api: DataOutputStream.write.\nAnswer:"
