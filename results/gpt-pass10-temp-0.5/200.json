The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Unable to write commands onto an exe program on shared location using java: :I've an exe program placed on shared location. It doesn't take any arguments while starting. When it is launched in a command window, it displays a help menu with list of commands that can be executed with it and ends with > expecting an input command. I need to execute one particular command called TRIGGER from that list. So far this is what I've but it fails completely. It neither displays the output from the process nor takes the input command trigger from the stream. public void execute(){    String cmd = \"\\\\\\\\sharedLocation\\\\server\\\\adm.exe\";    p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(cmd);    InputStream in = p.getInputStream();    OutputStream out = p.getOutputStream();    BufferedReader br= new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(in));    BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(out));    bw.write(\"TRIGGER\");                bw.flush();    String output = \"\";    while (!output.endsWith(\">\")) {             System.out.println(\"in loop\");        output = output + br.readLine();     }    System.out.println(\"Out\"+output);    out.close();                p.waitFor();}EDIT : adm.exe is launched by this program but it appears that adm.exe is a blocking process.
