It is related to the input connection of your Android application. As for your socket implementation, it seems correct. You are closing the socket in the finally block, which ensures that the socket is closed even if an exception occurs. However, you can improve your implementation by using a try-with-resources block to automatically close the resources. Here is an example:\n\ntry (Socket socket = new Socket(mServerName, mport);\n     DataOutputStream out = new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());\n     InputStreamReader inFromServer = new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream());\n     BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(inFromServer)) {\n    // Your code here\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n\nUsing try-with-resources will automatically close the resources at the end of the block, eliminating the need for the finally block."

But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Transmit and Receive Socket Implementation in Android: :I am currently developing socket communication between android and server, which is a simple java program run in terminal. Things are going well except there is a warning always appears in the logCat when I close the application:  IInputConnectionWrapper    showStatusIcon on inactive InputConnectionI am searching on the internet to find out the problem I found a post in StackOverflow Similar Problem. The difference is that I can send and receive information well in my program. The answer to this similar problem is that connection is not closed. Does that mean I didn't call socket.close(); after operation? That leads to a more complicated problem of implementation. First of all,  I want a single, static socket to listen and send to a server. Because I might not close the socket every time I transmit something, so I just close it after the listener finishes the work.Detail codes are posted belowI initialize connection in the constructor as:client = new Socket(mServerName, mport);out = new DataOutputStream(client.getOutputStream()); inFromServer = new InputStreamReader(client.getInputStream());reader = new BufferedReader(inFromServer);And let them be there during the whole process.I wrote transmitting from android to server into a function as following:public void sendRequest(int type, int what1, int what2, Object data){    try{        if(client.isConnected())        {            out.writeUTF(encoded(type,what1,what2,data) + \"\\n\");                    }    }catch(IOException e){        Log.e(TAG, \"IOException at SendRequest\");        e.printStackTrace();    }}Listener in a new thread:try {               String line = null;        while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null)        {            ReceiveHandler(line);        }    } catch (IOException e) {        Log.e(TAG, \"IOException at StartListen\");        e.printStackTrace();    }finally{        try {          // The Only Place that I close the Socket            inFromServer.close();            out.close();            reader.close();            client.close();        } catch (IOException e) {            Log.e(TAG, \"Close Socket with IOException \" + e.toString());            e.printStackTrace();        }     }My Question is:Is there something wrong with my implementation or are there better ways to do this?Thanks so much for your help!\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
