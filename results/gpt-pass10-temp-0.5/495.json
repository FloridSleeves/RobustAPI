The iterator is synchronized to ensure thread safety. Each call to getStudentInfo() will get a different set of rows from the shared iterator.\n\nNote: This code assumes that the StudentDAO class is responsible for fetching the rows from the database and populating the rows list. You will need to modify the fetchRowsFromDatabase() method to fetch the rows for a specific student based on the current state of the iterator."
