The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: RXTX how to reading from com port: :Hi i have somthing like thispackage compot;import java.util.Enumeration;import gnu.io.*;public class core {    private static SerialPort p;    /**     * @param args     */    public static void main(String[] args)     {        Enumeration ports = CommPortIdentifier.getPortIdentifiers();        System.out.println(\"start\");        while(ports.hasMoreElements())        {            CommPortIdentifier port = (CommPortIdentifier) ports.nextElement();            System.out.print(port.getName() + \" -> \" + port.getCurrentOwner() + \" -> \");            switch(port.getPortType())            {                case CommPortIdentifier.PORT_PARALLEL:                    System.out.println(\"parell\");                break;                case CommPortIdentifier.PORT_SERIAL:                    //System.out.println(\"serial\");                try {                    p = (SerialPort) port.open(\"core\", 1000);                    int baudRate = 57600; // 57600bps                    p.setSerialPortParams(                            baudRate,                            SerialPort.DATABITS_8,                            SerialPort.STOPBITS_1,                            SerialPort.PARITY_NONE);                } catch (PortInUseException e) {                    System.out.println(e.getMessage());                } catch (UnsupportedCommOperationException e) {                    System.out.println(e.getMessage());                }                break;            }        }        System.out.println(\"stop\");    }}But I dont know how to read from port ??
