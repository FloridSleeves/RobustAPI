When you receive data from a client, you iterate through the list and find the socket associated with the selected client (`if (client == s)`). Then, you use the `DataOutputStream` of that socket to send the data back to the selected client.\n\nNote: This is a basic example and assumes that you have a way to identify the selected client. You may need to modify this code to fit your specific requirements."
