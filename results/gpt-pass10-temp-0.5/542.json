When you assign a new instance of Tile to \"tile\", it does not affect the original array \"myTiles\". So when you try to access \"myTiles[0].getNumber()\" in another method, it throws a NullPointerException because \"myTiles[0]\" is still null.\nIn the second example, you are directly assigning a new instance of Tile to \"this.myTiles[number-1]\", which modifies the original array \"myTiles\". So when you access \"myTiles[0].getNumber()\" in another method, it works correctly because \"myTiles[0]\" is no longer null.\n<<<explanation>>>: In Java, when you use a for-each loop, you are actually iterating over a copy of the array elements, not the actual array itself. Therefore, any modifications made to the loop variable \"tile\" will not affect the original array. To modify the original array, you need to access its elements directly using their indices, as shown in the second example."
