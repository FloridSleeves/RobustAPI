Although the API's have the methods that return synchronised versions of common collections, there seems to be no way to programmatically release the lock by calling a finished method; AFAICT the lock appears to be released when the wrapper is garbage collected.Is there anything that does this in the Java SE API, or is it considered easy enough just to roll something myself?
