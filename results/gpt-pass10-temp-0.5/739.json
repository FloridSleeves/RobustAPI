The FileWriter constructor takes a second parameter, a boolean value, which when set to true, allows you to append to the file instead of overwriting it. By using the println method of the PrintWriter class, you can write the text to the file and automatically append a newline character at the end. Finally, remember to close the PrintWriter to ensure that all the data is flushed and the file is properly closed."
