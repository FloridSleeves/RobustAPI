You can create a Singleton class for your SQLiteOpenHelper and use it across your activities.\n\nHere's an example of how you can implement it:\n\n1. Create a Singleton class for your SQLiteOpenHelper:\n\npublic class DatabaseHelper extends SQLiteOpenHelper {\n    private static DatabaseHelper instance;\n\n    private DatabaseHelper(Context context) {\n        super(context, \"MyDatabase\", null, 1);\n    }\n\n    public static synchronized DatabaseHelper getInstance(Context context) {\n        if (instance == null) {\n            instance = new DatabaseHelper(context.getApplicationContext());\n        }\n        return instance;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onCreate(SQLiteDatabase db) {\n        // Create your database tables here\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onUpgrade(SQLiteDatabase db, int oldVersion, int newVersion) {\n        // Upgrade your database here\n    }\n}\n\n2. In your activities, use the getInstance() method to get the instance of DatabaseHelper:\n\nDatabaseHelper dbHelper = DatabaseHelper.getInstance(getApplicationContext());\nSQLiteDatabase db = dbHelper.getWritableDatabase();\n\n// Perform your database operations here\n\n3. Close the database connection when you're done with it:\n\ndb.close();\n\nBy using this approach, you ensure that there is only one instance of DatabaseHelper throughout your application, and you can use it in multiple activities without any conflicts. Remember to always close the database connection when you're done with it to avoid any resource leaks."
