To solve this, you can manually write the string in smaller chunks using the writeBytes method. This code snippet shows how to write a long string in chunks of 1955 characters. You can adjust the chunkSize variable to fit your needs."

To overcome this limitation, you can try using the write(byte[] b, int off, int len) method of DataOutputStream. This method allows you to write a portion of a byte array to the output stream. By breaking your command into smaller chunks and writing them one by one, you can avoid the limitation on the maximum number of characters.

Remove the `response = in.readLine();` line after `out.flush();`. This line is reading an extra response line from the server, which may cause issues with longer commands.\n4. Finally, change the return statement to `return response.trim();` to remove any leading/trailing whitespace from the response."
