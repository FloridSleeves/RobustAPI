However, the issue you are facing could be related to the execution of the queries using Statement.executeUpdate(). It is possible that some queries are causing the process to hang without any error message. To troubleshoot this issue, you can try the following steps:\n\n1. Add logging statements or print statements to check the progress of the restoration process. This can help you identify the specific query that is causing the hang.\n2. Verify the integrity of the SQL dump file. Make sure it does not contain any errors or inconsistencies.\n3. Check the database logs for any error messages or warnings related to the restoration process.\n4. Consider using a different approach for executing the restoration queries, such as using a batch update or prepared statements.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue with your MySQL restoration process."

Make sure you are handling exceptions properly and logging any error messages or stack traces.\n2. Check if there are any constraints or dependencies in your database that might be causing the execution to hang.\n3. Verify if the SQL file you are using for restoration is correct and does not have any errors.\n4. Try executing the queries one by one manually to see if any specific query is causing the issue.\n5. Consider using a different approach for restoration, such as using database backup and restore utilities provided by MySQL instead of executing queries manually.\nIf none of these suggestions help, you may need to provide more information or seek help from a MySQL expert or community forum."
