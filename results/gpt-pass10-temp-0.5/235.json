One way to work around this is to use the mark() and reset() methods provided by the Reader class. The mark() method sets a marker at the current position in the stream, and the reset() method resets the stream back to the marked position. In the code snippet above, we use a StringBuilder to read the characters from the Reader and append them to the StringBuilder. Before starting the reading process, we call the mark(0) method to set the marker at the beginning of the stream. After reading the characters, we call the reset() method to reset the stream back to the marked position. Finally, we convert the StringBuilder to a String and return it."

The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Why do I get exception error while trying to reset Reader to 0 position?: :I'm trying to read a webpage using following code :URL url = new URL(\"somewebsitecomeshere\");                URLConnection c = url.openConnection();                if(getHttpResponseCode(c) == 200)                {                    if (isContentValid(c))//accept html/xml only!                    {                        InputStream is = c.getInputStream();                        Reader r = new InputStreamReader(is);                        System.out.println(r.toString());                                                //after commenting this everything works great!                        setHTMLString(getStringFromReader(r));                        System.out.println(getHTMLString());                        ParserDelegator parser = new ParserDelegator();                        parser.parse(r, new Parser(url), true);                        r.close();                        is.close();                        try {                            Thread.sleep(500);                        } catch (InterruptedException e) {                            // TODO Auto-generated catch block                            e.printStackTrace();                        }                    }                    else                        log(\"content is not valid!\");                }                else                {                    System.out.println(\"ERROR\" + c.getContentType() + c.getURL());                }//---------------------------------------------------    private String getStringFromReader(Reader reader) throws IOException {          char[] arr = new char[8*1024]; // 8K at a time          StringBuffer buf = new StringBuffer();          int numChars;          while ((numChars = reader.read(arr, 0, arr.length)) > 0) {              buf.append(arr, 0, numChars);          }              //Reset position to 0          reader.reset();          return buf.toString();            }if try to read string using getStringFromReader() the rest of the code will be ignored due to changing position of Reader to EOF so I tried to reset the position to 0 but I got the following error :java.io.IOException: reset() not supported    at java.io.Reader.reset(Unknown Source)    at sample.getStringFromReader(Spider.java:248)    at default(sample.java:286)    at default.main(sample.java:130)How can I reset the Reader position to 0?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
