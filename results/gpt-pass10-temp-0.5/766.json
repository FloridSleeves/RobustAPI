I've been searching on the net on how to accomplish this over the last couple of days but I wasn't able to come to a solution.Can someone advise me on what code to use to accomplish my task?Thanks so much!public class ReadFile1 {public static void main(String[] a)throws IOException{showDir(1, new File(\"/Users/User/Documents/1 eclipse test/testfolder1\"));//File file = new File(\"/Users/User/Documents/1 eclipse test/testfolder1/puppy4.txt\");//long fileSize = file.length();}static void showDir(int indent, File file) throws IOException { for (int i = 0; i < indent; i++)      System.out.print('-');System.out.println(file.getName() + \" - \" + file.length() / 1024 + \" KB\");  if (file.isDirectory()) {  File[] files = file.listFiles();  for (int i = 0; i < files.length; i++)    showDir(indent + 4, files[i]);     }}}\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
