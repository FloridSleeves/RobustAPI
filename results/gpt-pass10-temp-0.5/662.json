That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Write String to a text file: :I have this code that gets GPS data from input stream make the test file but there is nothing inside. Can you please tell me what is the problem in here? public void run ()        {            byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];            int len = -1;            try            {                while ( ( len = this.in.read(buffer)) > -1 )                {                    String gpsInfo = new String(buffer,0,len);                    PrintWriter data = new PrintWriter(\"test.txt\");                    data.println(gpsInfo);                    System.out.print(gpsInfo);                }            }            catch ( IOException e )            {                e.printStackTrace();            }                    }I am getting the right console output.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
