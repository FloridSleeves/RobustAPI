However, you can refer to the documentation and examples provided by the library you are using to establish an SSH connection and read data from the InputStream.\nHere is a general outline of how you can establish an SSH connection using JSch library:\n\n1. Add the JSch library to your project. You can download it from the official website or use a dependency management tool like Maven or Gradle.\n\n2. Import the necessary classes in your Java file:\n```\nimport com.jcraft.jsch.*;\n\n3. Create an instance of the JSch class and set up the session:\n```\nJSch jsch = new JSch();\nSession session = jsch.getSession(\"username\", \"hostname\", 22);\nsession.setPassword(\"password\");\nsession.setConfig(\"StrictHostKeyChecking\", \"no\");\nsession.connect();\n\n4. Open a channel and connect:\n```\nChannel channel = session.openChannel(\"shell\");\nchannel.connect();\n\n5. Get the input stream from the channel and read data:\n```\nInputStream inputStream = channel.getInputStream();\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\nint bytesRead;\nwhile ((bytesRead = inputStream.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n    // process the read data\n}\n\n6. Close the channel and session when done:\n```\nchannel.disconnect();\nsession.disconnect();\n\nPlease refer to the documentation and examples provided by the SSH library you choose for more specific instructions on establishing an SSH connection and reading data from the InputStream."

It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time.
