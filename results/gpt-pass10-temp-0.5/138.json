This results in unnecessary memory allocation and can lead to an `OutOfMemoryError` when the heap space is limited. \n\nTo avoid this issue, you can create a `ByteBuffer` from the `randomByteString` once and then pass a duplicate of it to each thread. By using `byteBuffer.duplicate()`, you create a new `ByteBuffer` that shares the same underlying byte array as the original `ByteBuffer`, but has its own position, limit, and mark. This way, each thread can independently read from the `ByteBuffer` without allocating additional memory.\n\nAdditionally, I have made some modifications to the `SlidingBubbles` class to properly handle exceptions and close resources in a `finally` block. It is important to close the `FileChannel` and `RandomAccessFile` to release system resources and prevent resource leaks."

To fix this, you should create the RandomAccessFile and FileChannel outside of the while loop in the `doIt()` method and share them among the threads. Additionally, you can optimize the writing process by using a single ByteBuffer and repeatedly calling `fc.write()` until the buffer has been fully written. This way, you don't need to create a new ByteBuffer for each write operation. Finally, make sure to properly close the resources in the `finally` block to avoid resource leaks."

I dont want to have to specify the number of bytes to read. I want to be able to read the object directly using Object Input Stream. How to achieve this ?

As you can see from the code, thatString is created only once, but then used multiple times from both threads.Shouldn't the threads be using just a reference to the String rather than copying it? (which would, in this case, exceed the 40MB allowance).I must also point out that it is (or at least seems to be, as far as my understanding goes) impossible to increase this heap space on Gingerbread (previous research).Is there anything I'm missing?Any help is greatly appreciated.\nPlease using this api: FileChannel.write.\nAnswer:"
