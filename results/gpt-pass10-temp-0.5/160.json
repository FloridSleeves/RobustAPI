It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Easymock partially mocking (EasyMock ClassExtension), good or bad?: :I have written quite a few Mock objects using EasyMock. However, often i find writing partial mocks time consuming, and it does not feel 'right'.I'd say its a design fault as my class I try to mock has multiple concerns into one, therefore I should create seperate classes in order to seperate concerns.What do you think? Is partially mocking a good or bad thing? And, if good/bad, why? What would you suggest if you notice you cannot mock the object because you only want to mock a few methods?\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
