You can define different lexer modes for different sections of your language, such as the \"first line\" requirement or a multi-line command. \n\nFor example, you can define a lexer rule for the \"first line\" requirement in a separate lexer mode:\nFIRST_LINE : 'X requirement' -> mode(RequirementMode);\n\nThen, in the RequirementMode, you can define lexer rules specific to that mode:\nREQUIREMENT : . ; // match any character\n\nSimilarly, you can define a lexer rule for the start of a multi-line command:\nSTART_COMMAND : 'START_COMMAND' -> mode(CommandMode);\n\nAnd in the CommandMode, you can define lexer rules specific to handling the multi-line command:\nCOMMAND_CONTENT : . ; // match any character\n\nIn your parser, you can then define different parser rules to handle the different lexer modes and their corresponding tokens.\n\nBy using lexer modes, you can handle different parts of your language separately and ensure that the syntax is checked correctly. You can also define separate parser rules to handle the different parts of your language.\n\nIf you need to handle complex interactions between different parts of your language, you may need to use more advanced techniques such as building an abstract syntax tree (AST) or using visitor pattern to traverse the AST.\n\n<<<explanation>>>: ANTLR provides lexer modes that allow you to handle different parts of your language separately.

Here is an example of how you can modify the traditional line-by-line approach to handle your requirements:\n\n1. Create a Lexer that tokenizes the input stream. You can define tokens for different types of lines, such as \"first line\" and \"command line\".\n\n2. Modify your Parser rules to handle the different types of lines. For example, you can have separate rules for parsing the \"first line\" and \"command line\" syntax.\n\n3. Instead of using a while loop to read lines, you can use ANTLR's Lexer and Parser to process the input stream token by token. You can create a custom input stream that reads from System.in and feeds the tokens to the Lexer.\n\n4. As you process each token, you can perform the necessary actions based on the type of line. For example, if it's a \"first line\", you can store the requirement information for later use. If it's a \"command line\", you can execute the command.\n\n5. If a command is split into multiple lines, you can use ANTLR's lexer modes to handle the multiline syntax. You can define a lexer mode for multiline commands and switch to that mode when encountering the start of a multiline command. The lexer will then tokenize the input accordingly.\n\n6. If there are instructions you don't want to run twice, you can use a separate data structure to keep track of the executed instructions and check against it before executing a command.\n\nBy using ANTLR's Lexer and Parser, you can handle the syntax and semantics of your interactive language in a structured and efficient way."
