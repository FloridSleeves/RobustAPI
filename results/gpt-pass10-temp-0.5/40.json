I am confused how does it work? why doesn't it give error just like we get in java code? and most importantly, how does environment decide to which component it needs to invoke? I understand the process of id generation is automated, which gets added to R.java For instance, if we have same IDs, say \"image1\" in two XMLs, say \"layout1\" & \"layout2\". but in R.java it won't have 2 IDs. that means at a time it will reference only 1 component. In case we have to use 2 XMLs in an Activity, one as activity.setcontentview(layout1) and another as a PopupWindow.setContentView(layout2). What will happen in such case?\nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: Activity.setContentView\n<<<code>>>: @Override\npublic void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n    Button myButton = (Button) findViewById(R.id.my_button);\n}\n<<<explanation>>>: You can findViewById of the current view hierarchy set to the activity. You cannot have same id for the view's in the same view tree. (must be unique).\nQuestion: How to switch xml layout ordering: :I was wondering how to change the the layout of an xml file based on a conditional.  So lets say we have a layout as such..<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <LinearLayout xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\" android:orientation=\"vertical\" android:layout_width=\"fill_parent\" android:layout_height=\"fill_parent\"><LinearLayout xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\" android:orientation=\"vertical\" android:layout_width=\"fill_parent\" android:layout_height=\"fill_parent\" android:background=\"@drawable/app_background\" android:padding=\"5dip\" ><ListView android:id=\"@+id/xlist\"            android:layout_width=\"fill_parent\"            android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"            android:cacheColorHint=\"#00000000\"            android:divider=\"@drawable/listdivider\"            android:dividerHeight=\"19dp\"           />  <TextView               android:layout_width=\"fill_parent\"              android:background=\"@drawable/listdivider\"              android:layout_height=\"19dp\"              android:visibility=\"gone\"             android:id=\"@+id/dividerline\"              />  <ListView android:id=\"@+id/ylist\"            android:layout_width=\"fill_parent\"            android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"            android:cacheColorHint=\"#00000000\"             android:divider=\"@drawable/listdivider\"            android:dividerHeight=\"19dp\"           /></LinearLayout></LinearLayout>So you set two Variables as listviews, and based on the xml the \"xlist\" will appear before the \"ylist\".  But for my code I would like to switch the ordering of this view if a certain condition is met.  So how would I go about switching the order so that if a certain condition is met, the \"ylist\" will appear above the \"xlist\"?\nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer:"
