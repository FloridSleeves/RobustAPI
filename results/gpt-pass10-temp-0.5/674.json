That prints 123 but it is supposed to print 1. How can I fix that?\n\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: PrintWriter.write\n<<<code>>>: try { printWriter.write(\"1\n\"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n<<<explanation>>>: The problem is that you are writing string without a line break. But BufferedReader expects one of the line characters mentioned above which you are not providing. It does output the whole buffer once the end of the stream is reached though.\nQuestion: Where compiled code will be stored if not in class file: :Recently I came across a query while reading THE STRUCTURE OF THE JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINEOn page no-5 ch. 2,Compiled code to be executed by the Java Virtual Machine is  represented using a hardware- and operating system-independent binary  format, typically (but not necessarily) stored in a file, known as the  class file format.That bracket But not necessarily is the reason.Question is, In which case compiled code will not be stored in class file ? and if it will not be stored in class file, then where and how ?Edit : Please note that question is not about ClassLoader.\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
