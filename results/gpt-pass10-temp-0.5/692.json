Writing refers to modifying or creating a new file.\n\nThe PrintWriter class is used for writing formatted text to a file. It is similar to FileWriter, but provides additional functionality for formatting the output. Here is an example of how to use PrintWriter:\n\nimport java.io.File;\nimport java.io.FileNotFoundException;\nimport java.io.PrintWriter;\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class FileExample {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        try {\n            // Create a PrintWriter object to write to a file\n            PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"output.txt\");\n\n            // Read the input file\n            File inputFile = new File(\"input.txt\");\n            Scanner scanner = new Scanner(inputFile);\n\n            // Process each line and write it to the output file\n            while (scanner.hasNextLine()) {\n                String line = scanner.nextLine();\n\n                // Modify the line as needed\n                String modifiedLine = line + \" - modified\";\n\n                // Write the modified line to the output file\n                writer.println(modifiedLine);\n            }\n\n            // Close the resources\n            writer.close();\n            scanner.close();\n        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nIn this example, we create a PrintWriter object named \"writer\" to write to a file named \"output.txt\". We then read the input file using a Scanner object and process each line. The modified line is written to the output file using the PrintWriter's println method. Finally, we close the resources to free up system resources.\n\nNote that PrintWriter automatically flushes the output buffer, so you don't need to explicitly call the flush method."

For reading a file I know you can use Scanner and read it and then print it. However reading a file and then printing it in a new format, like double space, indents, basically any spacing issues, is that also considered reading it or is it writing it? From my understanding of what my teacher has taught me, is that writing overwrites the original document and replaces it. Also how does one use the PrintWriter command? I have never seen this before in my class nor have read about it in my textbook but its on my test according to my teacher. Could someone give an explanation and an example about it? I read this site http://www.caveofprogramming.com/frontpage/articles/java/java-file-reading-and-writing-files-in-java/ on writing files, but it uses FileWriter, which I'm assuming takes the place of scanner? Is that right?\nPlease using this api: PrintWriter.write.\nAnswer:"
