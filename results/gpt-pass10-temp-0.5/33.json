I am confused how does it work? why doesn't it give error just like we get in java code? and most importantly, how does environment decide to which component it needs to invoke? I understand the process of id generation is automated, which gets added to R.java For instance, if we have same IDs, say \"image1\" in two XMLs, say \"layout1\" & \"layout2\". but in R.java it won't have 2 IDs. that means at a time it will reference only 1 component.

I wanted to simply create a class (like SimpleSessionManager) that would implement location and sensor event listeners for me. Is there a way to do this utilizing a simple class via constructors, or is there a way to run the helper class as a background activity? From what I understand, I can not implement the event listeners through extending the Service class. Is this correct? Running it as a simple background activity would be ideal because then I could utilize the findViewById() method, but I can't seem to figure out how to do this with the Listeners responding as I had hoped. If the Fragment class would work, can someone point me in the direction of a related example as all that I can find I can't seem to get my implementation to work with.\nPlease using this api: Activity.setContentView.\nAnswer:"
