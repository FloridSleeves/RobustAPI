The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Looking for Java Telnet emulator: :Closed.

It is not currently accepting answers.

Improve this question                    I am writing a back end program that telnets into a server, runs some commands and saves all the output from those commands.  Something just like Expect.I would like to use an open source solution that is well supported and runs with JDK 6.  I have found 3 options so far and would like some help deciding which one (or a better suggestion) to use.commons-net \u2013 This is very well supported but I having trouble getting a simple \u201cLog in and do \u2018ls\u2019\u201d command working.  I would prefer to use this library, if anyone can provide a simple example (and not the example that comes with it that takes input from the user) I would like to go that route.  If I\u2019m unable to use commons-net the next two options are:JExpect \u2013 This is not that hard to use, does what I need but how well supported is it?  Will it work with JDK 6, I think so.Java Telnet Application (jta26) \u2013 This was easy to use but I\u2019m not sure how versatile it is.  I didn\u2019t see any place to set a timeout value in the TelnetWrapper.  I also was not sure if this code is being maintained since the last update to the site was in 2005. (http://www.javassh.org)I know this is somewhat opinion oriented and hope SO is a good place to help me make a decision so I don\u2019t start down one road and find out later it\u2019s not what I\u2019m looking for.  Thanks.\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
