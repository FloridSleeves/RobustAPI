One possible reason is that the file is not being properly read and written in the server code. Here are a few suggestions to try:\n\n1. Make sure that the file is being read and written correctly in the server code. Check if the file is being opened and closed properly and if the data is being written to the file correctly.\n\n2. Verify that the file path and file name are correct in both the client and server code. Make sure that the file is being saved to the correct location.\n\n3. Check if there are any errors or exceptions being thrown in the server code. Print out any error messages or stack traces to help identify the issue.\n\n4. Verify that the WebSocket connection is established correctly and that the client is sending the file data properly. Check if the file data is being sent in the correct format and if it is being received correctly by the server.\n\n5. Consider using a different WebSocket library or framework to see if the issue persists. It's possible that there may be a bug or limitation in the current library you are using.\n\n6. Test the server code with a smaller file to see if the issue is related to the file size. It's possible that there may be a limitation or configuration setting that is causing the issue with larger files.\n\n7. Consider using a different file transfer method or protocol, such as HTTP or FTP, to see if the issue persists. This can help determine if the issue is specific to the WebSocket implementation or if it is a more general file transfer issue.\n\n<<<explanation>>>: The provided code does not directly use the FileChannel.write API.
