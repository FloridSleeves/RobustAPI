This may not always be the desired encoding, as different systems may have different default encodings.\n\nIn the second way, you explicitly specify the character encoding by passing it as a parameter to the getBytes() method. This ensures that the string is converted into bytes using the specified encoding, in this case, UTF-8.\n\nIt is generally recommended to specify the character encoding explicitly to avoid any potential issues with different encodings on different systems."

However, the `getBytes()` method is an instance method, not a static method, so it can only be called on an instance of the `String` class, not on the class itself. That's why you can't declare your byte array with the second way. \n\nTo get the byte array representation of a string using a specific charset, you can use the first way and pass the charset as a parameter to the `getBytes()` method, as shown in the second line of the code snippet."
