One way to achieve this is by using a common interface, such as OutputStream, and creating different implementations for each type of output stream you want to use.\n\nFor example, you can create a class that implements OutputStream and internally holds a reference to the current output stream type. This class can have methods to switch between different output stream types and delegate the write operations to the current output stream.\n\nHere is an example implementation:\n\n```java\npublic class SwitchableOutputStream extends OutputStream {\n    private OutputStream outputStream;\n\n    public void setOutputStream(OutputStream outputStream) {\n        this.outputStream = outputStream;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void write(int b) throws IOException {\n        if (outputStream != null) {\n            outputStream.write(b);\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Implement other write methods similarly\n\n    public void switchToDataOutputStream(DataOutputStream dataOutputStream) {\n        outputStream = dataOutputStream;\n    }\n\n    public void switchToPrintWriter(PrintWriter printWriter) {\n        outputStream = printWriter;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou can then use this SwitchableOutputStream class to switch between different output stream types without closing and reopening the socket. For example:\n\n```java\nSocket socket = new Socket(\"localhost\", 1234);\nSwitchableOutputStream switchableOutputStream = new SwitchableOutputStream();\nswitchableOutputStream.setOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());\n\n// Sending text command \"INFO\"\nswitchableOutputStream.switchToDataOutputStream(new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream()));\nswitchableOutputStream.writeBytes(\"INFO\");\n\n// Sending object with information\nswitchableOutputStream.switchToObjectOutputStream(new ObjectOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream()));\nswitchableOutputStream.writeObject(object);\n\n// Sending text command \"DATA\"\nswitchableOutputStream.switchToPrintWriter(new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream()));\nswitchableOutputStream.write(\"DATA\");\n\n// Sending data\nswitchableOutputStream.switchToDataOutputStream(new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream()));\nswitchableOutputStream.write(data);\n\n// Close the socket when done\nsocket.close();\n```\n\nThis way, you can switch between different types of output streams within the same socket/connection without closing and reopening it."
