                "content": "<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: To compress the HTTP request, you can make use of the GZIP compression algorithm. Here is an example of how you can compress the request using GZIP:\n\n1. Enable GZIP compression in your Tomcat server by adding the following line to your server.xml file:\n\n<Connector port=\"8080\" protocol=\"HTTP/1.1\" compression=\"on\" compressableMimeType=\"application/json\"/>\n\n2. In your mobile app, before sending the request, compress the JSON data using GZIPOutputStream:\n\nByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();\nGZIPOutputStream gzip = new GZIPOutputStream(baos);\ngzip.write(jsonData.getBytes());\ngzip.close();\n\nbyte[] compressedData = baos.toByteArray();\n\n3. Set the Content-Encoding header of your request to \"gzip\" and send the compressed data:\n\nHttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();\nconnection.setRequestMethod(\"POST\");\nconnection.setRequestProperty(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json\");\nconnection.setRequestProperty(\"Content-Encoding\", \"gzip\");\nconnection.setDoOutput(true);\n\nOutputStream os = connection.getOutputStream();\nos.write(compressedData);\nos.flush();\nos.close();\n\n4. On the server side, you can use a filter to decompress the request before it reaches your servlet. Here is an example of a decompression filter using the GZIPInputStream:\n\npublic class DecompressionFilter implements Filter {\n    public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain) throws IOException, ServletException {\n        HttpServletRequest httpRequest = (HttpServletRequest) request;\n        HttpServletResponse httpResponse = (HttpServletResponse) response;\n        \n        if (\"gzip\".equals(httpRequest.getHeader(\"Content-Encoding\"))) {\n            InputStream is = httpRequest.getInputStream();\n            GZIPInputStream gzip = new GZIPInputStream(is);\n            \n            chain.doFilter(new HttpServletRequestWrapper(httpRequest) {\n                @Override\n                public ServletInputStream getInputStream() throws IOException {\n                    return new ServletInputStreamWrapper(gzip);\n                }\n            }, httpResponse);\n        } else {\n            chain.doFilter(request, response);\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // other filter methods\n}\n\n5. Add the filter to your web.xml file:\n\n<filter>\n    <filter-name>decompressionFilter</filter-name>\n    <filter-class>com.example.DecompressionFilter</filter-class>\n</filter>\n<filter-mapping>\n    <filter-name>decompressionFilter</filter-name>\n    <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>\n</filter-mapping>\n\nThis way, the request will be compressed on the client side, sent to the server with the Content-Encoding header set to \"gzip\", and then decompressed by the decompression filter before reaching your servlet."

My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: HTTP request compression: :General Use-CaseImagine a client that is uploading large amounts of JSON. The Content-Type should remain application/json because that describes the actual data. Accept-Encoding and Transfer-Encoding seem to be for telling the server how it should format the response. It appears that responses use the Content-Encoding header explicitly for this purpose, but it is not a valid request header.Is there something I am missing? Has anyone found an elegant solution?Specific Use-CaseMy use-case is that I have a mobile app that is generating large amounts of JSON (and some binary data in some cases but to a lesser extent) and compressing the requests saves a large amount of bandwidth. I am using Tomcat as my Servlet container. I am using Spring for its MVC annotations primarily just to abstract away some of the JEE stuff into a much cleaner, annotation-based interface. I also use Jackson for auto (de)serialization.I also use nginx, but I am not sure if thats where I want the decompression to take place. The nginx nodes simply balance the requests which are then distributed through the data center. It would be just as nice to keep it compressed until it actually got to the node that was going to process it.Thanks in advance,JohnEDIT:The discussion between myself and @DaSourcerer was really helpful for those that are curious about the state of things at the time of writing this.I ended up implementing a solution of my own. Note that this specifies the branch \"ohmage-3.0\", but it will soon be merged into the master branch.
