In this example, a buffer of size 1024 bytes is used to read the data from the input stream. The bytesRead variable stores the number of bytes read in each iteration. The totalBytesRead variable keeps track of the total number of bytes read. The startTime variable is set to the current time before starting the read loop. The endTime variable is set to the current time after the read loop completes. The duration variable calculates the time taken for the transfer in milliseconds. The bandwidth variable calculates the average bandwidth in bytes per second by dividing the totalBytesRead by the duration and multiplying by 1000. Finally, the bandwidth is printed to the console."

The problem is that InputStream.read() takes an eternity, processing 200kb takes something around 30 seconds. My code: client = new Socket(\"192.168.1.1\", 1235);\nclient.setTcpNoDelay(true);\nclient.setReceiveBufferSize(1048576);\nInputStream is = client.getInputStream();\n\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1048576];\nint i = 0;\nint length = -1;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    int b = is.read();\n    if (b == -1)\n    {\n        success = false;\n        break;\n    }\n    buffer[i] = (byte) b;\n\n    if (i == length)\n        break;\n\n                                    if (i == 3)\n                                    {\n                                                length = buffer[0] | buffer[1] << 8 | buffer[2] << 16 | buffer[3] << 24;\n                                                    \n                                        }\n\n                                        i++;\n\n        }\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:<<<api>>>: InputStream.read\n<<<code>>>: final byte[] lengthBuffer = new byte[3];\ntry{\n    int b = is.read(lengthBuffer);\n    // make sure b was 3 and do your length calculation\n    final byte buffer = new byte[length];\n    b = is.read(buffer);\n    // check b and then you have your bytes}\nexcept {System.out.println(\"Something went wrong.\");\")}\n<<<explanation>>>: Why are you reading each byte individually? It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Measure bandwith used in transfering files with java sockets: :Does anyone knows how to do this? using the java sockets\nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
