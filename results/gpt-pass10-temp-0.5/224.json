First, skip the desired number of bytes using the `skip()` method of the input stream. Make sure to check the return value to ensure that the correct number of bytes were skipped. Then, create a new input stream that reads from the current position of the original input stream and has a limited length. This can be achieved by implementing a custom `LimitedInputStream` class that extends `InputStream` and overrides the `read()` method to limit the number of bytes read. Use this new input stream, `isB`, to read the desired sub-stream."

It looks like you really want to read the first 3 bytes and figure out your length and then read that block. Then you can at least get the optimizations that Inputstream can provide for reading blocks of data rather than one byte at a time. And you are not allocating that mega array like you currently have.\nQuestion: Bring out inputstream from inputstream: :i need to bring out inputstream from inputstream , for example inputstream A is 1024 byte and i need to bring out inputstream B from A of Hundred and fiftieth byte  to end , from certain offset to certain end . i search in google and stackoverflow ...Is there any solution available in java ??         \nPlease using this api: InputStream.read.\nAnswer:"
